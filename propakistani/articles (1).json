They say you will have time to spend with your family. They say you will be your own boss. Nobody tells you that too much freedom, too much flexibility, too much family time and being your boss is asking for trouble, especially when it comes to the source of your earning. If you relate with any of the five reasons illustrated below, run as far away from freelancing as possible!</p><p>It the source of your social life; complaining about the work load at the office and gossiping about the new employees is actually how you met your best friend. If you are not working at this job, and take up freelancing, you will be working at home alone. You will face \u2018social drought\u2019 to the extent where the lack of human contact will make you feel like normal interactions are out of a sit-com!</p><p>You like your work life and personal life to be separate; you don\u2019t want to think about entertaining your younger siblings while you are working; you don\u2019t want to know what the next door neighbor did to their cat. You need your work space. With freelancing, since there is no regularity in the working hours and you don\u2019t have an office to go to; your room becomes your office. You cannot stop your mother from coming in and telling you to get bread for tomorrow\u2019s breakfast. Neither can you do anything if she doesn\u2019t believe you are actually working and not just \u2018sitting at your laptop and chatting with your friends.\u2019 You will be missing the cubicle at your job before long!</p><p>You wouldn\u2019t like to take your laptop everywhere with you to do work on it. As a freelancer, your laptop will not only be an integral part of your work life, but you will have to respond to your client\u2019s demands on your phone if necessary, who expect you to be available to cater to their questions and edit the work you submitted if required. Freelancers are on call 24/7 and you will have to sit in front of your laptop for multiple hours; working and if not that, be reachable on your phone. In short, you might as well bid your plans of binge watching a TV show on your laptop good bye!</p><p>You are easily distracted. Since freelancing is a one-man (or woman) show, you are the one in-charge of your success and while it is far easier to pat yourself on the back at a job well done than punishing yourself at a mistake (the heart always forgives), the fact remains that you have to prioritize and reach deadlines. If you are easily distracted by the door bell ringing or you cannot go an hour without checking your profile at the social networking sites or a deadline seems more like noose around your neck, freelancing is not for you.</p><p>You are not good at handling it. Freelancing doesn\u2019t bring a consistent flow of income \u2013 sometimes you will have multiple projects at hand, sometimes you will be sitting idle. You will need a systematic saving plan in order to manage your spending. Not only this, you will have to live without the benefits of a job; no paid leaves, no medical insurance, no bonuses\u2026That\u2019s right, you will need to curb those urges for shopping because you might need the money for an unexpected dentist check up! Nobody likes going to the dentist, but now you have to worry about paying the dentist too \u2013 oh, the horror.</p><p>So add this to your existing knowledge about freelancing: it is not easy. Be prepared to search for the work, do the work at any time of the day, and know that any attempts to separate your work life from your personal life are futile. In case of a job, everyone knows specifically what you do. When you are a freelancer, you will spend a lifetime making people understand that what you do is actually a \u2018real job\u2019 and that every time you open your laptop, it\u2019s not to do \u2018<em>frandship\u2019</em> with strangers on Facebook!</p>", "title": [" 5 Reasons Freelancing Might NOT Be The Right Choice For You "], "author": ["Laraib Qureshi"]},

The new system was announced at the beginning of this year.</p><p>Since Friday, the Excise and Taxation Department has begun the issuance of the new smart Vehicle Registration Cards (VRC). The cards will include details for both, the vehicle and the owner. It is the first time that a smartcard system has been introduced that replaces the existing registration book system. Started in January, the system was developed in collaboration with the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA).</p><p>Just like the new Smart NICs, these smart VRCs have an embedded chip similar to sim module. These cards state essential data like the details for the vehicle including its registration number and chassis number, and details regarding the owner of the vehicle including his/her name, NIC number. While the cards list plenty of details on the outside, the chip is capable of storing other relevant and important information regarding the vehicle and its owner.</p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-75434 aligncenter\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/021.jpg\" alt=\"vehicle registration card pakistan\"></p><p>The authority states that these smart cards provide additional security as stored data is safe from unauthorised access and prevents common tampering methods. Though, there has been no mention of the security protocols which have been implemented to make the stored data secure. Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Capt.(r) Mushtaq Ahmed said that \u201cThe basic objective of the project is to convert the decades-old system into a modern one, as is practiced internationally\u201d.</p><p>NADRA has played a big part in the introduction of these smart cards. The smart cards were proposed by DC Mushtaq Ahmed and Director Excise and Taxation Noman Yousuf. The system had been under development for quite a long time. The system was proposed to the Excise and Taxation department 10 months ago and was scheduled to be implemented in May but some delays prevented the launch up until now.</p><p>Issuance of new cards will be charged at Rs 1,450. Both, new and converted cards will be charged at the same rate. In case, that a card owner loses a card\u2019s possession, it will be immediately blocked at the user\u2019s complaint. The Excise department currently lists 850,000 vehicles. The DC said that theory department will convert old books to the new smart cards based on user requests.

Even with the recent Metro projects in major cities in the country, our transport infrastructure is still woefully unprepared for the surge in automobiles and population. Even concerted efforts will take time to address the issues so in the mean time, all that can be done is making sure we are making the most efficient use of our time and resources.</p><p>That\u2019s where Travly comes in. The aim of this startup is to empower commuters and to increase the reach of urban transport by spreading information about public transport. It was already well on its way to becoming an information hub but now, it has taken on a far more ambitious route: becoming the Uber of Pakistan.</p><p>Getting to this point has been part of an evolution process. Travly launched back in 2013 when it was incubated at Plan9, Pakistan\u2019s largest tech invubator. Localized to Lahore, it allowed travelers to plan a route from given a point to another using only the bus system. Later, Travly joined the PlanX tech accelerator. It was there that the startup collaborated with the Lahore Transport Company (LTC) to <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/06/18/lahore-gets-android-app-to-help-commuters-find-and-plan-bus-trips/\" target=\"_blank\">digitize the bus routes of entire city of Lahore</a>.</p><p>Now, it\u2019s all set to introduce Tuk Tuk (Rickshaw) services in Lahore starting from today. Much like a certain Uber, users will be able to get rickshaws at their doorsteps at the click of a button. It is not going to be limited to just that though.</p><p>Shahmir Khan, co-founder and CEO of Travly, tells ProPakistani:</p><p>With services like these, it\u2019s all about aggressive expansion. It\u2019s a market segment where being first means nothing if you can\u2019t get people using it fast enough. That\u2019s why Travly plans to expand operations in Lahore for three months and then head towards Islamabad and Karachi.</p><p>A very important point when it comes to Pakistan is safety. We\u2019ve all seen Uber under fire for incidents with drivers and any service that tries to replicate the model needs to deal with it better than they usually do.</p><p>What\u2019s the vetting process? How would you handle complaints? Those are the the questions we put to Shahmir.</p><p>Travly will monetize their services by deducting a small percentage of all fares. Speaking more about pricing strategy, Shahmir says:</p><p>Pakistanis are a thrifty bunch so of course pricing matters. Thankfully, Travly is well aware of that fact.</p><p>All in all, Travly\u2019s Tuk Tuk service is exciting. There has been talk of an Uber for Pakistan for a while now but we haven\u2019t seen much action apart from this team of six which also includes Faisal Sherjan, an industry veteran who has co-founded Patari and BookMe while serving as a Chief Strategy Officer for many more.</p><p>Travly also adds to the growing list of automobile related startups in Pakistan. Contrary to most startups that focus on volume and then revenues, the likes of <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/09/28/autogenie-pk-closes-100000-investment-from-pakwheels/\" target=\"_blank\">AutoGenie</a> and others have a monetization strategy from the very start and that\u2019s something you don\u2019t see often enough.</p><p>We wish the team at Travly the best of luck and eagerly await the launch of their services in Islamabad!</p>", "title": [" Travly Brings Rickshaw Services to Lahore to Lay Foundations for a Pakistani Uber "], "author": ["Syed Talal"]},

This QoS Survey was conducted in just four cities \u2014 out of more than 250 cities where 3G services are available \u2014 and not to be mentioned it was first QoS survey that PTA conducted in years.</p><p>While we appreciate PTA\u2019s efforts for evaluating\u00a0Quality of Service of telecom operators, experts believe that\u00a0PTA\u2019s current methodology of evaluating QoS can be bettered\u00a0by incorporating simple yet more effective modern-age tools.</p><p>PTA currently conducts drive tests through which various KPIs for quality of services are determined. These drive tests are conducted on specific days (usually once in an year or two or more) and on specific routes only where special equipment is used to calculate KPIs to determine quality of service for cellular operators.</p><p>These routes are selected randomly (we are assuming this as PTA didn\u2019t respond to our request of sharing the methodology through which\u00a0these routes are selected) and\u00a0one will agree that\u00a0one operator may get advantage in 3G/4G speeds\u00a0at a\u00a0particular location as compared to others.</p><p>It must be noted that quality of 3G and 4G services depend on number of subscribers on a cell site, distance from a cell site and various other factors.</p><p>Meaning that a\u00a0random location might be nearer to a cell site of one operator as compared to others\u2019, or number of subscribers\u00a0of\u00a0one operator might\u00a0be lesser at a random location as compared to subscribers\u00a0of other operators, and hence\u00a0one operator may get undue advantage over others through such random selection of routes.</p><p>For those who don\u2019t know, PTA uses NEMO Invex 7 QoS equipment for measuring QoS of operators. This\u00a0equipment is manufactured by \u201cAnite\u201d, a Finland based firm that sells one testing unit\u00a0for several million rupees.</p><p>While we agree that the devices used by PTA for QoS survey\u00a0is\u00a0industry best but the amount and type of data that PTA gathered for\u00a0QoS surveys\u00a0can easily be obtained through simple web and mobile based apps.</p><p>Simple Android and iOS speed test apps can not only get PTA the download speeds of 3G / 4G network operators, but also GPS co-ordinates of the users, operator\u00a0name,\u00a0signal\u00a0strength, mobile type, OS version and various other information that they can grab to find out the\u00a0Quality of Service and as well as\u00a0Quality of Experience for end users from all across Pakistan.</p><p>PTA\u00a0can get such speed-test app developed from a local firm and ask users across Pakistan to use the official\u00a0app for their speed tests, and this way they won\u2019t only get real-time\u00a0speeds of 3G/4G operators but also can save repetitive cost of\u00a0doing drive tests.</p><p>This way, PTA can keep an eye on QoS on real-time and 24/7\u00a0basis to\u00a0find out if there are any issues for any of the operator in any area of Pakistan.</p><p>Moreover, by incorporating speed-test app data for QoS survey, the sample size will increase by over hundred folds if not more, to get the true picture of what QoS telcos are offering.</p><p>Additionally, they will also get speed data of WiMAX operators, fiber optic players, EvDO operators and all sorts of other ISPs operating in Pakistan, hence more\u00a0ability to keep a watch on how\u00a0other network providers are doing with\u00a0quality they offer to customers.</p><p>And if PTA thinks that getting an app developed and then pushing consumers\u00a0to use it is hard, they can simply buy data from Ookla \u2014 the parent company of speedtest.net \u2014 to get all\u00a0such data to evaluate QoS of telecom operators.</p><p>But getting an in-house app will\u00a0definitely be more economic, effective and accurate by any means.</p><p>With in-house apps, PTA can also ask users feedback on quality of experience for\u00a0their respective\u00a0networks. This is something that PTA currently doesn\u2019t evaluate.</p><p>With polls and scientific surveys, that can be added in the app as a separate function or section, can give PTA an accurate measurement of quality of user experience on networks and hence more authoritative data can be collected about how users\u00a0are feeling about the services that they are using.</p><p>Earlier this year Zong had proposed the regulator\u00a0to ensure\u00a0telecom operators\u2019 quality of service through OSS monitoring.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/05/14/zong-proposes-pta-to-determine-telcos-qos-through-oss-monitoring/\" target=\"_blank\">Zong Proposes PTA to Determine Telcos\u2019 QoS through OSS Monitoring</a></strong></em></p><p>For those who don\u2019t know, each operator has designated OSS solutions through which they\u00a0monitor and maintain networks in real-time for any\u00a0technical or procedural issues.</p><p>After getting an official speed-test app for Pakistani users, down the line, PTA can also fetch network data through OSS monitoring, in real time and 24/7, to see how operators are doing with the quality.</p><p>This way they can also keep an eye on various\u00a0KPIs including:</p>", "title": [" Should PTA Adopt Web and App Based QoS Surveys for 3G and 4G Networks?

However, in the case of other MMS applications such as Google Hangouts, the victim doesn\u2019t even need to open the message or watch the attached video in order for the hack to be activated. The device will automatically process all media attachments in incoming Hangouts messages and, in turn, parse the attack code.</p><p>According to Drake, under these dangerous circumstances, a hacker could quickly gain control over the device through remote code execution without any intervention from the victim. Even if they were to discover something fishy, the video would have already made its way into the phone\u2019s Gallery app and there would be little the victim could do in order to protect their personal data. The hacker could also delete the message once the exploit is activated, leaving no trace of the malicious content.</p><p>Stagefright is the multimedia playback tool behind the automatic processing, playback and recording of multimedia files on Android devices. This framework is the culprit that makes it possible for remote code execution to be triggered once a message is received through MMS apps such as Google Hangouts. Drake warned that nearly every app that handles media files on the Android OS makes use of the Stagefright library in one way or another, essentially leaving devices prone to what are said to be the worst Android flaws ever.</p><p>According to Drake, the vulnerabilities have existed in the Google OS since version 2.2. Moreover, devices running Android versions prior to Jelly Bean (4.2) are at under greater threat, as previous versions of the OS don\u2019t feature the exploit mitigations that were built into more recent versions.</p><p>In an effort to put an end to these vulnerabilities, Google has successfully patched its internal code branches.

{"date": ["Sep 14, 2015"], "text": "<p>The newly imposed of Minimum Tax of 8% on services poses a grave threat to the existence of the Services Sector in Pakistan. Previously, withholding tax (WHT) of 8% was deductible by all corporate withholding agents when making payments against the procurement of services. The amounts deducted were considered as Advanced Income Tax payments which may be all offset or claimed back against the final Corporate Income Tax liability of the service provider.</p><p>The Government has now changed the law so that the 8% deduction still applicable on payments to service providers is now to be considered as a Minimum Tax. This is a \u2018revenue tax\u2019 or \u2018turnover tax\u2019 to be imposed regardless of the whether the service provider is profitable or loss-making in the year. In fact the effective result of this new policy will be a Minimum Tax of approximately 9.5% as General Sales Tax amounts collected by service providers will be also be subject to Minimum Tax (see Note A below).</p><p>For reasons described below we believe that the imposition of such Minimum Tax will lead to the disastrous effects on the Services industry and on the economy at large.</p><p>It is near impossible to operate many services business (or arguably any kind of business) with a Minimum Tax rate of 9.5%. There are a huge number of businesses in the Services Sector which operate at very low margins (e.g. manpower outsourcing, 3PL companies, Security Services Providers, freight forwarding, cargo agents, customer handlers, BPO, ITES etc.). Before tax profit margins in such business typically range between 3 to 8 %. Minimum Tax of 9.5% effectively means payment of more than 100% of profits in taxes and thus making these businesses unviable (see Note B below for illustration). Hence, if this matter is not addressed immediately it will lead to shutdown of a number of companies causing significant unemployment in the country.</p><p>Minimum Tax becomes a major disincentive towards local entrepreneurship and foreign direct investment in the country. Businesses, especially in the services sector, typically operate below break-even for the first few years of establishment. Adding a tax of 9.5% of turnover makes it impossible to develop a viable business plan. Such an imposing disincentive towards investment in the Services Sector will invariably result in reduction in entrepreneurship, local investment and FDI. It is in our knowledge that many new investments have been put on hold or scrapped in the last two months (since the imposition of minimum tax) leading to irreparable loss to the economy. Without entrepreneurship and new investment, the economy will not be able to produce new jobs for the youth and thus will bring about large scale social disruption in the country.</p><p>In both cases above (i.e. low margin service providers and new investments/ enterprise) Minimum Tax is greater than profits. Therefore, businesses are required to pay this amount from existing capital or induct new capital to pay such taxes. By definition this is no longer a tax but an expropriation of capital. Expropriation of capital is strictly against the provisions of sector 4 of the Constitution of Pakistan and also illegal as provided by established precedent of law in Pakistan. Hence the imposition of Minimum Tax is both oppressive and illegal.</p><p>According to the Economic Survey of Pakistan (2014-15), the Services Sector represented 59% of the GDP of the country. In addition to this, the share of the Services Sector of the economy has been growing over the past decade and it is a common view that Pakistan\u2019s future success is most dependent on the growth of the Services Sector. Minimum Tax of 8% is now imposed on the Services Sector whereas Minimum Tax for all others is limited to 1%. Such a discriminatory measure against the sector will discourage the investment and expansion in this sector and will ultimately lead to lower growth rates of Pakistan\u2019s economy in future years.</p><p>This government is rapidly increasing its use of indirect taxes at the federal as well as provincial levels. Indirect taxes are those collected upon transactions (payment or receipt) rather than profit or real income. Indirect taxes are by definition indiscriminate and regressive. For example, in the case of this Minimum Tax, all services companies are required to pay up to 9.5% of revenue regardless of the profit margins (for loss making companies it would be unbearable).</p><p>In contrast, the norms of progressive taxation dictate that taxes should be imposed based on the capacity of the taxpayer. We are in a situation where indirect taxes are being levied on all possible transactions and aspects of life without any thought as to their collective impact on the taxpayer. They are both haphazard and onerous. This has led to an environment where the cost and complexity of compliance is now simply unbearable for companies and therefore more businesses are being pushed to the undocumented spectrum leading to the rapid expansion of the black economy (see Note C below for an analysis of impact of indirect taxation on the tax-net in Pakistan).</p><p>Notwithstanding the destructive effect of 9.5% minimum tax, we also point to the sudden and arbitrary method of its application. In the UK when changes in the tax policy or rates are planned they are announced years in advance and then applied gradually over a period of up to 3 to 5 years (e.g. 1% per year). In this case, a new tax of 8% of revenue was imposed with just one day\u2019s notice.</p><p>This means that the operating model of services companies was fundamentally altered overnight leaving no time whatsoever for adjustment to the new regime. Such sudden shifts in tax policy send a very negative signal to investors, both local and international. They raise grave concerns over the stability and continuity of our policy. This matter needs immediate rectification but even if and after this is done so, it has already put forward a new type of risk of doing business in Pakistan (i.e. instability of tax policy).</p><p>There are also grave procedural concerns in the method in which Minimum Tax was imposed. In the Budget speech of 5 June 2015, no proposal to introduce minimum tax was mentioned. If this was done so, the industry would have been provided a narrow window of 3 to 4 weeks to reach out to the Government and jointly revisit the implications \u2013 this is a normal practice in the annual budgetary cycle. Instead, the introduction of Minimum Tax was informed to the industry on the same day as the approval of the Finance Act 2015 by the President of Pakistan. This points towards a complete breakdown of transparency and consensus in policy development of the Government.</p><p>As a result of this existential threat to the services sector, many companies and sub-sectors will be moving towards severe industrial action in the coming days and weeks. It is pertinent to note that Freight Forwarders, Cargo Agents and Custom Agents have already sounded their intention to completely shut down their businesses until such time that relief is granted. Notices have been sent to the highest quarters in the Government machinery.</p><p>Such Industrial Action in these sub-sectors will most definitely lead to severe blockages in the supply chains including the ports of the country. These Services Sector businesses no other choice as the Minimum Tax imposition has completely invalidated their business model and it is no longer possible for them to continue operations. We fear that if actions are not taken swiftly, the damage caused by these strikes will have deep and lasting adverse effect on the national economy.</p><p>Information Technology Services (ITS) and Information Technology Enable Services (ITES) represents one of the fast growing sectors in the country. According to the leading players in these sectors, ITS services supplied to local clients attract a margin around 8-10% of revenue where as ITES services attract 4-6%. In this light, the ITS/ITES sectors will simply not be able to survive leading to significant unemployment. ITS and ITES are sectors which can open new vistas of growth for the country through innovation. Minimum Tax will permanently shut down such avenues of future potential for the country.</p><p>Several meetings and conversations have taken place with the Ministries of Finance/ FBR and the Services Sector since 1st July. In the first few meetings, high-ranking officials at the FBR empathized and agreed with the point of view of the industry and even promised relief for the same in August. However, no such relief has been provided as yet and it is clear that the government has no intent in addressing the issue. The Services Sector is moving towards legal action in large numbers. Two petitions have already been filed in the Lahore High Court by two companies. We are expecting at least 25 more petitions over the next two weeks in both the LHC and the SHC. Furthermore, this number will rapidly rise until such time that relief is granted.</p><p>In addition to all of the above, the leadership of companies in the Services Sector has spent highly inordinate amounts of time in addressing this matter and this will likely continue until such time that relief is granted. Such pervasive focus on this has had and will continue to have adverse impact on the results of the companies. Instead of putting forth policy which supports innovation and growth in the services sector, the government is introducing obstacles and oppressive/ extortionist measures. It would appear that the message to investors is clear \u2013 that they should pack-up and go to other places to do business.</p><p>The Minimum Tax is unjust, counter-intuitive, against the principle of free market and contrary to practices of the better marketplaces in the world. Furthermore, it will have disastrous effects on the development of services, technology and innovation in the country rendering many business models unviable and thereby causing huge contraction in unemployment in these sectors. With this in mind, we plead that it be reversed from the Finance Act 2015 at the earliest possible opportunity.</p><p><b>A</b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minimum Tax is to be applied to 8% of gross consideration paid to the service provider. Gross consideration is defined to be inclusive of General Sales Tax (GST). The prevailing GST rate for some services (e.g. Call Center Outsourcing) is 19.5% and 8% Min Tax would be charged to 19.5% GST (equaling 1.56%).

When it does happen though, it\u2019s a moment of relief mixed with excitement. It\u2019s when you realize all your hard work won\u2019t go to waste and someone believes in your vision enough to put in a significant amount of money.</p><p>However, the competitive nature of funding is exactly what brings about a very significant issue: overvaluation. More money is not always good and getting greedy or caught up in your own hype might end up dealing the death blow to your business. Here is why.</p><p>You don\u2019t secure funding just once. It\u2019s a process. You have seed funding to get the startup going and Series A, B, C and onwards as you scale your product and then your business. If you accept a larger amount of funding right from the beginning, you are going to have a much harder time raising a larger amount in the next rounds. The benchmarks will have to be higher, the performance better and you investors might realize the initial funding overvalued the startup.</p><p>On the other hand, if you are conservative and only ask for what you actually need, investors will realize you have a steady head on your shoulders and you aren\u2019t swayed by hype. So in short, start conservatively and scale according to need. Don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew.</p><p>Often, I see startups making the mistake of treating investors like an ATM. They\u2019re not. It\u2019s their hard earned cash and deciding where to spend it is what they do for a living. In that sense, they have a significantly better idea of your valuation. If you ask for more than what they think you are worth, you run the risk of appearing incompetent.</p><p>It shows you don\u2019t know how to value your own product and are affected by your personal stake in the startup. It\u2019s good to believe that your product is awesome but you need to wear an objective pair of glasses and see things from an investors point of view. The last thing you need is a major shareholder making a negative mental note to themselves because of your funding pitch.</p><p>Let\u2019s say you are looking for 5 million rupees. Most investors you\u2019ve met with only commit to around 2.5 million. But then you find this unicorn who is willing to write a blank cheque. Instead of rushing to the bank, you should think about why. Often, such investors have a different vision of where your startup should go. You can\u2019t ignore or disregard a majority shareholder so finding someone who agrees with your market strategy, scaling and revenue models is absolutely critical.</p><p>The headaches of an investor who wants to steer your startup in another direction are too many to list. It simply undermines your authority and takes away the control you need in order to make the business flourish. People don\u2019t found startups to get rich, they get into the whole scene to make a difference. And if you have to work with someone who disagrees on how to go about that, it\u2019s hell.

You woke up late and were in a hurry. You forgot your documents at home. You thought you could get through before the traffic light turned red. Or maybe it was some imbecile\u00a0who couldn\u2019t wait his turn at the checkpoint, bumped into your car and is now eating your head off.</p><p>Anyways, the end result is a challan. Paying off those can be a pain, specially during work days. Auto Genie offers a traffic ticket service for exactly these moments. They pay the bank, get your documents and hand them over to you after you pay a service charge. Simple.</p><p>That\u2019s not all.

The service will soon begin offering certifications to mechanics and introduce a portal for the sale of pre-owned cars. In addition, highly rated workshops and auto-part vendors will be part of a flagship initiative.</p><p>While consumer response has been very good, some corporate names have also been very interested in getting service quotes for their car pools.</p><p>Magic! As someone who would rather play Civilization 5\u00a0instead of spending time cleaning up the car, I am hoping Auto Genie expands to Islamabad as soon as possible. Having talked with Hamza about\u00a0the long term vision of the project and hearing\u00a0the testimonials, I am convinced Auto Genie has a bright future.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.autogenie.pk/\" target=\"_blank\">You can access Auto Genie here</a></p>", "title": [" Auto Genie: Say Goodbye to the Hassle of Keeping a Car "], "author": ["Syed Talal"]},

The design is said to be more manageable than its predecessor. The leaked renderings show a similar design language to the company\u2019s P8 smartphone, which is understandable. Specs can be subjected to change though so do take them with a pinch of salt.</p><p>The phone is rumoured to get released in the second half of 2015, possibly in November or around Christmas.

LG, the company behind the Nexus 5 has reportedly geared up to produce a 5.2\u201d smartphone based on that device, understandable given its immense popularity and alluring price. More than one Nexus phone releases seems like a possibility, then. Its successor the Motorola-built Nexus 6 meanwhile, was not quite nearly as successful thanks to a combination of uncharacteristically-high price and a polarizing design.</p><p>In that scenario, another possibility could be a high-end Nexus release from LG and a mid-range release from the Chinese. Or the other way round.</p><p>This partnership can bring huge benefits to both Google and Huawei. For the former, this will be yet another step in the quest to bring the Play Store and related services to the People\u2019s Republic.

That\u2019s an adage as old as rusty as any\u00a0and with the rise of\u00a0clickbait, viral videos and fabricated stories to drive traffic, has never held truer.</p><p>Recently, a video on DailyMotion had been making the rounds. In it, two men \u2018reveal\u2019 the real reason why there are so many leaked videos from smartphones\u00a0these days. You see, all batteries on Samsung devices have a chip on them. A spy chip, if you will. And that constantly uploads all your personal information including videos to the internet to be viewed by anybody. Devious, eh? That\u2019s why a lot of people have taken to opening up the batteries of their Samsung devices and throwing away these evil chips (which also apparently are the cause of your phone getting hot). Phew. Privacy disaster averted!\u2026right?</p><p>Not really.\u00a0What a number of people actually did was destroy the NFC chips in their smartphones which \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 come attached to the battery (for most modern smartphones). If you aren\u2019t familiar with NFC, here is a short primer.</p><p>NFC, which stands for Near Field Communication, is an evolution of RFID. It\u2019s used to transfer data between two devices held in close proximity (a few centimeters).\u00a0NFC tags have already seen a wide variety of applications like triggering specific profiles when you enter your home or office\u00a0to\u00a0eliminating the need for customers to enter a WiFi password in shops.</p><p>More importantly, NFC is\u00a0being hailed as the future of payments. The next trend is to eliminate plastic cards altogether and use your smartphone for payments. NFC is the key technology in making that happen. We could go on but let\u2019s save that for another day and just agree that NFC chips most certainly aren\u2019t spy chips.</p><p>Which brings us back to these buffoons who have already racked up 75,000 views on their video.</p><p>We cannot stress the importance of fact checking everything you read or listen or watch on the internet. This time it was two trolls who made your NFC chip useless. Next time, it could be something much more dangerous. There are people out there who get off on making others miserable, and the gullible among us are a target and a great source of amusement for them.</p><p>So if you ever read something that sounds strange, just ask around before you do something you can\u2019t take back.

The policy makers are looking to encourage motorcyclists who\u2019ve wanted to switch their vehicles with a small car, but haven\u2019t been able to do so thus far due to the rising car prices.

Three and a half years later, he joined Y Combinator as a full time partner.</p><p>Y Combinator is an interesting mix between a venture fund, fertile learning grounds and a startup incubator. That mix clearly works since the total worth of the 900 startups that\u2019ve already graduated from the program is around $65 billion.

{"date": ["Sep 14, 2015"], "text": "<p>The government of Pakistan recently completed the Metro bus project in Islamabad. Is it a success? There have been mixed views.</p><p>They range from people criticizing the effort and substantiating their critique with pictures of the project being flooded in rainy season to praise for the effort contributing to economy\u2019s progress regardless of the drawbacks. This is not the only project in Pakistan which has been criticized either on irrational or reasonable grounds and it is true for projects in every field, not just infrastructure.</p><p>Development and telecom sectors have faced their fair share of criticism. What if there was a specialized group of people who were to find solutions to specific problems? People from around the world learned in the specialized field, dedicated to solve one problem.</p><p>The questions that arise are: Why is there a weak link even existing, waiting to be attacked upon? Why the projects are not effectively planned? Why is there a deficiency in long term thinking? The answer lies in the absence of a research culture in Pakistan: we don\u2019t think. We don\u2019t analyze. We simply act.</p><p>One might argue that there is no time to do research and a detailed analysis when undertaking a project. This is why there is a dire need of independent research organizations i.e. think tanks in Pakistan \u2013 to investigate, to scrutinize thereby providing direction, vision and most importantly sustainability to all sectors of the country.</p><p>Leading global economies are governed by think tanks. One team of experts (some imported from other countries) to ensure that there are viable solutions to concurrent problems and their results will be realistically be achieved within a certain period of time.</p><p>Pakistan lacks think tanks in every field; there are no specific organizations to determine and guide on how to go about things. They are needed to breathe air into the intellectually disabled and short sighted business culture of the country: to act as a bridge between the leadership of these sectors and the most sustainable practical solution available.</p><p>For example, how amazing would it be if there were intellectuals who were thinking about eliminating energy issues from Pakistan, and they were experts from energy sector with global exposure, working to advise government or private companies on ways to generate or conserve energy. The knowledge produced by these intellectuals would come in handy for not only new projects but to make the existing ones more sustainable.</p><p>These think tanks could be funded by the government or work on contract based funding, either way, they need to exist.</p><p>In case of the Telecom sector, the only constant is change. The gigantic leaps in technology have to be followed by advancements in telecom. Unfortunately, Pakistani Telecom industry doesn\u2019t have any thinkers to advise the companies on how to adapt to this change. There is nobody to counsel them on how convert opportunities into profits, adapt to the changing dynamics of the market or where possible, change the dynamics of the market themselves. This is where think tanks will prove to be useful; to give advice and counsel.</p><p>Furthermore, their services could be acquired to do research and write papers on dealing with decreasing ARPUs (average revenue per user) and increasing cost; the information then being used to conduct an analysis on how to increase profits. This is not the only research having a substantial importance in this sector.</p><p>Research on market, industry trends, technologies, business intelligence, associations and competition is just as equally important. Most telecom companies don\u2019t have the human resource which could be doubled as research experts and therefore most of these areas are ignored when a new project is launched. This results in an imitative behavior, similar products and the industry\u2019s progress being hindered.</p><p>Therefore, think tanks are needed not only to fill the gaps pin pointing the weaknesses of projects in all sectors of the country; they are also required to activate a research culture which fertilizes the development and initiatives in these fields.</p><p>So that rather than acting on something and realizing that it was a mistake, we could use think tanks to research, strategize and then act \u2013 not leaving any room for an oversight. They will, above all, assist in creating a culture which enhances our country\u2019s potential rather than curbing it.</p>", "title": [" The Dire Need for Think Tanks in Pakistan "], "author": ["Laraib Qureshi"]},

Operational in Pakistan for the past three years through that collaboration, Transpay is looking to dig deeper into the lucrative local freelancing market.</p><p class=\"gmail_default\">The timing seems astute. We\u2019ve previously talked about how freelancing is a popular revenue stream for many developers, designers and content creators in Pakistan and its popularity is only increasing. This year, Pakistani freelancers could hit the $1 billion dollars revenue mark and that\u2019s turned a few heads.</p><p class=\"gmail_default\">However, there are challenges associated with freelancing. Pakistanis often don\u2019t get equal footing on many platforms when it comes to payments. Withdrawals sometimes get very tricky and there\u2019s a certain hesitancy when it comes to making freelancing a full time gig. That is where Transpay is hoping to help.</p><p class=\"gmail_default\">A division of Transfast Remittance LLC. Transpay is a cross border payments platform with the world\u2019s largest, independent payment network worldwide. The platform uses end-to-end technology to enable instant transfers across a global proprietary network. Funds are delivered in the recipient\u2019s local currency.</p><p class=\"gmail_default\">ProPakistani got in touch with Mohsin Mehmood, the Transpay country manager for Pakistan, and asked him more about the service he represents. Here\u2019s what he had to say:</p><p>Mohsin is a former freelancer himself and is passionate about making the payments part of freelancing as hassle free as possible. The way he describes his experience and requirements from a payments solution as a freelancer will ring true for a lot of you out there. He says:</p><p class=\"gmail_default\">Transpay is billed as a simple, fast and secure end to end solution that\u2019s connected to your banks. On Upwork, you just enter simple information about your bank account and SWIFT code and that\u2019s pretty much it.</p><p class=\"gmail_default\">Most of the times funds are transferred within the same day, however it may take up to 3 business days.</p><p class=\"gmail_default\">More importantly, Transpay has local help available in Pakistan, in case you have questions or suggestions. They are also setting up a forum for easier access. In case you have any questions or need help, you can contact Mohsin directly via email at <span class=\"il\">mohsin</span>.muzaffer@transpay.<wbr></wbr>global.</p><p class=\"gmail_default\">Transpay is looking to establish a long standing relation with freelancers and business owners in Pakistan. Among other plans in the pipeline is collaboration with other major freelancing platforms to offer their payment service.</p><p>In addition, Transpay is also offering cash pick up point concept for freelancers. Those who don\u2019t have bank accounts will be able to choose to receive their payments on cash pick up points.</p><p>If you don\u2019t use Upwork, Transpay can still be used seperately albeit it\u2019s in a <a href=\"https://www.transpay.global/Receiver/Receiver\" target=\"_blank\">beta invitation phase right now</a>.

Endless hours spent at the office? Spending half the day being drained of energy and losing the will to enjoy anything? Too much pressure?</p><p>The word is subject to many different interpretations. However, if majority of the people associate their job with negative implications, Pakistani work culture is in dire need of change.</p><p>The country\u2019s social problems play their part in establishment of unsuitable work conditions. With the steady population increase, the unemployment rate of the country is on the rise. The employees are easily replaceable and exploitation is common. As a result, the impact of the office norms on the employee is ignored in Pakistan. There is heavy workload, unsuitable office environments, long working hours, low wages and even gender discrimination. As a result, employees find it hard to be productive at work.</p><p>Money. Profit. Success. Glory.</p><p>These goals drive the businesses in Pakistan. Nobody stops to pay attention to what matters: productive culture, motivated workforce, investment in employee skills and most importantly, building trust. Nobody stops to think that if these were the core values of the work culture, profits and success will automatically follow.</p><p>Let\u2019s take the example of working hours. Is working 40 hours (or more) every week really achieving productivity? Swedish government certainly doesn\u2019t think so. Experimentation with a six hour workday has started in Gothenburg, Sweden. Officials believe that this will lead to higher productivity per hour and better mental health of workers.</p><p>Due to last a year, the experiment has already attracted attention across Scandinavia. Europe is not far behind in these developments. Experiments on the connection between risks of heart disease and long working hours were conducted by scientists at University College London. The results showed that people who <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/08/24/all-work-and-no-play-increases-your-chances-of-heart-disease-by-33/\" target=\"_blank\">spend more time at office have a greater risk of contracting heart disease and stroke</a>.</p><p>There\u2019s\u00a0a large body of research that suggests that regardless of any reasons for working long hours, overwork\u00a0is not beneficial. The Finnish Institute of Occupational Health has found that it leads to depression, diabetes, impaired memory and sleep. In Pakistan, companies don\u2019t even offer medical insurance because of lack of proper laws \u2013 there is no accountability to ensure the employees are mentally and physically fit.</p><p>Extensive working hours is only the tip of the iceberg of problems that our work culture faces. It doesn\u2019t create a facilitating environment for women to reach their potential because of gender discrimination and low wages. According to a recent online poll, 58% of the Pakistani professionals feel there is gender discrimination in their workplace.</p><p>Then, the typical authoritative <em>danda</em> norm in most places means bosses don\u2019t like to relinquish control and there is no space for discussion. In fact, you cannot even give your boss your opinion for fear of losing your job! The result? Unhappy employees who don\u2019t take ownership of their work because they are not empowered or motivated to do so. They don\u2019t trust their employers. Not only this, since there is no conscious effort to impart skills to the workers, there is no knowledge seeking or innovation.</p><p>Think of a company as a machine. If the boss considers some parts not worth oiling, these parts will ultimately stop contributing to the overall efficiency. Not only will they become useless but they will not think of themselves an important part of the final output. The machine will run down one day.</p><p>So making employees an integral part of the organization is essential. This can be done through small gestures like more empowering tasks, skill enhancement trainings, equity, profit sharing and a discussion oriented culture. A work culture that discourages overwork motivates employees and builds democratic relationships, can go a long way to make the business a success.</p><p>There is no need to force employees into working.

According to Microsoft, its predecessor has been selling about 100 units per minute since 2013.</p><p>The new Nokia 105 comes with several improvements over its previous generation sibling. For starters, it offers an extended phonebook capacity, which allows the phone to store up to 2,000 contacts. In addition, it comes with enhanced audio for improved voice clarity. It also support up to 15-hours of talk time in addition to up to 35 days of standby time, all thanks to its replaceable 800mAh battery.

{"date": ["Sep 14, 2015"], "text": "<p>UC Browser is one of the most used browsers in the world with over 500 million downloads across multiple devices and platforms. The browser has managed to gain major market shares in developing markets where internet networks, whether broadband or mobile, are slower and don\u2019t have coverage over the whole country.</p><p>UC Browser employs cloud technology as the basis for optimizing the user experience when browsing the internet. UC servers handle data compression, cloud acceleration, download resume feature, cloud storage through UDisk integration, real-time Facebook app replacement and much more, all done at the back end. UC browser compress data by up to 85 percent to increase web browsing efficiency.</p><p>UC Browser claims to use cloud optimization and multithreaded downloading to increase file download speeds over Wifi and mobile data. Offline buffering and other such feature promise to improve browsing experience manifold. A third-party company, QualiTest, compared the browsers download features by putting it against some of the most known browsers like Opera Mini and Google Chrome a few months ago. The tests revealed that UC was the fastest browser in the world at the time.</p><p>The team behind UC Browser has managed to develop the browser in such a way that its features are modified according to the region of the user. For example, when it learns that you are in Pakistan, it asks to download the appropriate content. The default homepage apps and speed-dial change to the ones that are mostly used by the local internet users. The browser even displays links to UC\u2019s own cricket news website. UC aims to globalize their browser by providing local content and multiple language support. The browser even optimizes page load times and the whole internet access as a whole.</p><p>Small data packages and lack of data coverage restricts Pakistani users from streaming content and most users prefer to download music, videos and other similar content straight to the device to reduce data usage. UC has optimized its services according to the needs of users of such developing markets.</p><p>UC Browser brings Cloud Downloads, Data Compression and Cloud Boost technologies to mobile browsing which help increase download speeds and improve the overall reliability of downloads.</p><p>UC Browser has enabled its Cloud Download service available for everyone for the past few months. The service allows users to avoid disconnection and interruption problems which cause large file downloads to break before they get completed, something often seen when downloading files from file-sharing websites. Cloud Download is a much more practical solution for markets with slow internet connections.</p><p>It is common to go into out-of-coverage areas when you are out and about and using mobile data. Mobile data is often not fast or stable enough to complete file downloads. The problem is not unseen in most broadband connections. Internet interruptions cause the downloads to be restarted, which in turn causes more mobile data to be used and time wasted re-downloading the files. UC Browser\u2019s Cloud Download service solves these sort of situations allowing even those users to use the service who don\u2019t have a UC account.</p><p>Using the Cloud Download service lets the users download any sort of file straight to UC Browser\u2019s cloud storage. This does not consume any data and the user is not required to interact with the download. The servers manage the download automatically. Users can have their files saved straight to the cloud storage and download it from there without interruptions. Downloads from the cloud storage can be resumed even if the internet connectivity is interrupted. Thus, avoiding restarting or downloading the files all over again.</p><p>Another added benefit of UC Cloud Downloads is that it gives the users flexibility to download their files later whenever it is more convenient and at very high speeds. By creating an account, a user can get their own cloud drive which can be used to store files for downloads across multiple devices or to download them when a more stable connection is available. This is much more beneficial when you have to download large files but don\u2019t want to use mobile data. UC servers can download the files in the background and the user can retrieve them later when they gain access to a Wifi network.</p><p>When users start a download on UC Browser, they are prompted to choose whether to start a regular download or a Cloud Download. When a cloud download is chosen it asks to use the service as a trial allowing the user to download up to three tasks and save them in cloud storage for 7 days. Creating a free account helps in increasing the download storage and gives access to the UC cloud drive, UDisk.</p><p>Another feature of the UC Browser is Cloud Boost. It\u2019s a unique service that modifies web pages, uses advanced download techniques and does a lot of other steps, all happening in the background, to make downloads and web page load times faster. Cloud Boost helps download videos and other files faster than normal downloads.</p><p>The service is turned on by default for mobile data but needs to be turned on manually for WiFi by going to UC Browser\u2019s settings.</p><p>UC Browser offers some extremely useful features and advanced controls to improve a user\u2019s web experience. Downloads are only part of the story, Add-ons and cloud support are major features that make every day browsing a breeze. Whether it is the advanced download optimizations or the multitude of features, UC seems to have its users requirements completely covered.</p>", "title": [" UC Browser Boosts Downloads for the Data Conscious User "], "author": ["Syed Talal"]},

According to Unep, the increase in electronic, municipal, and food waste, as well as discarded chemicals and counterfeit pesticides is having serious repercussions on the global environment and economy.</p><p>Given the conditions in which the waste is dumped, developing countries are losing out on rare and precious resources, such as earth metals, copper and gold.

Or your order got notably late\u00a0because\u00a0of some procedural delays? Or that your order got cancelled altogether due to some system errors?\u00a0If you\u2019ve faced any of these situations, than you are not alone.</p><p>A whole lot of consumers \u2014 who despite all the odds trust Pakistani online shops \u2014 undergo similar\u00a0situations and\u00a0their orders are\u00a0either delayed or are\u00a0never delivered. This can get\u00a0uglier\u00a0if you have paid in advance, such as through credit or debit cards because\u00a0refund can\u00a0take weeks,\u00a0or even months.</p><p><strong>Here is why it all happens:</strong></p><p>Online shops lie. They lie about the items\u00a0they display on their websites. They\u00a0pose\u00a0as if they are Walmart of Pakistan having thousands of items\u00a0mentioned on their websites but in reality they don\u2019t stock anything with them. I know a few stores that don\u2019t stock a single item but their\u00a0web-stores are filled with variety of\u00a0products ranging from dresses to electronics to\u00a0sports and\u00a0medicine.</p><p>These huge looking online-shops\u00a0buy products from open-markets\u00a0only after an order is placed with them. This is how\u00a0they avoid large-scale investments, which is wise, but this whole practice causes delays or cancellations and ultimately these shops earn\u00a0disgruntled customers\u00a0causing serious mistrust among the masses.</p><p>One of my friend\u00a0once ordered a\u00a0\u00a0product\u00a0from Daraz.pk, and paid with a credit card in advance. The order took more than\u00a015 days instead of 4-9 days of\u00a0advertised delivery time, which I believe is a deal breaker. Upon investigation we found out that Daraz actually had to order the product\u00a0from Dubai and it took them over a week to have product with them to finally get it dispatched to\u00a0the\u00a0customer.</p><p>A similar situation arose just\u00a0this week for Abdul Sattar Ansari who\u00a0ordered one split AC (Air Conditioner) that was offered on promotion with 25% discount.\u00a0Instead of getting the delivery of AC, he was instead told by Daraz that the order was cancelled due to a system error and his money (around Rs. 30,000) will be refunded.</p><p>After 15 days of initial payment, Mr. Ansari is still awaiting a refund and matter is reportedly yet not resolved. He is\u00a0planning to sue to company for holding his payment for this long\u00a0for no reason.</p><p>Daraz told me that\u00a0delay in Mr. Ansari\u2019s refund is due to banking procedures and it will be cleared as soon as it will be possible. But\u00a0my real question that why a promotion was put online when Daraz didn\u2019t have\u00a0sufficient inventory went unanswered.</p><p>Daraz said that they are a marketplace and the vendor went out of stock when the promotion went viral. They had ultimately no stock and hence had to\u00a0cancel orders.</p><p>Unfortunately, these incidents aren\u2019t rare and aren\u2019t specific to Daraz only. As I explained above,\u00a0almost every online story tend to display products that they don\u2019t have with them.</p><p>Since online stores have usually thousands of products listed with them on their websites,\u00a0prices of several products go high and\u00a0they find out about hiked prices only after getting the order when they go out to market to buy them.\u00a0Instead of bearing the loss, online-shops\u00a0tend of cancel the order altogether and\u00a0whole exercise of fire-fight between store and customer is repeated.</p><p>Almost every online-store understands this and they know that their deeds have to be corrected but\u00a0to win over competition they aren\u2019t able to straighten their\u00a0acts. In return, an already struggling industry is\u00a0getting hurt and those select people who used to trust online shops are losing their faith too.</p><p>Lying about inventory to win-over the competition\u00a0will one day kill the e-commerce industry altogether and these online shops won\u2019t have any customers to tell a single lie.</p>", "title": [" Online Shops Lie About Their Inventory and This is Killing E-commerce Industry in Pakistan!

The firm also requires exploits for other Apple devices and has a total of $3 million on offer for any flaws that it deems useful. Partial exploits are also included in the offer but will not be subject to the Million Dollar Bounty.</p><p>Jailbreaking is the process of bypassing security in an iOS device to install applications that aren\u2019t offered through Apple\u2019s app store and aren\u2019t authorised. In other words, it allows the ability to gain root access.</p><p>The firm requires an \u201cexclusive, browser-based, and untethered jailbreak for the latest Apple iOS 9 operating system and devices\u201d. Zerodium\u2019s bounty page also states \u201c\u201cEligible submissions must include a full chain of unknown, unpublished, and unreported vulnerabilities/exploits (aka zero-days) which are combined to bypass all iOS 9 exploit mitigations including: ASLR, sandboxes, rootless, code signing, and bootchain\u201d.</p><p>It also wants the exploits not to trigger any alarms in the OS, work reliably and only require visiting a web page or receiving a message. After a hacker has found the exploit they will be required to send a detailed explanation over an encrypted email and would be bound not to tell anyone about any of the vulnerabilities.</p><p>Apple\u2019s iOS was hackable using just a webpage from 2007 to 2011 and users used a popular website for doing so but in recent years the OS has improved in security rendering the old ways useless.</p><p>The jailbreak process will require hackers to chain multiple security loopholes to bypass different OS restrictions and security alarms to gain the highest possible control over the system. While the process of finding security bugs is good if sent to the OEM, it can be very dangerous if used by government agencies or hackers.</p><p>Zerodium is the kind of firm that will acquire these jailbreaks and security loopholes and sell them to governments and their agencies. An iOS9 jailbreak is estimated to sell for around $300,000 when bought by a government agency, defense departments and the tech industry. The need for zero-day exploits by such corporations is easy to guess. There are several other firms like Zerodium who are already hard at work on finding similar loopholes in mainstream devices.</p><p>The bounty will run until the 31st of October and could also finish earlier if their goals are met or if the $3 million amount gets used up for other Apple exploits.</p>", "title": [" Upwards of $3 Million Bounty on Offer for iOS Exploits "], "author": ["Aadil Shadman"]},

{"date": ["Sep 29, 2015"], "text": "<p>When YouTube was being banned from Pakistan, the team of Tune.pk was ready to launch their product in the market. The basic idea was to provide the users with a video sharing platform that is purely Pakistani. As of now Tune.pk is one of the biggest video sharing website not only in Pakistan but also in South-Asia region and is serving millions of videos daily all around the world.</p><p>Tune.pk\u00a0is a\u00a0video sharing\u00a0website where users can upload, watch and share videos. Unregistered users can watch, share and even comment on any video. However registration is required for uploading and rating a video. Tune.pk is available on all digital mediums i-e- iOS, Windows and Android</p><p>Tune.pk started off as a team of two; Jahanzeb Hassan &amp; Arslan Hassan in a small room of their own house. With continuous hard work and dedication they were able to create something that is being used by the entire Pakistani market as of today.</p><p>As it is faced by every startup, Tune.pk also faced a lot of problems after its launch. When it was created, the main focus was to promote music which later was converted to promoting videos. In its pilot phase tune.pk was using 3rd Party Software with a customized style. In October 2007, Tune.pk was taken down by hosting stating it is using 3rd party script illegally. This prompted the team to create something that would solely be their own. And after working tirelessly for a long time, tune.pk was able to strike back in 2012, on the same day that YouTube was facing an existential crisis in Pakistan.</p><p>Even though our country as a whole was mourning YouTube being banned and there was a lot of backlash, Tune.pk stepped up and provided a solution to the problem that was being faced by Pakistanis. Even now, the team actually hopes that the ban is lifted so that they can compete with YouTube in every way possible and prove to everyone that a local product can be at the top of the market.</p><p>Recently, Tune.pk revamped their website design on their 3rd anniversary this year (17th September). The website design has been tweaked to make it more user friendly. The video player has been optimized to make video playing smoother and faster than before. In order to improve video uploading by users, the system has been upgraded and made more efficient.</p><p>A new feature has been added with which the users will be able to get a notification in case of any activity on their shared content. On the mobile front, the apps (Android &amp; iOS) have been updated for better performance. Another thing that\u2019s an important step taken by tune.pk is the addition of white head; this would enable the users to report any bug in the website and they would get a reward in exchange for that.</p><p>Interested to know just how popular Tune.pk is?

While it is not as curved as its predecessor, the Galaxy Note Edge, the Galaxy S6 Edge makes up for it by being bent on both sides. The result is a device that looks and feels unique.</p><p>However, the design changes come at a cost. There is no removable battery and the expandable microSD card slot is gone as well. Is it trade off worth it? Personally, no. But the fact is Samsung got slaughtered last year in sales and revenue. Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi are going global and Apple is running away with the profits. It was about time Samsung rebranded itself as a premium manufacturer and that\u2019s exactly what they have done.</p><p>Both Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge come with 5.1 inch Super AMOLED displays with a resolution of\u00a01440 x 2560 pixels. That comes out to an eye popping 576 pixels per inch. The panels are protected by Gorilla Glass 4\u00a0so they won\u2019t get scratched easily.</p><p>As you might have already known, Samsung dropped Qualcomm as the provider of chipsets for the Galaxy S6 Duo. Instead, they have used their own 14nm Exynos chips which are expected to run cooler and be more efficient. On the storage front, you have the options of 32GB/64GB/128GB.</p><p>Both devices run on the latest Android Lollipop 5.0.2. It wouldn\u2019t be a Samsung handset without TouchWiz so of course you get that too. The company has focused on cutting down the bloatware that ships with the device and it shows. Only 2 default Samsung apps come bundled with the S6.</p><p>Both the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Edge come with 16MP cameras with optical image stabilization. They can also shoot video upto 2160p at 30fps while 1080p video can be shot at 60fps. \u00a0At the front, you get a 5MP camera capable of 1080p video at 30fps.</p><p>The devices come with all the usual goodies like NFC, state of the art connectivity options and a heart rate sensor. Another addition is fast charging which is 1.5 times fast than the S5, although we\u2019d have to get our hands on the device to see if it can match up to Oppo\u2019s.</p><p>There is no word on pricing and availability just yet but keep an eye on this space .</p><p>Samsung had been having poor quarters due to Apple having a strangle hold on the high end of the market and mounting pressure by Chinese manufacturers who were providing the same specs at half the price. Their options were to go all in with the high end or go for mass volume by competing with the likes of Xiaomi.</p><p>It\u2019s clear that with the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, Samsung\u00a0has gone back to the drawing board and come up with a pair of premium devices that match everything the competition has to offer. However, we cannot be sure how the market will respond to the subtraction of the removable battery and memory slot.\u00a0It\u2019s certainly going to be a very interesting battle to see who comes out on top in 2015.</p>", "title": [" Samsung Finally Goes Premium With the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge "], "author": ["Syed Talal"]},

These customers were assured that their stolen money would be\u00a0reimbursed as soon as possible but it would take time to get the details of the affected customers and reimburse the money.</p><p>Things weren\u2019t\u00a0straight forward for everyone though. \u201cWhen I contacted branch manager, he said that your account got trouble due to criminal activity\u201d, an affected customer told ProPakistani. \u201cI was advised to meet bankers working in the fraud department in order to get my money back.\u201d, he added.</p><p>Despite the promise of quick action,\u00a0there are many customers who have not been\u00a0reimbursed\u00a0their money yet, which is simply\u00a0poor quality of customer service.</p><p>The inconvenience didn\u2019t stop at stolen money. Customers were also deprived of debit card services as the hackers accessed data records of customers debit cards to transfer money from Pakistan to England. So in addition, customers\u2019\u00a0debit cards were blocked by bank and such customers were asked to get their debit cards re-issued by SCB again.</p><p>Farhan Ahmed, spokesman of Standard Chartered Bank, said that attacks on the bank were not new. A\u00a0recent skimming attempt at SCB ATM took place which is not unique but a common activity in the banking industry of Pakistan.</p><p>ATM skimming is a type of fraud which occurs when an ATM is compromised by a skimming device, a card reader which can be disguised to look like a part of the machine. The card reader saves the users\u2019 card number and pin code, which is then replicated into a counterfeit copy for theft.</p><p>\u201cThe money in the customers\u2019 bank accounts is insured and given to them in case of any such incident. The money of the customers is being reimbursed and majority of them received their cash in their accounts already\u201d, he added.</p><p>It is an irony that despite the\u00a0continuous growth in profitability and increase in\u00a0customer base, the bank failed to equip its operations with advanced technology which could have prevented such a hacking attempt from being successful.</p><p>If foreign banks with international repute such as Standard Chartered Bank can\u2019t ensure the security of their\u00a0systems,\u00a0how can\u00a0people trust financial institutions and accept advanced service like mobile banking and internet banking?</p><p>Of course, incidents of fraud happen in advanced countries as well but in Pakistan perception is more than reality when it comes to banks and technology and this will surely deal a blow to the reputation of SCB in the country.</p>", "title": [" Hackers Steal Money from Standard Chartered Accounts by Hacking ATMs "], "author": ["M Yasir"]},

{"date": ["Jun 19, 2015"], "text": "<p><img class=\"  wp-image-70075 alignright\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_0083-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0083\" width=\"433\" height=\"288\">I studied chemical engineering at Imperial College London and no one in my family has ever had an IT business of their own, so you could say I started this venture from absolutely zero. There are both advantages and disadvantages to being in that sort of situation, and I capitalised on the former and learned from the latter as I went along.</p><p>My brother Imran Ali Khan was working for a well-recognised international firm after graduating and I was sort of the odd one out in the family, because straight out of college I had set up an e-commerce portal in the UK instead of going out and looking for a job. It did well \u2013 well enough that after a few months my brother quit his well-paid job to join me in taking things forward.</p><p>Zameen.com came into being around that time, when Imran and I realised there was a desperate need for a trustworthy online real estate enterprise in Pakistan, especially given the importance the average Pakistani attaches to property. Though both of us are British nationals, we had always wanted to return to our homeland and set up our lives there. This was as good an opportunity as any to do so, so we went ahead with it in the summer of 2006.</p><p>Zameen.com started in our bedroom. Today it is the largest and most successful real estate website in the country by far and employs close to 300 people across the country and beyond, so you could say it\u2019s been quite a journey.</p><p>We realised early on that there are two things investors look for: a good scalable product or idea, and the people capable of pulling it off. We were among the first tech companies in Pakistan to get venture funding and this was precisely why: we successfully showed investors that not only was our idea a good one, we had already pulled it off and now needed funding to scale and grow.</p><p>Our angel investment came from Gilles Blanchard, who is one of the world\u2019s foremost authorities on online classifieds portals, having founded France\u2019s first and largest property website SeLoger.com way back in 1992 when the internet was still in its infancy. Gilles, who came on board as Chairman, was instrumental in connecting us with investors from around the world. Our reach expanded further when global internet giants Frontier Digital Ventures and Catcha Group invested in Zameen.com.</p><p>So good networking is also essential when it comes to securing VC funding. We attend conferences around the world, avail speaking opportunities and exchange information with everyone from the global property portal industry. This has helped us put ourselves and Pakistan on the map, and I\u2019m happy to say we haven\u2019t had to look back. Our venture rounds continue and today we have our pick of investors, which is a great position to be in.</p><p>Entrepreneurs have to understand that if someone is giving them funds, they are going to expect them to meet certain targets. Having a plan in place to achieve these targets and executing that plan well, I suppose, are the biggest challenges that accompany investment of any kind.</p><p>Because of the constant negative portrayal of Pakistan in world media, a big barrier to overcome with foreign funding in particular is dispelling this errant notion of the country being a troubled place where nothing is flourishing. We know sitting here that this couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth, and the challenge is to show foreign investors that this is the case. More or less every country in the world has its own set of geopolitical risks when it comes to investment, and Pakistan is no different.</p><p>There is another challenge as well: VCs are always looking at how they can exit and take their money out of the country, so even though Pakistan is really business-friendly in that sense, there are a few small complexities which can be simplified to accommodate and boost foreign investments.</p><p>In my experience, startups should start looking for VC funding from day one, or as soon as they have a business plan in place. Investors invest in teams, so you have to know your product inside out, and you have to be passionate about it and know your market like the back of your hand.</p><p>Our platform stands out because quality has been our focus from day one. Zameen.com currently has around 1.3 million property listings and they have all been manually vetted to ensure they are authentic. We employ a team of professional photographers who go out and take pictures of properties so that our users get the best possible information</p><p>We are also acutely tuned in to the average Pakistani mind and how it thinks about real estate, which sets us apart more than anything else, I guess. People connect with us because we are familiar, comfortable and relatable as a brand, and this has allowed them to trust us as an enterprise.</p><p>I think our success also has a lot to do with our corporate culture. Everyone is family at Zameen.com, and talent and ideas are valued regardless of where they come from. Our people are ready to take charge and see things to the end when an idea emerges, and we actively encourage them to do so.</p><p>Zameen.com is highly diverse because it is an equal opportunity employer. We have highly qualified women heading several departments and we employ many non-Muslims in our offices around the country. We are also a fairly young company, the average age of our employees being 26 years.</p><p>Going abroad does broaden your horizons because the education systems in, say, the UK, US or Australia are designed around challenging the students, which opens them up to new possibilities and trains of thought. Having said that, there is a lot of talent in Pakistan that needs to be nurtured. We regularly judge competitions, speak at seminars and take part in university mentorship programmes and it is incredible how smart locally born and bred young entrepreneurs are, and how passionate they are about doing their own thing.</p><p>But when these kids go out to look for investment, they usually encounter a few hurdles. Foreign investors prefer funding entrepreneurs who have studied or lived abroad, but we want this to change. We want to project a better image of Pakistan by bringing forth pure Pakistani talent and creating an ecosystem that is more suitable for this talent. We are committed to doing our bit and in future plan to conduct seminars and connect the local talent with foreign funds.</p><p>Before we started Zameen.com, we were running about a 100 different websites catering to different markets. Around 2008, we started focussing on property niche.</p><p>We founded Bayut.com, which is a leading UAE property portal, in 2008 because property is where our expertise lies. It is important to focus on your strengths and expand on them, because when VCs and international players look at you, they also want to see if you have scalable solutions. Can you take your business abroad, how many countries can you expand to, etc.</p><p>Bayut.com made sense because of Pakistanis\u2019 unique affinity for Dubai, which gives Zameen.com and Bayut.com incredible synergy. Our oldest brother, Haider Ali Khan, currently heads Bayut.com full-time and he has spearheaded the portal\u2019s ascent as one of the top property websites in the Emirates.</p><p>Though Zameen.com is already synonymous with property in Pakistan, out journey is far from over. Over the course of the last few years, we have expanded exponentially in terms of traffic, clientele and human resources with over 1.3 million monthly visits, 7,000 registered real estate agencies and a team of more than 300 people in 16 cities across Pakistan and beyond. That comfortably puts us at eight to ten times bigger than our nearest competition.</p><p>On the tech front, we are working on some really cool tools and features. We\u2019ll be rolling out Pakistan\u2019s first property index very soon, which would be just a glimpse into our efforts to equip the people with more knowledge so that they can make well-informed real estate decisions.</p><p>Don\u2019t try to execute all your ideas at the same time. Identify your best idea with the most potential and see it through to perfect execution. I\u2019ve seen many entrepreneurs lose focus and ultimately make a hash of what could have been a highly profitable idea.</p><p>My other piece of advice would be to find a mentor. An industry professional who could guide you and help you learn, grow and raise funds would be an invaluable asset. Unfortunately, though, there is a lack of mentors in Pakistan and not many industry experts are willing to take the country\u2019s budding talent by the hand and guide them to success</p><p>Imran and I personally try to do our part when it comes to mentoring young entrepreneurs. A lot of them come to us for advice and we are happy to take time out to guide them. We also make it a point to remain in touch with universities and entrepreneurial societies, which often ask us to speak at seminars meant to guide young entrepreneurs.</p>", "title": [" Exclusive Interview with Zeeshan Ali Khan, CEO of Zameen.com "], "author": ["Syed Talal"]},

However, the consequences for people hired with no guarantee of work can often lead to damaging psycho-social effects on their mental health. It gives rise to the question of whether or not unemployed individuals are always better off in work.</p><p>Based on social norms and wisdom, being in work is good for one\u2019s income, self-esteem, dignity, relationships and health, regardless of the nature and quality of the job. Working a poor quality job that is tedious, mundane or representative of a poor match for one\u2019s skill is often perceived as a good way for the unemployed to remain in touch with the labor market as well as to retain the work habit.</p><p>In a survey conducted by the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA), it was found that work of poor psychosocial quality does not grant the same mental health benefits as employment in jobs with high psychosocial quality.

{"date": ["Sep 29, 2015"], "text": "<p>ProPakistani recently got a chance to talk to Bjarke Mikkelsen, who is the CEO of Daraz Asia. The discussion comes at the heels of a <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/09/22/daraz-group-raises-56m-million-in-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">$56 million funding round</a> so we there\u2019s never been a better time to discuss Daraz and the ecommerce market in Pakistan!</p><p>Daraz is a holding company with subsidiaries in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Pakistan. The new investment is in Daraz Asia, not specifically one market. Daraz is owned by the Asia Pacific Internet Group which in turn in 50% owned by Rocket Internet and 50% owned by Ooredoo, a Qatar based telco.</p><p>Now, the holding company is now welcoming on-board CDC Group, a development finance institution owned by the UK government. 20 million Euros are being put up by CDC while 30 million Euros are being invested by existing investors ie APIG.</p><p>CDC Group was set up by the British government after the second world war to secure food supplies by investment in trade partners. So while it may seem like just another investment, there\u2019s a larger interest in seeing Pakistan and Bangladesh being more developed. This investment won\u2019t only go into marketing and advertising but it\u2019s also going to create real jobs on the ground. That\u2019s something important to CDC and us as well. The money will be spent mostly in existing markets of which Pakistan is by far the largest and an appropriate portion will of course will allocated to the country.</p><p>I would say that Rocket Internet is a big organization where there are a lot of best practices that were initially shared. Today, Daraz is its own company. We operate independently, we have investors to whom we need to deliver results and they want to see healthy results. Rocket Internet\u2019s support is valuable and we still share best practices but the initial setup was more relevant from Rocket Internet\u2019s perspective rather than running the business on the ground today.</p><p>There\u2019s no specific allocation to Pakistan but it\u2019s the biggest market and naturally, a large part would go to Pakistan.</p><p>For me, Pakistan and Bangladesh are two markets that are developing very fast. Pakistan is maybe further ahead due to better internet penetration but in terms of ecommerce both countries are more or less on par.</p><p>We are pretty comfortable in saying that we are the biggest player in the ecommerce market in Pakistan.</p><p>In terms of development, an interesting way to look at it is by comparing internet penetration to ecommerce penetration. These are two metrics that follow each other and have a very strong correlation. In the beginning, when ecommerce is just starting up, you see incredible growth to just get the market going and that\u2019s where we are right now. To say anything about the longer term, I would look at how fast the internet penetration is going to grow and ecommerce would be closely correlated with it. Right now, we are creating the market so we expect solid growth over the next 12 months.</p><p>One of the big challenges is that Pakistan is a very big and fragmented market. For other countries, the ecommerce market is usually concentrated around the major cities. In Pakistan, that\u2019s not the case and that\u2019s what makes us very excited for the market as well. We have seen huge activity from tier 2 cities outside of Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi. That means we have to develop an infrastrucutre that can deliver the best possible customer service to everyone in this country. And that\u2019s a big challenge. Currently, we are delivering our own packages in Lahore, Karachi and Islamabd. Outside of those cities though, we are relying on our delivery partners. If you think about it, there are only two people who interact with the customer are the customer service representative and the guy who delivers the package. So if you want a premium customer experience, it becomes a huge challenge and it\u2019s something we are working on. If you don\u2019t control every single delivery, there is a always going to be some variability.</p><p>One big thing that we\u2019re working on currently, is an event we hosted with Google called TechMela. I would say that it\u2019s one of the first big ecommerce events in Pakistan which focuses on bringing the best possible deals to customers. We\u2019re also bringing Black Friday Sales to Pakistan around late November in partnership with EasyPay. Over the next 3 months, we are also going to focus efforts to optimize our mobile apps. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve been seeing a very fast transition from desktop to mobile. Those are the two key thing you can expect from our side.</p><p>Currently, we have about 400 employees in Pakistan. That\u2019s going to grow. I don\u2019t expect it to be as much as our revenues will grow because of economies of scale but it\u2019ll surely be in multiples of our current work force over the next 12-18 months.</p><p>To answer the question, it\u2019s important to mention that Daraz started a long time ago in 2012 as a fashion business. It was only in November 2014 that we decided to sell electronics and general merchandise goods. So Daraz in its current form, which is a general business similar to Amazon, has only really existed since November last year. Since then, we have grown more than 3 times. We can\u2019t mention any hard numbers since we decided not to in financing round but what we can say is that the number of visitors on the site is 6 million per month and growing.</p><p>First of all, Daraz is a marketplace. We can of course control who can sell on the market but in the end, it\u2019s the sellers and buyers who interact. In the long term, these issues will not exist. We already have a ratings system on the website and eventually, everyone will know who are reliable sellers. In the mean time, we are very actively de-listing sellers who don\u2019t comply with our requirements. When you begin a business, you need maximum vendors to make sure customers have their pick.</p><p>Now, we have enough vendors so over the last 3 months, we have focused on improving the quality. So if a vendor has consistent returns or out of stock of items or complaints, we de-list them and they have to go through a training program to come back. We are at a stage where we can afford to be selective about who we work with. This is not something that happens overnight; it\u2019s a journey, but we are working very hard on it.</p><p>It\u2019s not hurting our business and it\u2019s not holding us back but from the customer\u2019s perspective and from a working capital perspective on our side, it\u2019s better to have an efficient payments system. The payments challenge in Pakistan is the low credit and debit card penetration. So even if there was a Paypal, it\u2019d apply to a small portion of the country. That\u2019s why we find a system like EasyPay really interesting. We\u2019re partnering with them for the first Black Friday event in Pakistan and it\u2019s poised to be quite big.</p><p>Right now, we are going to focus on the existing 3 Daraz markets. In 2016, we may or may not go to additional markets. For now, we are focusing on building a healthy business with good customer experience for the 400 million people in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar.</p><p>I\u2019d rather not comment on the government part because I\u2019m not a specialist in Pakistani regulations. But overall, the climate for doing business is improving. We have good relationships with the key regulators. I do think there is a lot of need for dialogue and development but I\u2019m not the best person to go into details on that.</p>", "title": [" Pakistan Is One of the Most Promising E-Commerce Markets in Asia: Daraz Asia CEO "], "author": ["Syed Talal"]},

{"date": ["Jan 21, 2015"], "text": "<p>Social Media has been the buzzword for the past few years, but how has it evolved makes for interesting research.</p><p>While researching and writing on <a title=\"Make Sure You Don\u2019t Suffer From Digital Amnesia!\" href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/01/15/make-sure-dont-suffer-digital-amnesia/\">Digital Amnesia</a>, the one basic fact that I came across in a lot of material was how social media enabled us to upload our memories and the enormous amount of data we were putting up on the internet through various social media platforms. What further intrigued me was how social media has evolved over time and can we predict what the future holds for some of the currently most popular social media platforms.</p><p>The term social media might have originated slightly later but social platforms can be traced back to the early days of the internet when services such as AOL, Yahoo and MSN would want its members to create their profiles to chat. Come the 2000\u2019s and we saw social media platforms such as MySpace and Orkut. These were around for a few years and then just faded away.</p><p>There could be multiple reasons for these platforms losing traction ranging from the launch of Facebook to their respective users outgrowing what they were offering. While global statistics regarding social media use are rare, we do have interesting statistics pertaining to usage in North America. One such interesting stat is how with the launch of Facebook and other social media sites sage amongst teens jumped from 9% to 49%, with Facebook now having almost 1.35 billion active users across the globe.</p><p>While social media can truly be termed as altering the way people perceived and used the internet, the question is where is it heading? According to certain experts the days of public profiles are numbered and anonymity will gain importance in the coming years. What they are referring to here is while teens have been the driving force for social media platforms; of late more and more elders are now utilizing these platforms.</p><p>Take for example Facebook, according to the latest research figures from PEW For the first time, <i>more than half of all online adults 65 and older (56%) use Facebook. This represents 31% of all seniors</i> and this is leading to what some in the USA have termed as the <i>grandpa on the dining table syndrome</i>, meaning as far as teens are concerned now with their parents, aunts and uncles on Facebook they don\u2019t have the freedom they once enjoyed. The survey further reinforces the point by stating that while Facebook is still the most popular social media networking site its growth has slowed down.</p><p>One of the main factors is now we might be looking for more privacy and are thinking twice before accepting that friend request. Industry experts see the future of social media in micro-communities. Their claims can be verified when we see astounding growth in social media platforms such as Tumblr, Snapchat and Instagram. Tumblr\u2019s active user base grew by over 120% last year; the trend from reading tweets is shifting to seeing short bursts of picture memories in the form of Instagram.</p><p>According to PEW, <i>for the first time, roughly half of internet-using young adults ages 18-29 (53%) use Instagram. And half 0f all Instagram users (49%) use the site daily</i> and if that\u2019s not proof enough then we all know why Zuckerberg paid as much as he did for Instagram and why Tumblr rejected his offer of $3 billion. On the other hand LinkedIn continued to grow as more and more professionals connect.</p><p>The amazing fact is while the above mentioned platforms shrink or gain users, YouTube\u2019s usage continues to grow and all social media platforms are optimizing themselves for YouTube. The emphasis on video content is now far greater than ever. People are creating, communicating and consuming more and more content every second. This has also led large corporations jumping big time onto the social media band wagon and hence over the past few years with digital marketing the new frontier for advertising, the lines between the old and new media have been blurred.</p><p>These large corporations now want more and more users to share their brand experiences through the content that they put online. Digital marketing will be taking on a new shape as soon as wearable technology goes mass market, social media would be how we live and what we do. This might scare many amongst us, as all this sounds stuff right out of <i>Minority Report</i>; but the opportunities are also limitless.</p>", "title": [" The Evolution of Social Media "], "author": ["Jahanban Tahir"]},

The result isn\u2019t as snappy as the final solution and will be slow and lack advanced integration.</p><p>Mozilla will eventually deactivate old add-ons that work on it. The deprecation will be carried out six months after the Electrolysis (process-per-tab) is launched which means June 2016 and will be completely removed from Mozilla Store in December 2016. After that addons that have not updated to the newer API will be removed by June 2017.</p><p>Mozilla will implement WebExtensions API to replace the old one. This is based on the same technologies as the API in Chrome and Opera. Edge has been announced to support Chrome extensions as well. Firefox will be entering the club too, though, the extensions will be downloaded using Mozilla Store. This will be done to sign the add-ons and mark them secure before the users use them.</p><p>Digital signatures will be forced started version 42 (November 3rd) for the current extensions as well. Version 43 will introduce a separate process for tab content with deeper changes in tow. This marks Firefox\u2019s historic entry to the multi-process era and also means that the Firefox might be leaving the extensive add-ons support that it has been famous for.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/mozilla-sets-plan-to-dump-firefox-add-ons-move-to-chrome-like-extensions/\" target=\"_blank\">ArsTechnica</a></p>", "title": [" Mozilla to Support Chrome Extensions "], "author": ["Aadil Shadman"]},

We long to create something so brilliant that can help us take the leap from being planet bound creatures to becoming a galaxy conquering super species with immortal lifespans and a limitless knowledge pool.</p><p>Naturally, a dream this big can both excite and intimidate us. There are questions that need to be answered and scenarios that need to be considered before we should decide to create such a sentient machine upon which might potentially rest the fate of our entire kind.</p><p>There are two sides to the artificial intelligence debate; one side that fears the consequences of an all-powerful AI, and the other side that thinks such fears are premature and blown way out of proportion.</p><p>In a nutshell, one group believes a sentient and powerful AI will eventually go rogue and destroy mankind while the other group believes that even such a powerful AI will have limitations, which will stop it from committing the genocide of our species and instead just be a tool for our advancement. Pop culture reflects both these sides as well with movies like the Terminator and Ex Machina warning us about the dark side of developing such a powerful AI while others like Star Trek showing us the possibilities of utilizing such an AI in a positive way.</p><p>However, developing such an AI is the final step in the evolution of computers and we will first have to make a lot of decisions as a community before we get to such a step. The biggest AI question that is relevant to our technological capabilities of today is the development, and subsequent use of AI weapons. We may not have computers who feel emotions at the moment but we definitely have the ability to generate weapons that can use algorithms to identify and eliminate enemies, whoever they may be, without human oversight.</p><p>Imagine a world where instead of a human pulling the trigger, it is actually a robot doing so. We humans have emotions, empathy and also we can modify our plans on the go but an artificially intelligent weapons doesn\u2019t possess such qualities. It will, theoretically, kill indiscriminately if used that way where a human may flinch. This is the opinion of many of our world\u2019s leading minds like Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates; all of whom have signed a future of life petition encouraging governments to ban AI weapons in order to avert disaster.</p><p>In their opinion, though governments can try to make sure that AI weapons are used responsibly and are carefully monitored, they will eventually fall into the wrong hands who will modify and use these weapons for their own nefarious purposes. For example, if a modified AI weapon is let loose by some terrorist in a crowded place, the damage it can do will be devastating.</p><p>Professor Stephen Hawking meanwhile has been very vocal about the threat a super intelligent entity could pose to mankind as according to him, if it were to \u2018take off its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, wouldn\u2019t be able to compete, and thus would be superseded.\u2019</p><p>While answering questions in a Reddit AMA session, Bill Gates had this to say regarding the threat of artificial intelligence.</p><p>Needless to say, artificial intelligence is a very complex and dangerous commodity, and we have to be very careful with how we decide to move forward in its development. Nobody is calling for scientists to stop developing such a technology, they are just calling for the exercise of caution in such matters.

This new approach seems to be paying off as the latest indications are that the research wing of the company is working on a new mobile charging project called AutoCharge.</p><p>True to its name, one of the goals of the project is to invent a seamless charging experience for smartphones: one where a user does not have to deal with charging pads or cables. The prototype system uses image recognition technology as well as solar power to identify devices nearby and start firing charging photons at it.</p><p>According to Microsoft, their tests indicate that the experimental prototype has an identification time of approximately 0.3 seconds, after which it begins to charge devices almost as fast as existing wire chargers. While people may question the viability of solar charging, due to weak indoor lighting as well as the predisposition of users to carry their smartphones in their pockets where no light can enter, Microsoft claims that it has devised a method to overcome these challenges and is capable of making AutoCharge run 24 hours per day.</p><p>As for the design of the image-recognition technology, it is facilitated by an in-built camera that monitors a surface i.e. your table. Algorithms further detect when a smartphone is in need of a charge, and a rotating motor adjusts the direction of the charging beam so that it hits the device directly.</p><p>However, there is a slight catch. Only those smartphones that have integrated solar panels will be compatible with the AutoCharge.

{"date": ["Sep 15, 2015"], "text": "<p>When 3G/4G services were coming to Pakistan, we thought we might finally have an alternative to cable broadband with high-speeds and reliable connections. What most users never thought was that even the biggest data plans run out especially if you get very high internet speeds. If it\u2019s unlimited, it\u2019s throttled and you don\u2019t get the full potential of you 3G/4G connection. We have made a list of tips that will help you save your megabytes and make your internet data limit last longer.</p><p>If you want to save data, Opera Max Data Manager is a must. It can handle data savings single-handedly. Opera Max provides system wide data compression so that data can be saved while all the apps using mobile data in the foreground as well as the background connect to the internet. The creators of Opera Max built this tool based on the Turbo-mode in the Opera Browser. All data communications go through the Opera servers and get compressed to save data. Opera Max promises over 50 percent data savings for common apps.</p><p>Opera Max comes with advanced data management tools too. Users can select which apps can use the internet, blacklisting apps to save more data. For example, if you have a package plan that gives you free WhatsApp, you can blacklist all other apps and use WhatsApp without worrying that other apps will cost you money by connecting to the internet automatically. Data management is very easy, once you turn on Opera Max over mobile data, you get details to which apps uses how much data and disable their internet access accordingly. You can activate data compression over Wifi too. A permanent notification lets you view your data usage and savings in real-time.</p><p>You can download Opera Max from the Play Store <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.max.global&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>Onavo is similar to Opera Max but comes with iOS support. It may not be as well-known as Opera Max but it can get the task done. It allows users to measure and save data just like Opera with a greater focus on control over apps\u2019 internet usage. Onavo also employs advanced data caching to reduce data usage.</p><p>Onavo can be downloaded on the Apple App Store <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onavo/id423545287?mt=8&amp;ls=1\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and Google Play Store <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onavo.android.onavoics\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>If you have an Android phone, there is a very high probability you are using Google Chrome browser. Yet, most people would be unaware that Chrome has a built-in data saving feature that needs to be enabled manually.</p><p>According to Google, you can save about 50 percent in data consumption by utilizing this feature. The user won\u2019t even feel the difference in web experience. In fact, browsing over mobile data might even get faster. The way this works is, all your data passes through the Google servers, gets compressed and sent to your device.</p><p>To activate the feature, tap on the 3-dot menu button and go to Settings. Click on Data Saver and toggle the option in the top right corner and you\u2019re done. This will help you save data when you are browsing using Chrome.</p><p>When you aren\u2019t using mobile data, some apps continue to use it in the background. Social networking apps, messaging apps and other real-time info apps keep using data in the background. Even the Android OS services keep connecting to the internet using your precious mobile data.</p><p>To prevent this from happening, you can go to Settings &gt; Data Usage and select the apps you want to restrict manually. In the stats, you will also get information on how much data each app is using in the foreground and how much of it gets used up in the background. The process isn\u2019t as simple and easy as Opera Max but it\u2019s an alternative to get the detailed stats and restrict data usage.</p><p>If you want to go the extreme route, you can disable background data usage altogether but keep in mind that you won\u2019t get any real-time notifications.</p><p>The heading pretty much explains what we mean here. Most users keep getting app updates over mobile data, using your precious data without your permission. Huge amounts of data gets wasted on continuous updates.</p><p>To save data, go to Play Store and open the side menu. Go to Settings and select \u201cAuto-Update apps\u201d button and check (tick) \u201cAuto-Update apps over WiFi only\u201d.</p><p>If you don\u2019t get access to WiFi, you can still update apps manually by opening the Play Store and starting the update process by going to the My Apps section.</p><p>Everybody wants to get instant email notifications and get their info synced with all the accounts they have signed-in on their Android smartphone. The first thing you can do is to manually turn on and turn off the sync service.</p><p>The next thing is to go to Settings &gt; Accounts and have a look at all your accounts that use the sync services. There are some services that you never use but they keep syncing and using data. For example, when you select a Google account, you will sync enabled for App data, Calendar, Chrome, Contacts, Docs, Drive, Gmail, Google Fit, Opinion Rewards, Photos, Play Music, Google+, and even more stuff. Most users don\u2019t use half of these services so it\u2019s best to disable sync for the useless services.</p><p>You can do the same thing for other accounts as well.</p><p>Streaming videos, music, looking at high quality images and GIFs burns through your data before you can realise it. Unless you have a very big data package, you must keep an eye on your data usage (Opera Max can help with that too).</p><p>Limit you data streaming since avoiding it must be impossible for most people. Another thing you can do is set the video or sound quality to a bit lower. This will help reduce data consumption.</p><p>Some apps clean cache to save space. It does clean up space but the cached data reduces data consumption by huge amounts. Browser and other internet oriented apps need cache to make them load faster and save on data.</p><p>Some apps allow local storage, like the Google Maps (and some other map apps), Play Music and Google Translate. Some apps can download the data you need which can be done while using a WiFi connection. You can stream or load the content that you might need before you leave your house. That content will get cached and save you some money on your internet usage.</p><p>We hope our list of tips will help you save a lot of data and make better use of those packages that only allow you to get connected with only a certain few apps at cheaper costs. These tips certainly won\u2019t hinder your smartphone without internet but they will make it use less data.

The OS with its new apps, software improvements and more will be coming to iPhone 4S and later, iPad 2 and later, and all the iPad Minis.</p><p>The Watch is getting new leather bands from Hermes and a red Product Red band.

Of course, many choose not to go through this way and prime examples of that would be Nokia and Amazon who have used Android in the past without including services from its maker.</p><p>This means that the era of pre-installed bloatware might finally be over. While in a lot of existing phones you can already disable these services, a root is usually required for a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. More recently, however, phones like Note 5 exclude apps like Google+ to begin with, which is a positive trend and will hopefully be carried on.</p><p>For users of this services, however, they\u2019ll always be available and ready to download without a hitch from the Play Store.</p>", "title": [" Future Android Phones Will Come With Fewer Pre-Installed Apps "], "author": ["Azeem Ullah Hassan"]},

The phone which started it all, now in its 9th-iteration, is not only arriving at a time of record profitability but also extreme competition. Can it do anything new to distinguish itself?</p><p><em>\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s changed is everything.\u201d</em></p><p>The new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus come in the same display sizes as before, with a 4.7\u201d display at a\u00a0750 x 1334 resolution, and a 5.5\u201d display with Full HD (1920\u00d71080) resolution, respectively. But there\u2019s more.</p><p>Force Touch, or as is marketed by Apple, 3D Touch is finally here. It is more sensitive, faster and offers varying amounts of inputs depending on your pressure. Such as if you press the screen\u00a0harder than usual then in the base OS the system will\u00a0open up a contextual menu or peek inside an app menu.</p><p>Different pressing patterns can be defined and used with-in the apps with\u00a0endless possibilities. There\u2019s also a new Taptic Engine which provides real-time feedback to your presses.</p><p>Check below video for a demo on how 3D touch will work:</p><p><iframe src=\"//www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x35xuq3\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p>The Design has changed too thanks to a new aluminum alloy unibody. They\u2019re both heavier and thicker, most-probably thanks to the Bendgate farce, with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus both weighing 143g and 192g respectively.</p><p>They\u2019re also thicker by 0.2mm over their last iterations. Finally, the display now has the Ion-X covering of the Apple Watch.</p><p>The already-powerful A8 processor has given way to a new A9 one, which is said to much faster than before.</p><p>According to hard figures, the 64-bit processor is 70 percent faster in CPU tasks, with 90 percent faster graphics.</p><p>Storage options are the same as before, though, at 16, 64 or 128 GB.</p><p>This\u00a0means as much as you hate Apple for it, the 16 GB variant is here to stay. The M9 motion co-processor has been retained, though it has been improved. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know what the rumours of 2 GB RAM amount to.</p><p>The 8 megapixel sensor has finally been replaced for a new 12 megapixel iSight camera which supports 4K video recording now. It now carries 50% more pixels, as well as focus pixels by the same count. As is usual, the larger 6S Plus also comes with OIS. There\u2019s a new mode called Live Photos which records one second before and after a photo to create a short video.</p><p>The front-facing camera has been bumped to 5 megapixels, with a unique take on front flash. Dubbed the \u2018Retina Flash\u2019, the display now gets 3X brighter with customized lighting to help you take clear selfies.</p><p>The new iPhones support faster speeds over both Wi-Fi and LTE. The number of LTE bands now stands at an impressive 23. Wi-Fi is twice as faster as before while the TouchID fingerprint scanner is said to be just as faster itself.</p><p>Apple kick-started the gold revolution a few years back and now it is time for pink. Officially called \u2018Rose Gold\u2019 the phone will likely be brought by all kinds of audiences like the gold one.</p><p>The pricing is mostly the same as before. The 16 GB iPhone 6S starts at $649 for the standard 16 GB model, add $100 each time you make the storage upgrade. The iPhone 6S Plus instead starts at $749, continue the same step-up ritual here, too.</p><p>This year, Apple has decided to concentrate a bit more on the depth of the iPhone experience. While the end product must be experienced before any judgement, the first impressions certainly look positive.</p>", "title": [" iPhone 6S and 6S Plus Announced With New Designs, 3D Touch and 12MP Camera "], "author": ["Azeem Ullah Hassan"]},

Pakistan was also hit by the sudden change in stock values and KSE was affected the most in the recent turn of events. According to a trader, \u201cForeign investors have been booking losses in (emerging) equity markets plus commodity derivatives elsewhere. They have to make up for those losses by selling profitable stocks in their portfolio elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Pakistan has also been under pressure from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) had notified the constitution of a committee to merge the three stock exchanges. There have been suggestions from the government committees to later offer the stock exchange to some foreign investors. UAE and Sri Lanka have shown interest in acquiring Pakistan\u2019s stock exchange.</p><p>Due to the merger, ISE and LSE will be effected greatly because KSE has been seeing a downwards trend for months. The government has been looking at the Indian Stock Exchange model for the merger. Members from ISE and LSE showed concerns and even refused the proposal which even delayed the merger approval process by quite a few weeks.</p><p>The government committee was tasked to review the current corporate structure of the stock exchanges in line with the Stock Exchanges Act 2012.</p><p>The step was taken to stabilise the KSE, which was Pakistan\u2019s biggest stock market, and had been affected by global financial turmoil. For the greater interest of the Pakistan stock exchange, the merger was approved after extended meetings with the LSE members when they refused the proposal a few weeks ago.</p><p>This is the first crucial step in transformation of Pakistan Stock market. The demutualization of stock exchanges and integration will assist in bringing the market on par with global markets, increasing stock values due to the inheritance of LSE and ISE assets.</p><p>The local competition between the local stock exchanges will also be avoided letting them consolidate their complete energies in attracting foreign investments. PSE will now be able to continue trading and have better resilience against the international financial crises whenever they occur.</p><p>Ownership of the stock exchanges can be shared between brokers and investors with a ratio of 40 to 60 percent. After the introduction of the new capital reform, trade volume is expected to improve several-fold as well.

In a slightly different routine, this year Google announced two new Nexus phones, with the Huawei Nexus 6P being the noticeably higher-end offering than the LG Nexus 5X. Read on for details.</p><p>It seems like Huawei\u2019s meteoric rise in the smartphone industry has not gone un-noticed as this is the first time that a Chinese OEM has contributed to the Nexus program. This also shows Google\u2019s focus on the Asian and developing territories. The thing to note here is the design. The Nexus 6P is made of \u201caeronautical-grade aluminum\u201d, with a unibody just 7.3mm thick.</p><p>The back also boasts a black strip on top around the camera at the top and Nexus Imprint fingerprint scanner just below it. The display is a 5.7\u201d AMOLED panel with QHD resolution (518 ppi). It is surrounded by two speakers up and down.</p><p>Under the hood, you\u2019ll get the Snapdragon 810 processor with a newer and cooler v2.1 refresh. It is complemented by 3 GB RAM and either 32, 64 or 128 GB internal storage. No 16 GB versions here.</p><p>At the back is the same 12.3 megapixel Sony sensor of the Nexus 5X, with 4K video recording, f/2.0 aperture for low-light aid and laser-autofocus.

You also get the Nexus Imprint fingerprint at the back, with a blazing 600ms speed. Pricing is set at $499 for the starting model, and is set to reach $650 with the 128 GB one.</p><p>2013\u2019s Nexus 5 was one easily one of the most popular smartphones of all time. Thanks to its attractive design, beefy processor, stock Android and rock-bottom pricing, the phone remains a popular one even today.</p><p>Now, Google has announced a similar effort for this year\u2019s Nexus program and it\u2019s called the LG Nexus 5X, which tries to emulate the original phone\u2019s success by borrowing heavily from it.</p><p>For one, the design is certainly inspired from that phone.

{"date": ["Sep 18, 2015"], "text": "<p>Growth starts from the roots and research acts as the roots of an economy. Data produced from research, whether in a raw or analyzed form, is essential to keep the wheels of growth in motion. Unfortunately, lack of data has become the norm in Pakistan. The country is far from making such data available and putting it to good use.</p><p>To answer this question, let\u2019s ask some basic questions about the telecom sector. What is the exact number of internet users in Pakistan? How many iOS users are there? What is the approximate number of Android users? How many Qmobile phones are available in the market? There are no available statistics which can adeptly answer these questions.</p><p>We know that mobile phone subscriptions in Pakistan reached 116.43 million at the end of July\u00a02015 and that Mobilink led the market with 33.93 million, according to the latest stats shared by Pakistan Telecommunication Authority. However, this data was not further broken down by operating system, or by mobile phone brand ownership.</p><p>This is not the case with Western developed markets. Not only is the research data available in US for the smartphone market share by operating system, but also specific smartphone manufacturer share (Apple 42.7%, Samsung 29.3%, LG 7%, Motorola 7%, HTC 4.9 % in 2014) This data is then further broken down into specifics. The same cannot be said for Pakistan.</p><p>So there is a dire need for dedicated research firms who can carry out research and establish such data for the technology, telecom and IT sectors, for an accurate and precise decision making.</p><p>There are many reasons why research and availability of data is not the norm in Pakistan. First, while the country has advanced in terms of technology, there are still many parts of Pakistan which remain isolated and uneducated. In addition to this, any attempt at gathering authentic data will ultimately be hindered by lack of accountability. Politicization of data is not only possible but easy to get away with, and this discourages a research culture.</p><p>Then, there is lack of data protection. Data Protection Act 2005 is still in draft form and has not been transformed into law for the last 9 years. In its absence, any data being collected for research purposes or otherwise is vulnerable to being breached and misused. Even if the data is collected by companies with the aid of increased internet usage, most of the populace will not offer the correct information for fear of their identity being stolen or worse.</p><p>The solution lies in creation of credible <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/09/14/the-dire-need-for-think-tanks-in-pakistan/\" target=\"_blank\">independent think tanks</a> which will provide the telecom and IT sectors with an intellectual backbone. However, the data produced by this research will only be authentic if the government takes data protection policy making seriously. With an increased trust and interest by the general populace in participation, gradually the void created by lack of data can be filled.</p><p>That said; there needs to be precision in the data that is already available. For example, various sources declare that Q mobile controls almost 50% of the market with its low cost phones, but there is no specific count of the number of Q mobile phones available and their market share, not even in percentage form. If the companies themselves have this information they are not ready to display it publicly because of lack of data ownership and accountability.</p><p>It comes down to a much needed collaboration between the government, telecom companies and research firms who can ensure that such data is not only available, but is safeguarded so that a research culture develops.

As a result, it\u2019s particularly tough to find a reliable hotel booking service in the country.</p><p>Perhaps, that\u2019s not entirely true in case of five star hotels but what about those Pakistanis who wish to settle for less? <strong>Jovago.com</strong> is an online hotel booking platform that has strived to fill in that gap and mitigate the process of accommodation arrangements for its users.</p><p>The online hotel rental platform allows booking of hotels that were once unknown to people, all from the comfort of their homes. Launched back in 2013, Jovago now connects people to 200,000 hotels across 211 countries, 1,000 of which are based in Pakistan. Whether you happen to be a spendthrift looking to spend your holidays in a 5-star hotel or someone on a budget willing to settle for a cheaper guest house in Pakistan, Jovago has you covered.</p><p>Jovago makes the process of booking fast and easy for users in Pakistan. To make the experience cheaper and more comfortable, it charges <strong>no booking fee</strong> along with the option to pay at the hotel rather confirming one\u2019s stay with a credit card. The idea is to offer all options available to all kinds of travellers at the best prices. Its <strong>best price guarantee</strong> available across all hotels in Pakistan means that if you find the same room in the same hotel at the same date for a cheaper price, you will be refunded the difference.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65871\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Untitled-22.jpg\" alt=\"jovago\"></p><p>The website itself is quite neatly designed with an easy-to-use interface. A detailed description of each hotel is coupled with images captured in high resolution. Users may search a location or a specific hotel, define the period of stay and specify the number of rooms, adults and children opting to stay. Once a booking has been made, the confirmation is received via email.</p><p>It\u2019s not all just about the hotel and the amenities within though; the website also provides information about the city in which it is based, the nearby tourist attractions as well as available modes of transport. That is a clever way of making visitors feel right at home. Whether you find yourself an accommodation near a beach in Karachi or close to the high peaks in Murree, that\u2019s certainly a nice way to make sure you don\u2019t get lost in a new place.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that a service such as this is quite helpful for local residents and tourists visiting Pakistan, alike. After all, customers seek lowest prices available nine times out of ten unless they take pride in being overly generous. There are deals to be enjoyed on special occasions whereby as much as 50% discount is offered on various accommodations across Pakistan. In fact, Jovago is celebrating Pakistan Day by offering 23% off on bookings with the code \u2018PAKISTAN23\u2019.</p><p>Given that AIG, which owns Jovago, also owns services such as <a title=\"Carmudi.pk Organizes a Photo Competition For Car Enthusiasts\" href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2014/05/02/carmudi-pk-organizes-photo-competition-car-enthusiasts/\" target=\"_blank\">Carudi, </a><a title=\"Kaymu.pk Celebrates Two Years in Pakistan\" href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/03/05/kaymu-pk-celebrates-two-years-in-pakistan/\" target=\"_blank\">Kaymu, </a><a title=\"Lamudi Launches Scholarship Fund\" href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/03/10/lamudi-launches-scholarship-fund/\" target=\"_blank\">Lamudi </a>and <a title=\"Easy Taxi: Smartphone Taxi Booking App Reaches Pakistan\" href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2014/01/09/easy-taxi-smartphone-taxi-booking-app-reaches-pakistan/\" target=\"_blank\">EasyTaxi </a>that are commonly used by Pakistanis, it is only a matter of time before these services are integrated and offered as a single platform.

Only small deals are being done here in Pakistan but they are being blown up to create the entrepreneurial hype through clever PR campaigns.</p><p>Pakistan does not have many Angel investors or a VC industry of any significance. Your chances of being funded are not great in the first place. Many of the investors who have the cash may want too much control with the aim of making you like a manager with an incentive plan.</p><p>Figure out early on what it is that you need to develop your idea and what you are willing to give up.

Freelancing is an opportunity for you to learn how to keep your finances and manage money.</p><p>Furthermore, as compared to being a fulltime employee with a fixed pay, you are in a position to negotiate and change your rate. You can double or even triple it, in accordance with the client at hand. Not only this, you can work for multiple clients at the same time and increase your pay as a consequence.</p><p>Look at it this way, how can more money ever be a bad thing?</p><p>As a freelancer, you will have the chance to work with various different clients and in a multitude of roles. This will help you push your boundaries and widen your experience to an extent where you can not only hone your existing skills, but discover your ability to discover talents you never had!</p><p>For example, you may already know that you are a good writer, but if you are required to work with the design of the content as well, you could actually come to realize you are a competent designer. Ultimately, you will develop your core skill set and you will be able to create an image of being sought after rather than seeking clients. So, rather than being stuck in a rut at your job, you will have the opportunity to explore the rest of the path!</p><p>You can do what your love and love what you do. Since you don\u2019t answer to anyone, you can literally take a u-turn with respect to which skill you wish to use as a freelancing opportunity. You are currently an accountant, you are good at what you do, but you don\u2019t have a passion for it \u2013 you\u2019d rather write all day. Leave that life behind and pursue writing as a freelancing career! With freelancing, the world is not only at your feet, but yours to live the way you want to.</p><p>Now that you know all the reasons, ask yourself why you are continuing to work at this job, especially if you don\u2019t like it? Then ask yourself if you want any of the things mentioned above to make your work life invigorating. Above all, ask yourself if you want to be your own boss. Is the answer yes? Then it\u2019s definitely time for you to quit your job and start freelancing! You only live once, make it worth your while.</p>", "title": [" 5 Reasons You Should Quit Your Job and Start Freelancing "], "author": ["Laraib Qureshi"]},

Facebook\u2019s service had added 60 services created by third-party developers.</p><p>The service provides free internet to its users when accessing certain websites and services. The net neutrality violation and maintaining an anti-encryption stand made the platform controversial. Facebook has now renamed the service and overhauled the design. Internet.org will now be called Free Basics by Facebook.</p><p>The other major change in Facebook\u2019s policies is support for encryption and HTTPS. The Android app has already received the overhauled design and supports end-to-end encryption by default unless a developer chooses to support just HTTP. The changes have begun to roll out for the web version as well.</p><p>When accessing the Free Basics website using a web browser, the service uses dual certificates where the traffic is encrypted between internet.org servers and the user while the second certificate is used between the servers and the developer services. Even across services that don\u2019t run on HTTPS, traffic will be encrypted wherever possible. Though, all encrypted information will be temporarily decrypted on what Facebook calls \u201csecure servers\u201d to ensure proper functionality. Facebook says only the domain name will be preserved for each user.</p><p>The new steps are definitely a step in the right direction. Allowing 60 new services through third-parties and employing encryption make the service much less controversial. Though, critiques argue regarding net neutrality that Facebook is trying to take control of the emerging third-world internet market and controlling what these people can see online which is a cause of concern.</p><p>Internet.org is accessible to over a billion people across Asia, Africa and Latin America. The 60 new third-party services will be accessible by searching through for whatever the user requires and are available to everybody who can access Free Basics.

The design is cool-looking too, with a 6.4mm frame and full aluminium unibody.</p><p>The camera is also a major part of the package. It is a 13 megapixel sensor, but is the first in a smartphone to use four types of sub-pixels: Red, Green, Blue and White, which help with the brightness and also in low-lighting conditions.

You can bang your knuckles on the display twice to take a screenshot, or you can crop a section to select part of the snap.

However, it is because of the minister\u2019s vision and passion that the feasibility study has finally started.</p><p>MD PSEB mentioned that IT parks are like software factories where IT companies generate new exports for Pakistan by providing software and IT services to both foreign and local clients. PSEB had arranged meetings of Korean team this week with different stakeholders including IT companies, universities, CDA, Nespak, and Planning Commission followed by a day long strategy workshop with all of the stakeholders.</p><p>The minister thanked the Korean team for visiting Pakistan and emphasized that both ministry and PSEB will extend full support to the Korean team in their mission of building new IT parks in Pakistan.

{"date": ["Jun 29, 2015"], "text": "<p>It\u2019s hard not to run across Internet.org in the news of late. Whether it\u2019s a Pakistani man renting a billboard to thank Mark Zuckerberg for the initiative or the EFF coming out with a scathing assessment, Internet.org has generated a lot of debate. If you\u2019re still unclear about what it is or why it\u2019s so controversial, this is a great place to start.</p><p>Two thirds of the world\u2019s population doesn\u2019t have internet access. Internet.org solves this problem by providing free mobile internet access to selected websites (telecom networks cover approximately 80% of the population). Any website can apply to be part of the venture through an application provided they fulfill certain requirements. However, only Facebook can decide which application gets rejected or accepted.</p><p>Criteria to be part of the Internet.org Platform:</p><p>All internet communication goes through Internet.org\u2019s proxy servers which automatically strip all content that doesn\u2019t follow the guidelines \u2013 like VoIP, images larger than 1MB, videos and so on. It also inserts a warning if a user navigates away from this text heavy \u2018zero-rated\u2019 portion of the internet. It\u2019s this \u2018proxifying\u2019 process that\u2019s of huge concern.</p><p>If you\u2019re using a feature phone, there is no support for encrypted HTTPS connections. To work, the data has to be unencrypted when it passes through Internet.org\u2019s proxy servers. That means anyone can read it. From Facebook to the carrier to government agencies, the data could be exposed to anybody and therein lies the crux of the problem.</p><p>You cannot provide reasonable security with Internet.org\u2019s current technical setup for feature phone users, who are the actual people that need access. Hence, the system is ripe for abuse. Whether it\u2019s Facebook itself mining the data or being a single point of failure which governments can pressure to get information, there is no expectation of security or privacy.</p><p><em><strong>What could fix this? </strong>Facebook says it\u2019s working on a solution for providing encryption on feature phones. If that becomes the default, this concern is mitigated.</em></p><p>\u2018Connecting two thirds of the world to the internet\u2019 is a great tagline but let\u2019s be realistic here. Facebook could start the data collection process even before you sign up for the network. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves either by thinking they won\u2019t. They will. After all, they track what sites you visit outside Facebook, they track what apps you use, they even track what friend requests you don\u2019t accept or the status you type but don\u2019t post.</p><p>Everyone is rushing towards developing countries because they are the ones who are going to drive demand in the coming years and decades. There is tremendous value in locking down potential customers from the get go and that\u2019s exactly what Internet.org could be: the sole access provider to a completely untapped market.</p><p>It\u2019s basically a dream for any advertisement focused company. You control the access, you track the content and you decide what is free and what\u2019s paid. Marketers would kill for the kind of granular data Internet.org could provide if it becomes large enough. With every percentage of population that goes online, the advertising value increases manifold. Are we really supposed to believe Facebook, a publicly traded company beholden to its shareholders, won\u2019t leverage that?</p><p>Some internet is better than no internet, I agree. But there has to be a better and more secure solution than letting another corporation take over the controls. And if you do want to do that, don\u2019t call it the \u2018Internet initiative\u2019 or \u2018philanthropy\u2019 because that\u2019s just posturing.</p><p><em><strong>What could fix this? </strong>Bringing digital rights and privacy focused organizations like the EFF on-board who make sure the promise of free and fair internet with a reasonable expectation of privacy and security is delivered.</em></p><p>Net neutrality is the idea that all internet traffic should be treated equally. With Internet.org, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Initially, Facebook and the ISPs were going to decide what websites were approved. After some incredible opposition though, Facebook changed its stance and said that any website that followed its guidelines would be welcome to be a part of Internet.org.</p><p>The reversal is great but we need to be very observant. Google had a monopoly on search and they abused it to promote their own services and that of their top ad spenders at the cost of everyone else. It would be easy for Facebook to change the guidelines to stifle competition. So we need to ensure that Internet.org has a transparent process that provides everyone a fair chance to be a part of it. That includes websites that might compete against Facebook.</p><p>Most people, including myself, are very opinionated about Internet.org. That\u2019s because we are worried about things like security, privacy and net neutrality (add corporations taking over the world to that list as well). But does the intended audience of Internet.org really care for any of that? The goat herder in Cambodia, the rice farmer in rural Pakistan or the laborer in Malawi?</p><p>There is zero doubt in my mind that if Internet.org remains a fair platform and doesn\u2019t succumb to corporate greed, it could become one of the most important initiatives for the developing world. I don\u2019t trust Mark Zuckerberg but I do appreciate what he is trying to do. After all, who has done anything yet for connecting the rest of the world to the internet? It\u2019s a flawed initiative, yes, but we should try to work out the kinks in a constructive manner rather than trying to derail it completely.</p><p>Remember, while we\u2019re busy debating, more than 4 billion people in the world aren\u2019t connected to the internet. Deciding exactly what we cede in order to provide them access is the multi-billion dollar question.</p><p>So far, activists everywhere have deemed security and privacy too much of a trade off.

Batteries are one of the components that seem to have not improved much. If you want a bigger battery, either you compromise over the price or the size/thickness of the device.</p><p>Researchers at Samsung have announced that they have developed a new technology that could help increase lithium ion battery capacity. Batteries have a cathode and an anode (the positive and negative) that age with use and have limitations that restrict battery capacity.</p><p>Samsung researchers have been able to produce a silicon cathode material that makes a Graphene coating on a silicon surface which increases the energy density. In simpler words, Samsung has managed to double the capacity of lithium ion batteries which are commonly used in smartphones and other such portable gadgets.</p><p>The new coating method for the cathodes of the batteries will help overcome the cycling performance and storage limitations forced by the current technology. The new material used is Graphene, which is an excellent conductor and is plastered on top of common silicon coating without the formation of any silicon carbide. The idea is indeed similar to what several other research groups around the world are trying to accomplish using the same material but with a different implementation.</p><p>Samsung researchers claim that the new technology will allow a full cell to reach energy densities of 972 Wh/l at first charge cycle and 700 Wh/l at 200th charge cycle when paired with any commercial lithium cobalt oxide cathode.

Many analysts have reduced their forecasts for the second quarter over concerns about LG\u2019s latest flagship.</p><p>At the time of launch, LG G4 was expected to sell 8 million units in 2015, around 2.6 million units per quarter. However, the second quarter shipments are expected to be less than 2.5 million meaning that actual sales might be even lower than that. This has led analysts to slash profit estimates and now it seems the company might not even match the $66 million operating profit it posted in Q1 2015.</p><p>One of the reasons that could have hindered the G4 sales is its pricing in different markets. Another could be the lack of major improvements over the G3. The biggest factor might have been LG\u2019s promise of releasing another flagship device later this year which could have resulted in potential customers delaying their purchases until it is released.</p><p>Aside from the G4 sales, LG\u2019s marketing expenditure has definitely reduced the company\u2019s profits. LG has increased their marketing expenditures over the first quarter to present the G4 as a competent alternative to the likes of Samsung Galaxy S6 and Apple\u2019s iPhone 6. Additional marketing expenses mean lesser profits per device.</p><p>Daishin Securities and Korea Investment &amp; Securities have decreased their expected forecasts for LG Mobile division to $50.7 million from $92.3 million and $61 million from $104 million respectively. Another firm, NH Investments &amp; Securities has lowered their forecast to $58 million from $86 million too.</p><p>The joint consensus boils down that LG\u2019s operating profit will fall somewhere between $54 to $59 million which is considerably less than Q1\u2019s $66 million and Q4 2014\u2019s operating profit of $78 million.</p><p>LG\u2019s whole smartphone business is not going downhill as the company said that it would invest $155 million in India and could even set up production there.

{"date": ["Jun 9, 2015"], "text": "<p>Apple revealed the all new iOS 9 alongside several other software revelations at its WWDC event yesterday. The latest iteration of iOS comes with a number of improvements and will go in to public beta starting next month. The full number increase brings very minor upgrades this time around.</p><p>The list of new features is given below.</p><p>Ever since Siri launched several years ago, it forced Apple\u2019s competitors to launch their own versions of voice assistants. Google Now came much later but managed to surpass Siri in terms of recognition, context awareness and recommendations. The new Siri comes close to diminishing that gap finally.</p><p>Siri can track the time, locations and users\u2019 connected devices. This makes Siri aware of what\u2019s required by the user at what time of the day in certain conditions. For example, Siri can remind the user to leave early if there are reports of heavy traffic and without the user needing to ask for the reminder. Siri automatically creates such reminders based on users\u2019 emails and notes.</p><p>Siri has a separate homescreen at the left most pane, just like how Google Now sits on the left pane in the default launcher. The page will accommodate contacts and apps suggestions based on usage and context of the situation and time. There is a specific search ability too, that will let users search apps and even inside apps displaying the info in cards like interface. Interacting with the cards will take users straight into the related app.</p><p>Siri one-ups Google Now with basic caller ID functionality. Siri can identify numbers if the user has been previously in contact with the person on email. Unlike Google, all of the processing and data is kept on the device, according to Apple. This makes it possibly more private and secure.</p><p>Apple is finally bringing the long rumored and awaited split-screen multitasking to iOS. Though it should be mentioned that the feature will only be available on the newer iPad tablets. iPad Air,\u00a0iPad mini 2 and later devices will support the feature. Similar to Samsung, the split-screen comes in both flavors \u2013 the basic and Slide Over.</p><p>Slide Over lets users dock an app to the side of the screen. Simply swiping from the top of an app brings possible candidates for the docking possibilities. The other method is Split View, which splits the screen but the previously used app is greyed out and the user has to switch between the two tasks.</p><p>There\u2019s a video viewer as well which will enable apps to play videos in a small floating, resizable video (hello Samsung!).</p><p>Apple Maps now support public transit in certain markets. This includes buses,\u00a0ferries as well as walking directions between stops. Nearby places can be viewed with just a tap. The feature will be available in markets like US, UK and certain Chinese cities.</p><p>The Notes app finally sees some modifications. The app gets text formatting options alongside the new keyboard. Note app now supports checklists, photos and drawings and even external links via the sharing menu. Notes will be synced with Mac OSX and iCloud.</p><p>Apple has introduced a Flipboard-like app for news. Users will pick their interests at first launch and get personalised news based on those interests in a separate news feed called \u201cFor You\u201d. Apple uses algorithms that can differentiate between over a thousand topics and just like Siri, all of this happens on the device to improve privacy. This service will also be available in certain markets at the time of launching.</p><p>iPad gets a new and improved keyboard. Apple calls the new keyboard \u2018QuickType\u2019. The keyboard has visible shortcuts for cut/copy and paste. It\u00a0can also work as a trackpad just like the ones found on laptops. Trackpad will improve page navigation\u00a0at\u00a0the cost of screen real estate. Apple also hopes to brings improved physical keyboard management to the iPads.</p><p>Car play no longer needs any wires or special interfacing. Even if the iPhone is inside a\u00a0pocket, Car Play can run user apps and certain apps specific to the car\u2019s manufacturer. Car Play now supports high resolution displays as well.</p><p>Apple took another cue\u00a0from Android and Apple\u2019s task switcher now displays running apps as cards. The upgrade process now requires just 1.3GB of disk storage compared to the 4.6GB for the iOS 8 updates. iCloud will get two-factor authentication to improve the security (The recent leaks might have something to do with that).</p><p>iOS 9 will make use of Metal Graphic APIs which should allow improved graphics processing on iPhones and iPads. Apple promises up to 1.6 times increase in performance while reducing the CPU workload by half. iOS 9 is more power efficient too and should improve the battery life by up to an hour. There\u2019s finally a power saving mode toggle too which can extend usage by three hours, according to Apple.</p><p>iOS 9 is expected to be available as a stable update sometime this fall and will support all devices that are running on iOS 8. Adventurous users can try out the public beta that will be available next month.</p>", "title": [" Apple iOS 9: Everything You Need to Know "], "author": ["Aadil Shadman"]},

New demands for flexibility, mobility and convenience are leading to new types of devices.\u00a0 We have identified the top five trends that will define what devices will be used, plus where and how these devices will be used.</p><p><a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/09/10/iphone-6s-and-6s-plus-announced-with-new-designs-3d-touch-and-12pm-camera/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple\u2019s iPhone 6 Plus</a> (5.5 inch screen) and <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/08/27/galaxy-note-5-now-available-in-pakistan-for-rs-82000/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 5</a> (5.7 inches) are examples of phablets \u2013 extra-large smartphones which have the form and functionality of a tablet device. These larger form factors are exploding in popularity with shipments in the APJ region,reaching 12.6 million at the end of 2014 \u2013 a year on year growth of 225 per cent.</p><p>Screen size was cited as the main reason for buying a phablet by both iOS and Android buyers at 43 per cent and 47 per cent, respectively,enabling greater on-the-go consumption of content rich social networks and apps, including Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.</p><p>Consumption of online mobile video has been at the centre of mobile data traffic growth in the Asia Pacific region, which now accounts for almost 50 per cent of all mobile data traffic consumed globally.</p><p>The increase in popularity of larger mobile devices will only serve to increase this consumption, as owners of larger screen phones consume 44 per cent more data than those with smaller screen mobiles. The trend forecasts that nearly three-fourths of the world\u2019s mobile data traffic will be video by 2019. It will increase 13-fold between 2014 and 2019, accounting for 72 percent of total mobile data traffic by the end of 2019.</p><p>If asked to speculate which screen captures most of our attention on any given day, many will likely say television, or somewhere between TV and smartphones. The reality is it\u2019s not even close \u2013 smartphones dominate when it comes to screen time spent by users in APJ on any given day.</p><p>This is particularly true in emerging markets such as India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, where the minutes spent viewing smartphones is around double (and in some instances a lot more than double) the time spent watching TV[5].</p><p>Consumers in Thailand spent an average of 167 minutes per day on their smartphones compared to 78 minutes watching television. In Vietnam, the difference was even more pronounced, with an average of 168 minutes per day spent on smartphones compared to just 69 minutes watching TV.By way of comparison, in Australia, the viewing figures are almost neck and neck, with an average of 132 mins spent on smartphones and 125 mins watching TV.</p><p>The next wave of mobile tech is widely expected to be wearable technology. In Q1 this year, 11.4 million wearables were shipped, a 200.0% increase from the same period of last year. This trend is set to continue, with forecasts of 126.1 million units by 2019.</p><p>We are already familiar with smart technology in the form of watches and fitness trackers but innovations in this sector are set to produce a multitude of smart connections with the items around us.</p><p>At this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled a new button-sized computing system, <a href=\"http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2015/01/06/intel-ceo-outlines-future-of-computing\" target=\"_blank\">Intel Curie,</a> which is designed to inspire innovation across industries, powering efficient and intelligent wearable solutions for new and unexpected form factors, such as rings, bags, bracelets, even buttons.</p><p>Fashion is one arena we can expect exciting developments. Last year, wearable technology debuted on several catwalk runways last year, merging the worlds of fashion and technology in new ways, with the launch of the luxury smart MICA bracelet designed by Opening Ceremony and Intel. Another example is the MIT technology collaboration with Jon Lou to develop the <a href=\"http://iq.intel.com/wearables-runway/\" target=\"_blank\">314</a>, considered to be the world\u2019s first intelligent handbag. It charges your phone, lights up in low ambient lighting, and learns your charging behaviour to always keep you charged.</p><p>The future is most certainly bright for wearable technology and likely to be more integrated into how and what people are already buying.</p><p>The huge popularity of mobile devices in the region presents a huge opportunity for mobile marketers in the region. While the early days of mobile marketing were predominantly concentrated on the mobile equivalent of \u2018spamming\u2019 \u2013 unwanted text messages and phone calls \u2013 the current wave of mobile marketing is all about permission-based messaging that reaches the consumer at the right time in the right location. The ability of mobile devices to pinpoint where we are at any given time is transforming the way in which we are marketed to, and APJ is leading the way in this new targeted form of marketing.</p><p>Advertisers are tuned into this shift, given almost half of all consumers (45.6%) in Asia made a purchase using their smartphone last year compared to just 19.6% of Australian consumers.</p>", "title": [" 5 Mobile Trends to Watch Out For in Asia "], "author": ["Guest Author"]},

Isn\u2019t Android and iOS enough to meet our needs? The reality is there\u2019s always room for improvement and innovation even in saturated markets like mobile operating system. There are many problems that are needed to be fixed in both operating systems. Following are few of the problems:</p><p><img style=\"background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;\" title=\"firefox-os\" alt=\"firefox-os\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/firefox-os.jpg\" width=\"340\" height=\"504\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Firefox OS is 100% open source HTML5 based mobile OS developed by Mozilla Foundation (non-profit organization). The idea behind it is to make web as the native platform for mobile. Every app in it is developed using HTML5 including the Home Screen, Phone Dialer, SMS, Contacts, everything you see on the screen is developed using HTML5.</p><p>In Firefox OS, only browser engine runs above the kernel and device drivers and all apps are executed by that browser engine. Think this way. You have an OS which runs only a browser engine and that browser engine runs all the apps.</p><p><img style=\"background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;\" title=\"everythingme\" alt=\"everythingme\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/everythingme.jpg\" width=\"575\" height=\"492\" border=\"0\"></p><p>Because of this <a href=\"http://www.ifadey.com/2012/07/firefox-os-boot-to-gecko/\">architectural design</a>, Firefox OS consume very less resources. Consuming less resources means many things.</p><p>Few other problems that Firefox OS solves.</p><p>Many of you will argue that Android and iOS are superior because of the ecosystem and the magnitude and quality of apps they offer. Well, I do agree that Firefox isn\u2019t anywhere in the radar yet. But look at the openness of the platform and the potential apps for Firefox platform. It may take some time but ultimately Firefox will be placed best to beat the competition.</p><p>Not to forget Linux, which always struggled with Windows in terms of applications \u2013 but it is still one of the top competitors of Microsoft\u2019s Windows.</p><p>Firefox OS will see the light of the day in summer this year and Mozilla\u2019s initial target is to launch the OS for low-end devices in developing countries, specifically the Latin America and few European countries. The only devices that are available now are <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/25/geeksphone-keon-hands-on/\" target=\"_blank\">Keon and Peak</a>. Both of these devices are developer preview phones and manufactured by Spanish startup <a href=\"http://www.geeksphone.com/\">Geeksphone</a> and the good news is that they are shipping them worldwide.</p><p>Keon is priced at 91 Euro (12,000 PKR) and Peak at 149 Euro (20,000 PKR). Just to mention that entire stock of these devices was <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2013/04/23/geeksphone-sold-out-in-a-few-hours-thats-a-good-first-step-for-firefox-os/\">sold out</a> in just few hours after the launch. But Geeksphone promised to bring them back as soon as possible on there <a href=\"http://shop.geeksphone.com/en/?redirected\">online store</a>.</p><p>Other brands who will manufacture Firefox phones are Alcatel, Huawei, LG, Sony, and ZTE. Few months ago, Sony released Firefox OS <a href=\"http://developer.sonymobile.com/2013/02/27/experimental-firefox-os-software-for-xperia-e-available-for-developers-rom/\">experimental ROM</a> for Xperia E. Alcatel and ZTE are targeting extremely low-end phones. You can check the <a href=\"https://air.mozilla.org/jay-sullivan-mwc/\">demo</a> of Firefox OS running on <a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com/zte_open-5320.php\">ZTE Open</a>. ZTE Open has 256MB of RAM and 1GHz single core processor but still you can see from the demo how smooth it\u2019s running on such low spec phone.</p><p>You maybe wondering why Samsung is not manufacturing Firefox OS phones. Actually they are developing their own OS called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen\">Tizen</a>. Maybe at the end of this year or next year, you will see Tizen devices in market from Samsung too.</p><p>Mozilla is non-profit and I fully support their philosophy of <a href=\"http://tantek.com/2010/281/b1/what-is-the-open-web\">Open Web</a>. About 50% of their source code is written by volunteers. Not only there products are open but also every single web page of there products is open.

The expansion won\u2019t be free, though, in fact it will cost $40 so it better be good.</p><p>The next iteration of the landmark fighting franchise is here at last, after a near-decade long hiatus. Street Fighter V will be released in March 2016 but public beta is open for the PS4 players who\u2019ve pre-ordered this game on the <span data-term=\"goog_1365290037\">23rd of July</span>.</p><p>The major change is the inclusion of the new V-Gauge system, rather than the revenge system which further breaks down into V-Skill, V-Trigger and V-Reversal. Each character has its own unique V-Gauge ratings. Pretty much everything else is business as usual.</p><p>One of the biggest announcements in Sony\u2019s events came from Media Molecule, the brains behind LittleBigPlanet which unveiled Dreams. This is a game where you create your controller to sketch, mold and construct your own dreams and peek into others.</p><p>The game is reliant on a community of dream-makers. The game will make it possible for you to \u2018remix\u2019 others dreams and vice versa.</p><p>The game looks like a moving painting.</p><p>Stuck in development hell for almost a decade, it seems like The Last Guardian will finally see the light in 2016 on the PlayStation 4. The game itself places you, a little boy and your animal-bird hybrid in the ruins of some old, deserted place somewhere.\u00a0Both of you use each other\u2019s instincts and skills to solve puzzles.</p><p>No Man\u2019s Sky is probably the most-ambitious game on the planet right now. Called a \u2018universe-size sandbox\u2019, it puts you in an open universe with literally billions of stars and solar systems, each with their own habitats and life. At one point, the presenter zoomed out to show you the sheer scope of the thing and the stars just kept coming up. Truly astonishing.</p><p>The game first announced in E3 2014 is set to get a release date soon and will be available on the PS4 and the PC.\u00a0 There is a question which hasn\u2019t been properly addressed till now: What will you exactly do in No Man\u2019s Sky? Buying spaceships, discovering new planets, taking part in fights, multiplayer battles and a few others we know. But a definitive answer is surely coming very soon too.</p><p>No, Activision didn\u2019t quite announce a new Call of Duty game, but it did reveal that the map packs which come as a DLC will come to the PS4 first, as a 30-day exclusive. The news marks the end of a lengthy association between Microsoft and the CoD developers.</p><p>Activision can be viewed as Sony\u2019s answer to Microsoft\u2019s EA. The news is huge since the Call of Duty franchise is one of the highest grossing ever with video game sales of worth $10 billion.</p><p>A new Hitman game was announced by Io-Interactive yesterday, termed simply \u2018Hitman\u2019. After the hit-and-miss Absolution, hopefully this will be a better successor to 2006\u2019s solid Blood Money.</p><p>The game in contention will now have an ever-expanding array of missions and locations which will be added over time, sometimes for a limited period. We\u2019re not sure how exactly will that work, though.\u00a0 Agent 47 will hit systems on <span data-term=\"goog_1365290038\">December 8th</span>.

With Windows 10, PCs, smartphones, tablets, Xbox for both personal and enterprise users will be sold under a single banner. The different editions and their features are detailed below:</p><p>Windows 10 Home will be the basic and typical OS for the majority of users for their desktops, laptops, tablets and convertibles. The Home version will host features like Cortana, the new Microsoft Edge Browser (previously known as Project Spartan), Continuum mode for touchscreen devices (which allows the OS to transform as per the display and input method), Windows Hello with facial, iris and fingerprint recognition, Windows Passport and several proprietary Windows apps that are available for all the devices. All other versions of Windows 10 carry the basic Home version features and capabilities.</p><p>All previous Windows 7 and 8 users will get the upgrade for free of the update within the first year of the launch of the OS.</p><p>The Pro version of Windows 10 is targeted towards professional and business users who have slightly more advanced needs than a Home user. Windows 10 Pro integrates efficient management of multiple synced devices and apps and also includes data protection, remote and mobile support via cloud technology and several similar features. Similar to Windows 10 Home users, all previous Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 Pro users will be upgraded to the new version free of cost.</p><p>Windows 10 brings smartphones and PCs at par in terms of functionality. Microsoft had a well thought-out plan that has allowed them to unite the phone and desktop version of the OS. The idea of uniting such unequal platforms received some criticism initially but the details so far show promising results.</p><p>Windows 10 Mobile will replace Windows Phone 8.1 and bring advanced security, productivity and management tools to the small screen devices (that means phones and small tablets). Windows 10 Mobile features Continuum for phone (Transforms to a full OS on a big screen) which brings PC experience to the mobile devices.</p><p>Windows 10 Mobile users will also get the upgrade from previous versions free of cost, conditional to the hardware limitations of their devices.</p><p>With Windows 10, Microsoft has dug deep into the enterprise sector to regain some of the lost market from the Linux OS. Windows 10 Enterprise offers advanced features suited for medium to large sized corporations. The OS offers better security, OS deployment and management and app management with the new version of Windows.</p><p>Microsoft is stepping one step ahead of all its competitors by offering Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise edition which supports smartphones and tablets for their corporate users. Windows Enterprise for mobile devices will include all of the features which are a part of Windows 10 Enterprise. These include the more security, device and productivity management. This version of the OS also allows easy management of the update system.</p><p>Since the inception of Google Chrome OS, Microsoft has been losing share in the education sector. Microsoft wishes to improve its Education sector user base with Windows 10. Windows offers a separate edition for schools and universities. Teachers, students and administrative staff will be able to take advantage of the Windows 10 Education through academic Volume Licensing. Other feature information regarding this version is scarce so far.</p><p>With Windows 10, Microsoft has shown it realises the future of internet of things and has released a separate version for it. The new Windows 10 Internet of Things Core will power internet connected hardware like ATMs, elevators, Point-of-Sale terminals, industry robots and similar equipment.</p><p>Microsoft has already announced that Windows 10 will be the last version of Windows.

Of course, programs such as these\u00a0lend themselves well in regards to flexibility as users can conveniently learn at their own pace. What\u2019s\u00a0equally important is to make learning fun and less complicated. eLearn.Punjab clearly appreciates this\u00a0very fact.</p><p>In order to translate these plans into reality, the program offers digitized material along with online\u00a0assessment tools that complement study materials that students may already possess. As part of the\u00a0first experiment, digitized versions of science text books for students of classes 9th and 10th were\u00a0uploaded.</p><p>Moreover, links to a wide range of supplementary material were shared online. Content is not\u00a0limited to course material but a range of stories have also been added for entertainment purposes.

{"date": ["Mar 18, 2015"], "text": "<p>There has been a lot of debate surrounding China\u2019s decision to build two nuclear reactors near Karachi. While one side believes this is the only option for the power-starved nation; others are adamant that building nuclear reactors so close to a city housing over 20 million people is a huge mistake. Keeping in view Pakistan\u2019s dismal track record in developing pro-active approaches to disaster management and safety measures, it is no surprise that these reactors are being seen as more of a threat than an opportunity.</p><p>Let\u2019s take a look at both sides of the argument to get a better idea of this whole issue.</p><p>The major point cited by advocates of the nuclear reactor is the power crisis in Pakistan. The production of electricity is far outnumbered by the demand of Pakistan\u2019s fast growing population. Therefore, scheduled and unscheduled load shedding aimed at reducing the consumption of electricity is very common.</p><p>In fact most people can\u2019t even remember a time when there was no load shedding. Proponents of the Chinese nuclear reactors say that the fastest and cheapest way of dealing with the country\u2019s power woes is building the two nuclear reactors. With an estimated production of 2.2 gigawatts of energy, the nuclear reactors might just be our only chance at fulfilling our power needs.</p><p>Recently, Director General (Corporate) PNRA Zaheer Ayub Baig said that the chances of releasing radioactive material from the reactors into the environment are very low. He mentioned some of the factors that make the two nuclear reactors, named K-2 and K-3, safe. These include:</p><p>All official statements revolve around the premise that there cannot be an accident. Keep in mind, no one has put forward a disaster recovery plan in case there <i>is</i> a leak. It reminds me of Philip Franklin, the Vice-President of White Star Line, and his famous words about the Titanic: \u201cWe believe that the boat is unsinkable.\u201d</p><p>The opposition to the development of these two nuclear reactors comes from all fronts and various places. The international community\u2019s major concern is that Pakistan is not a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This automatically disqualifies the country from receiving any assistance for its nuclear programs. While China seems to be defying the rule by helping Pakistan, members of the NPT are rising concerns over a non-member country increasing its nuclear power undeterred.</p><p>Closer to home, the opposition to K-2 and K-3 comes from some leading names including well-known physicist Pervez Hoodbhoy and Muhammad Tahir Qureshi, an environmentalist with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Some of the major concerns are:</p><p>While the government and proponents of the nuclear reactors trudge full steam ahead with their plan of providing us with cheap, reliable energy, we wonder just how costly such an endeavor could be in case of an accident. Khawaja Asif, Pakistan\u2019s water, power and defense minister, says, \u201cThe risks are there. You cannot discount them, but you prepare for them.\u201d The real questions is: How well is Pakistan prepared to handle a nuclear disaster?</p>", "title": [" Karachi\u2019s Nuclear Reactors \u2013 Is Pakistan Ready?

The new game also managed to break sales records for the longest-running action series, selling 37 percent more copies than 2001\u2019s Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.

Since these platforms make money through service fees which are based on project estimates, Upwork will make sure that the higher caliber of freelancers who command higher rates have more visibility. This will involve making sure they have a steady stream of high quality work.

The company seems to have opted for a method which will enable developers to port their current code to Windows 10.</p><p>This means that both Android and iOS developers enjoy the luxury of directly bringing their existing games and apps to Windows 10. Microsoft has a couple of new software development kits to thank for this. Courtesy of the new dev kits, iOS developers can fully utilize the potential of the Objective C code whereas Android developers would be able to benefit from C++ code and Java. The idea is to make this transition easy for developers in order to allow them to utilize their existing code and skills to build apps.</p><p>While it may sound like porting apps without having to completely rebuild them must be a piece of cake, the process is actually a tad bit complicated. Terry Myerson from Microsoft gave the reference of Android in this regard, \u201cIf they\u2019re using some Google API\u2026 we have created Microsoft replacements for those APIs.\u201d Ultimately, Microsoft expects all developers to bring their existing code to their OS without a lot of changes. Candy Crush Saga is one of those games that was converted with Microsoft\u2019s tools from iOS code.</p><p>Myerson revealed that Microsoft initially considered getting only iOS onboard but later decided to support both, iOS and Android. The company realized that iOS devices are not available in some countries and support for iOS as well as Android would widen their own spectrum of apps. These apps would only be available via the online store and make use of dedicated Windows online services like Bing maps. It will be interesting to see if this move allows Windows to break free of the trap it finds itself in with a scarcity of apps.</p>", "title": [" Windows 10 Will be Able to Run Android and iOS Apps "], "author": ["Hassan Aftab"]},

This promotion has now ended and orders are being shipped, though the winners of Dubai tickets are yet to be announced.</p><p>Now getting back to review of\u00a0<strong>Ascend G510, </strong>check below the un-boxing and hands on video \u2014 before we go in detail review of the phone:</p><p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/65047426\" height=\"349\" width=\"620\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42412\" alt=\"ascend-g510-main\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ascend-g510-main.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>Now to a brief review of <strong>Ascend G510</strong>. I have tried to compare the phone with <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2013/04/04/huawei-ascend-y300-review-unboxing-and-hands-on/\" target=\"_blank\">Y300</a> throughout the post. So if you haven\u2019t read the <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2013/04/04/huawei-ascend-y300-review-unboxing-and-hands-on/\" target=\"_blank\">review of Ascend Y300</a> \u2013 you should better <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2013/04/04/huawei-ascend-y300-review-unboxing-and-hands-on/\" target=\"_blank\">read it first</a>.</p><p><strong>Ascend G510</strong>\u00a0follows the same generic smartphone design, found in nearly all devices launched by Huawei this year. In terms of design this phone is actually the bigger brother of Y300. It has slightly rounded corners just like Y300, and a total plastic body, but the rubbery feel is now replaced with gloss finish.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42413\" alt=\"g510-above\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/g510-above.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>The phone dimensions are 134 x 67 x 9.9mm and it weighs around 150 grams. The textured cover makes it comfortable to hold but due to the glossy plastic it\u2019s a little slippery.</p><p><strong>Ascend G510</strong>\u00a0is equipped with a BIG 4.5 inch IPS touch screen, which is quite unusual for phone in this price range. The screen offers 854\u00d7480 pixel resolution with a pixel density of 218 ppi, still the images show quite vivid and sharp. Sadly the lack of Gorilla glass makes the screen vulnerable to scratches, So you will have to take extra care of the screen or even better if you use a screen protector.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42414\" alt=\"keys\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/keys1.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>Above the screen there is front facing camera, ear speaker, light sensors and notification LED. Below the screen we have three touch sensitive keys; back, home and menu.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42415\" alt=\"g510-side\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/g510-side.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>The physical keys for power/lock and volume are quite oddly placed in <strong>Ascend G510, </strong>Instead of the regular top or right side positions the power key is placed on the left, just above the volume rocker and it takes a little while to get used to these new positions.</p><p>The microUSB port is also located on the left bottom. So on the right you have got nothing. On the top left we have 3.5mm headphone jack and on the bottom there is the microphone.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42416\" alt=\"g510-top\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/g510-top.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>The back side of the phone is equipped with 5MP Camera, LED flash, speaker and embedded logos of Huawei and DTS. The back cover is actually not a usual cover but a complete shell. Under it we have slots for Mini SIM, Battery and microSD card.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42417\" alt=\"g510-back\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/g510-back.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>The build quality of this phone is nice, but personally I prefer the rubberized feel of Y300, which provides a comfortable and strong grip. Moreover the placement of physical keys and the bigger size makes you a little uncomfortable at first, but after some time you get used to it.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42418\" alt=\"g510-inside\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/g510-inside.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>Just like its younger brother, Ascend G510\u00a0 comes with Android Jelly Bean 4.1.1 out of box and on top of it runs Emotion UI, Huawei\u2019s Proprietary User Interface. This UI provides an easy functionality for the new Android users. Personally I don\u2019t like this interface as its not much customizable and feels bulky.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42429\" alt=\"ui\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ui.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"552\"></p><p>In Emotion UI there is no app drawer, and everything is on your homescreen. In total you get 9 homescreens and you can arrange and re-arrange the apps by putting them in folders. A nice little animations is shown when you swipe between screens.</p><p>You can also add the widgets by pressing and holding the screen. Huawei has also included some of its own widgets, like the \u201cMe widget\u201d which is a collection of different widgets where you can put your contacts, clock, music, weather and gallery widgets.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42430\" alt=\"ui2\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ui2.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"552\"></p><p>Emotion UI comes with different themes plus you can also download new ones. The notification area is also customized and there are many toggle buttons included for quick actions like turning on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and Screenshot.</p><p>This UI also has a profile app, which allows you to select or create profiles with different sound, brightness and data settings.</p><p>By default there is no stock launcher present and the Emotion UI is your only choice. If you don\u2019t like the UI grab some other launcher from Play store but you still can\u2019t get rid of some of the features of Emotional UI because of it\u2019s integration with the OS.</p><p>The company should include an option for users to get back to the stock android and turn off all the Emotion UI features, because they make the phone sluggish. However,\u00a0Huawei has done a great job in customizing the OS to work on low hardware but still there is a need for improvement.</p><p>We are not sure if this phone will get any update in the near future.</p><p>The phone is powered by a Dual Core 1.2GHz processor,\u00a0 512MB of RAM and Adreno 203 GPU.</p><p>Most of the devices running Jelly Bean these days have at least 1GB of RAM, but you can\u2019t get everything in a budget this low. Still the performance of this phone is extraordinary. The Emotion UI is a little bulky and you may notice some lag while swiping through the screens but you can always install any other launcher and make things go smooth.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42427\" alt=\"games\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/games.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"197\"></p><p>Games like Temple Run, Temple Run 2, Battle Monkeys 3D Multiplayer run fine on this phone. You can also play some resource demanding games like Real Racing 3 on it, but you will have to use a microSD card for game data as the phone\u2019s internal storage is just 4GB.(See the video above for games performance).</p><p>It has the ability to play some 720p videos, but the 1080p experience is horrible. Obviously you can\u2019t compare the performance of this phone with Quad core devices with bigger RAM and better GPU, but still Ascend G510\u00a0provides a satisfactory performance at this price tag.</p><p>VoIP applications, such as Viber and Skype, work great on this phone, and the video quality of the front facing camera is amazing. Browsing on this phone very smooth and fluid. The Fast Boot option allows you to power on the device in less than 5 seconds.</p><p>Have a look some of the benchmark results:</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42425\" alt=\"benchmark1\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/benchmark1.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"368\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42426\" alt=\"benchmark2\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/benchmark2.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"368\"></p><p>Ascend G510 has a 5MP auto-focus camera together with a VGA camera on the front for video calling. Unlike Y300 the Camera application is very quick and the LED flash light has white color.</p><p>You can\u2019t expect much from a budget phone Camera, but Ascend G510 performs very well. The images turn out bright and vivid. The lack of physical Camera key makes things a bit difficult but the size of the phone helps to get a good image while using soft key.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42419\" alt=\"camera\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/camera1.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>The Camera app is very basic and there are not many settings to play with. By default you can\u2019t mute the camera sound but there are methods to overcome this issue \u2014 by rooting of course \u2014 \u00a0which will void your warranty.</p><p>The Camera only offers a VGA resolution for recording videos contrary to most of the phones available in market that offer at least a 720p video recording. Some European websites have mentioned that the versions launched there include the 720p recording feature but we were unable to get this confirmed.</p><p>Other than that there are even less settings for video. You can turn on the LED light to record videos in the dark. There is also a standalone Torch app which uses the LED.</p><p>The phone packs a 1730mAh battery, which frankly speaking isn\u2019t enough considering the size of screen and a dual core processor. You will probably get a single day of usage after full recharge, but for users who love to browse over Wi-Fi, play games and multimedia it\u2019s not going to last much longer.</p><p>Amazingly the standby time is much longer and you get a decent time when phone is used only for calling purpose.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42420\" alt=\"battery\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/battery1.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>The built in battery saving app allows you to extend the life, by disabling Wireless connections and turning off animations.</p><p>The phone is recently launched in the market for a price of Rs. 16,750, after taxes. Earlier it was delayed due to the increase in taxes on mobile phones.</p><p>Just like the younger brother Y300, Ascend G510 is available in Black and White colors. 1 year warranty of Airlink Communication will be provided with this smartphone.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42421\" alt=\"final\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/final.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>Usually big phones comes with big price tags, but thanks to Huawei for this budget device which is affordable yet amazing. It has a durable design and delivers a satisfactory performance. Sharp screen, Good Camera and Android Jelly Bean operating system makes the deal even more attractive.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42423\" alt=\"sim-slot\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sim-slot.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>There are some setbacks like low RAM and Emotional UI but still it is a good option in this price range. Huawei should try to cater the needs of Pakistani Customers by adding Urdu support, Localized apps and Introducing Dual SIM variants of these devices.</p><p>Like always there is also a need to aggressively advertise these smartphones. Recently we saw a TVC featuring Y300 but frankly speaking it\u2019s wasn\u2019t up to mark and Huawei needs to do a lot better on this front.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-42422\" alt=\"comparison\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/comparison.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"419\"></p><p>What do you think about this phone, Will you purchase it or go for Y300?

After 4 years at Citi, I decided to pursue my MBA at INSEAD, France and then worked for 2 years as a Management Consultant for Bain and Company in Singapore and Dubai.</p><p>When I moved back to Pakistan, I was really interested in working in the e commerce space as it is a relatively new industry here and there is lots of room for innovation. And I love to travel, so when the Rocket approached me to establish operations for Jovago.com, it felt like the perfect move.</p><p>The opportunity also spoke to my more patriotic tendencies! I felt that through Jovago, we could really make an impact on domestic tourism, not only by offering people more accommodation choice and convenience, but also by \u00a0providing a platform for small hotels and guest houses to showcase their businesses \u2013 improving the overall economy.</p><p>Going abroad has become more of a hassle, and is very expensive. \u00a0Due to these reasons, people are traveling within Pakistan. We are constantly seeing articles and blogs about new places in Pakistan, which shows the extent to which people are actually traveling, and therefore it is a good time to enter the Pakistani market.</p><p>I do see it developing in the coming years. At Jovago, we are in touch with many international travelers, and they have in fact been approaching us about travel in Pakistan. One of the main reasons we launched ourselves was to encourage more and more people to come to Pakistan, and through our social media marketing strategies i.e. blog, facebook page, instagram and twitter account, I think we are reaching a large audience.</p><p>Pakistan is an entrepreneurial and startup market. There are so many things one can do here, which they haven\u2019t, and there is so much room to grow which is why the market is so attractive. Pakistani\u2019s are also very hard workers, who work and work until they get results and therefore people like to invest in good and hard workers. Additionally, foreigners are learning more about Pakistan through media and word of mouth, which is why they are now interested in investing \u2013 there is a lot of scope here!</p><p>The biggest challenge was to educate the small hotels to come onboard with us, and to explain that an online business is credible! They were very used to the concept of a physical travel agency. Also, changing consumers mindsets from booking through the traditional way via a travel agent, to online booking was initially a bit of a challenge. However, so many online businesses are entering Pakistan now which has made the education and communication to consumers a little easier!</p><p>Our team personally visits hotels and guest houses all over Pakistan \u2013 they go to different cities, so far we have 1600 hotels spread across 150 cities.</p><p>When they visit, they inform the hotels and guest houses about what Jovago does, and how it will improve their business. For example, small guest houses are unable to market themselves due to financial constraints, and therefore we are providing them recognition by putting them on our website, and investing in both online and offline marketing for them. These smaller guest houses actually are really excited about Jovago, and have in fact seen a rise in their bookings.</p><p>If anything, it will encourage startups to emerge in anticipation of earning more money by being bought. It will also increase competition, which will drive better results in the country \u2013 every one aspires to be the best so will work to be the best if there is competition.</p><p>There is so much potential in Pakistan for entrepreneurship \u2013 I always encourage people to follow their passion, but at the same time to ensure that they have a solid execution plan and a strong team in place (and funds of course!)- a good idea is not enough to make the business successful.</p>", "title": [" Exclusive Interview with Nadine Malik, Country Manager for Jovago "], "author": ["Syed Talal"]},

Google seems to have a solution for this dilemma; say hello to Google Cloud Storage Nearline.</p><p>Cold storage is what most organisations usually resort to; it involves storing lots of data on tape drives and locking them up somewhere safe. It may be cost-effective given the reduced number of servers to be maintained and the electrical use but it requires quite a bit of time to retrieve data to bring back online.</p><p>Speaking of cost-effectiveness, Nearline is said to fare better than most alternatives in that regard all the same. Let\u2019s just say that the users are set back by the same price they pay for services such as Google Drive and Dropbox that storage much lesser volume of data. For reference purposes, the regular Cloud Storage service offered by Google sets users back each month by about $0.26 per gigabyte.</p><p>It is clear as day that Nearline will come in handy in having backups of extremely important information. However, given the fast pace and cheaper costs it would soon pave way for fresh prospects for mass storage. Google has already joined hands with other storage companies such Iron Mountain, Veritas and NetApp to assist consumers import data to Nearline if they wish to avail the service.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that Google\u2019s cloud service primarily works for data that doesn\u2019t need displaying in real-time; it\u2019s ideal for patient users who can wait a few seconds for data to be retrieved. Analysts believe that Nearline would put Google up against Amazon that offers a service of its own called Glacier. Costing a cent for every gigabyte stored, Glacier takes up to five hours in data retrieval.

He said if companies start advertising in Pakistan, which they should, local webmasters will earn lot better than what they are earning now.</p><p>On other side, Hamad Dar, who covers Music Industry of Pakistan at <a href=\"http://www.koolmuzone.pk/\">Koolmuzone.com</a>, said that even if advertisers\u2019 issue is resolved, Pakistani webmaster will remain deprived of Digg and Stumble effect, social media websites. He claimed that he attracted 1 million visitors in just one month on his newly started blog <a href=\"http://www.smashinglists.com/\">Smashinglists</a>, thanks to Digg \u2013 which was otherwise not possible. \u201cI don\u2019t see Digg effect coming to Pakistan any time soon\u201d, said Hamad.</p><p>Zeeshan Shafquat, a leading Digger from Pakistan commented that we should not wait for Digg or Stumble\u2019s arrival. Instead Pakistani webmaster should realize that it\u2019s a third world country, with half million broadband users at most. We must realize the ground realities and should produce results with available resources, instead of comparing ourselves with Americans.</p><p>Saad Hamid of <a href=\"http://www.sizlopedia.com\">Sizlopedia</a>, a renowned blogger from Islamabad commented that the fear of our local brands to advertise online deeming to receive  unsatisfactory output along with the lack of awareness in people to use  online ads effectively are two of the many reasons.</p><p>He suggests Pakistani brands to understand the value of online ads and  the people should become more diverse in their thinking of searching for  products and services through online ads.</p><p>So what stance should we carry? Should Pakistani webmasters sit and wait until advertisers start flowing in? Should they keep rolling with these low revenues? \u00a0Should they give up the hope and wrap up their businesses?</p><p><strong>What is the solution? What\u2019s the Future?</strong></p><p>Though things are not very positive, but don\u2019t worry guys we are not going to disappoint you. You are definitely not watching a talk show where politicians come in, they speak and then they leave with no conclusion, decision or direction.</p><p>Here is the solution to all these problems (of a Pakistani webmaster), and in fact a potential for hundreds of other businesses of all domains. And the mighty solution is called \u201c<strong>Ecommerce Infrastructure</strong>\u201d</p><p>Let me explain you why</p><p>No Ecommerce Infrastructure means, no online business \u2013 means no affiliate marketing, sales and transactions at all for any webmaster.</p><p>Let\u2019s assume we have Ecommerce Infrastructure in place, and people can buy products via credit card / ATM card.</p><p>In such a scenario, let\u2019s take an example of ProPakistani, which serves 95 percent Pakistani audience, it serves around 10K unique visitors a day, right?</p><p>If ProPakistani partners with Service Shoes, and help them sell 50 pairs of shoes each day (that\u2019s 0.05 percent of traffic) through special discount coupon, for instance, out of which let\u2019s say ProPakistani get Rs. 300 commission for each pair \u2013 how much ProPakistani would make?</p><p>PKR 15,000 per day? That\u2019s correct.</p><p>This amount counts for one affiliate partner, and it may not stop here, ProPakistani would sell mobile phones, SIMs, top up etc. ProPakistani may keep hunting for best margins on affiliate programmes, and will partner with top paying companies.</p><p>As you can see, this won\u2019t benefit ProPakistani only, but Service Shoes would sell 50 pairs with no cost at all. By the way, commission is given to company distributors/retailers as well.</p><p>Now, Service is not partnering with ProPakistani only, they are partnering with, let\u2019s say, 100 other webmasters too. Let\u2019s recalculate the equation; it suggests that Service Shoes may end up selling roughly 5000 pairs per day \u2013 with no retailer involved.</p><p>If question arises in your mind that how in this world, Service Shoes can sell 5,000 pairs each day? Then let\u2019s go to them and check numbers of pairs they sell through their shops \u2013 you will be amazed to know that they are doing even better. Moreover, Internet will take their online shop to those far flung areas, where they won\u2019t reach otherwise \u2013 meaning that more prospects, more business.</p><p>If businesses serving in Pakistan do realize this potential, then they will have to, and they must, push the Government, PTA, State Bank and commercial banks to get us Ecommerce Infrastructure.</p><p>Getting back to webmasters, let\u2019s again assume that Ecommerce Infrastructure is in place, meaning that there are several dozen businesses selling their products online, and each sale earns them money \u2013 they will pay higher for Adwords, its natural.</p><p>As of now, advertisers in Pakistan are paying for clicks; in return they get visitors but not the sales. Imagine, if each click has a potential of converting into sales, won\u2019t these advertisers bid higher for Adwords? Meaning that more CPC (cost per click) for webmasters?</p><p><strong>When will this Dream Come True?</strong></p><p>In 2 years, at most. We got Raseen and PTA working on Ecommerce Infrastructure, but looks they are pretty sluggish in that. Raseen had <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2009/08/05/setup-built-to-establish-first-e-commerce-gateway-of-pakistan/\">plans to deploy and execute their gateway</a> last year, but they couldn\u2019t.</p><p>On other hands we don\u2019t see much of development on PTA\u2019s end, as of now. Though they have met the banks, but usually they talk about Mobile Banking, and not the internet banking. PTA is for sure aware <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2009/06/30/e-commerce-gateway-coming-to-pakistan-thanks-to-pta/\">of the dire need of Ecommerce Infrastructure</a>, but you know its Government Body, things take time.</p><p>Nevertheless, I see this happening by 2012/2013 at most \u2013 by same time, there will be around 5 million broadband users in the country, meaning that tons of traffic.</p><p>So guys, this is the recruitment time, keep focused and don\u2019t lose the hope. Keep serving the local audience as rewards are going to be huge, very soon.</p>", "title": [" Why Does a Pakistani Website Earn 32 Times Lesser than any American Counterpart?

The speculation was that Nokia would commence manufacturing Android operated smartphones in a facility based in China. The news took enough rounds in the media until Nokia caught glimpse of it and decided to quash the rumours with an official statement.</p><p>Nokia made it clear that it does not plan to make or sell smartphones as of now. It outrightly refuted all such claims about a Research and Development facility in China being planned as the site for manufacturing <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/04/14/nokia-networks-demonstrates-its-5g-lte-a-security-solutions-in-islamabad/\" target=\"_blank\">Nokia </a>consumer handsets. Interestingly, despite the rebuttal to these false claims there are further reports of the Finnish company returning to the smartphone market by 2016.</p><p>Nokia\u2019s devices and services division was <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2013/09/03/breaking-microsoft-buys-nokia-devices-unit-for-7-2-billion/\" target=\"_blank\">bought by Microsoft for $7 billion</a> last year which comprised mobile Devices as well as smart devices (Asha, Lumia as well as the X series). It also took over accessories, developer relations, design teams, developer relations, manufacturing and testing facilities along with supply chain services such as Store and MixRadio. All third party contracts and IP agreements pertinent to Nokia\u2019s devices were to be controlled by Microsoft.</p><p>It has been a year since Microsoft acquired Nokia but it turns out that the move hasn\u2019t paid off as well as Microsoft might have wanted. <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/04/27/microsoft-lumia-devices-gain-popularity-but-profits-decline/\" target=\"_blank\">Cost of sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2015</a> seem to have surpassed the sales revenue worth $1.4 billion by $4 million. Reports suggest that the software giant lost nearly 12 cents on every phone prior to the Research and Development as well as marketing costs being accounted for.</p><p>Microsoft believes that its stress on <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/04/16/lumia-540-dual-sim-is-microsofts-latest-budget-windows-phone/\" target=\"_blank\">low-end devices</a> was rather ill-placed. Poor performances by the handsets of late have increased the risk of impariment that will require the value to be written down. This simply means that a further decline in future cashflows is expected which would also increase the likelihood of decline in unit volume growth of these handsets. Microsoft admits that it may have overstated the $5.46 billion paid in goodwill to Nokia. As a result, it\u2019s unlikely it will be able to realize it.</p><p>Microsoft retains the rights to the brand until the second half of 2016 which means that it has twelve more months to try and extract something out of this deal. That actually leaves a window open for <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/04/15/nokia-buys-alcatel-lucent-for-16-6-billion/\" target=\"_blank\">Nokia </a>to reenter the smartphone business some time later next year.

{"date": ["Apr 29, 2015"], "text": "<p>The Android season continues with yet another manufacturer taking to the stage to announce its next big thing. The recent in the line is LG, which has just taken the covers off the new G4.</p><p>Rather disappointing, in this era of technology, there is hardly a thing about the new phone which we don\u2019t remotely know. Still, the phone brings incremental upgrades to the package which was already quite respectable in the first place, and attempts to make phone usage a better experience, rather than shoving specs down the throat.</p><p>The G4 uses a new design which is now <strong>slightly curved</strong> (3000mm radius) to bring a 20% increase in rigidity and endurance in falls. No <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/01/06/lg-unveils-g-flex-2-curved-flexible-smartphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Flex 2</a> but still quite good.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-67956\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fd-lg-g4-group04-700x393.jpg\" alt=\"lg g4 leather back\"></p><p>The biggest step-up from the previous LG phones is the new <strong>leather back cover,</strong> which won\u2019t be coming as default in a lot of markets, we are told. They are available in a bunch of colours, and are the third back-cover option available for the flagship alongside the \u201cMetallic Craft\u201d finish (other name for textured plastic) and white ceramic coating.</p><p>The G4\u2019s display utilizes what is known as <strong>Quantum IPS LCD</strong> which delivers the same accuracy as the displays used in colour grading movies. It brings in 20 percent wider colour reproduction, 25 percent increase in brightness and 50 percent higher contrast than its predecessor. In the end, it is 11 percent more power-efficient.</p><p>The internals of the G4 don\u2019t sound as high-tech, though, which is partly because they aren\u2019t although they can\u2019t be dubbed \u201cweak\u201d either. You get the 64-bit (that\u2019s the next big thing) hexa-core <strong>Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor</strong>, a step below the 810, with 2 Cortex-A57 and 4 Cortex-A53 cores. Alongside it is 3 GB RAM, 32 GB internal storage and a microSD slot for expansion.</p><p>The OS running on this hardware is <strong>Android 5.1 Lollipop</strong>, customized by LG but is said to bring a lot less bloatware than before. There is now a single browser in most markets, Chrome, unlike two as before. You get 100 GB worth Google Drive storage for two years as well as better integration. Furthermore, LG has also worked closely with Qualcomm for better customization.</p><p>At the back is <strong>16 megapixel camera</strong> which is built from the ground up, and has an impressive f/1.8 aperture and laser autofocus. The <strong>new OIS system</strong> now works across three-axes, rather than two for movements up to two degrees.</p><p>A number of high-tech features are in tow such as extensive shutter control, RAW support, high ISO settings and live histogram. You can also shoot panoramas of a truly mind-boggling, 104 megapixel. The Galaxy S6 only supports up to 60 megapixel. Both the main and the 8 megapixel front shooters are capable of making 2160p videos.</p><p>Lastly, the battery has a respectable, <strong>3,000 mAh capacity</strong> and is <strong>user-replaceable</strong>. Wireless-charging is also supported but via a dedicated cover.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67961\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NYML111-428_2015_114254_high.jpg\" alt=\"lg g4\"></p><p>The phone will be available in the coming few months worldwide.

{"date": ["Jun 17, 2015"], "text": "<p>Since the time of Xbox One\u2019s somewhat subpar launch two years back, Microsoft has tried hard to make up for the lost momentum and it finally looks that the hardwork is bearing fruit. At E3 2015, the company made a number of important announcements to place its next-gen console better armed than its competitors.</p><p>The most radical announcements in the conference were about the system itself. So if you still haven\u2019t chosen your console for the next few years, Microsoft just made your decision a lot easier.</p><p>To begin with, the company is bringing your older library of 360 games to the One and if you still have those titles with you, you needn\u2019t shell out your money again. But rather than a just a straightforward revamp, the company has actually built an Xbox 360 emulator for the new system. By the holiday season, it will have brought a hundred 360 titles to the One, with plans to bring hundreds more in the future. You\u2019ll also be able to use advanced Xbox One exclusive features on those titles.</p><p>Secondly, Fallout 4 modifications made for the PC work for Xbox One too. Furthermore, Fallout 3 comes with Fallout 4 for the console. With a feature called \u2018Game Preview\u2019, you can pay to get early access to some select titles. Currently, the list tops at two games: The Long Dark and Elite Dangerous.</p><p>The ability to stream Xbox One titles to a Windows 10 PC has also arrived. Kinect games won\u2019t work now, nor would external wheels or flight sticks. You can\u2019t operate the system on a TV and laptop simultaneously either. Most of the games should work just fine with the Xbox One controller on Windows 10. The service is currently available to Xbox One Preview members. Lastly, the interface of the console is updated, from the tiled setup to a speedier arrangement with one-click accesses and Cortana.</p><p>While we sure did tell you about an updated Xbox One controller a mere week ago, Microsoft has made yet another controller, marketed as \u2018an elite controller for the elite gamer\u2019. The new $150 controller features swappable D-Pads/paddles (around back), remappable buttons and Hair Trigger Locks. This might very well be the most hackable controller ever.</p><p>Unarguably the biggest exclusive on the Xbox One just got a release date. The lives of many of us will come to a halt on October 27<sup>th</sup>, 2015.</p><p>Arguably the biggest feature this time is the massive world itself, which is four times the size of previous installations and available in its entirety on the 24-player multiplayer, dubbed \u2018Warzone\u2019. The game utilizes a new engine for the Xbox and as a result maintains a steady 60 fps everywhere, along with a major bump in graphics dept. There is a varied list of characters to choose from.</p><p>Epic world, epic battles, epic scale. This is Halo 5: Guardians.</p><p>E3 also brought with it further details on Microsoft Studios\u2019 next major racing simulator release. Forza Motorsport 6 will be released on September 15<sup>th</sup>, 2015 and features the stunning Ford GT as its major attraction.</p><p>The new game brings dynamic weather, a total of 26 tracks, 450 cars and 24-player online races. The graphics look even more mouth-watering with gorgeous trackside scenery and destructible surroundings. The numbers may sound a bit low on compared to competition but the series has always placed quality above quantity.</p><p>Possibly the most intriguing announcement was that of games featuring Microsoft\u2019s ground-breaking HoloLens technology.\u00a0 The game allows you to create your own little world in your living room with voice and gesture controls, in addition to controller support. The \u2018Air Tap\u2019 gesture which uses your index finger is also supported, as a result. More plans will be unveiled at Minecon in July.</p><p>Microsoft has announced a new partnership with Oculus to make Windows 10 \u201cthe best platform for VR gaming\u201d. Furthermore, it is working with the Oculus to make stream games from its Rift headset to Windows 10 PCs. The games will support the Xbox One controller. More on this will be revealed later.</p><p>While a remastered 1080p, 60 fps version of the original Gears of War is set to be released late August, it hasn\u2019t stopped Epic from announcing Gears of War 4 (or simply Gears 4). The game is meant to be a new start for the franchise, for Redmond\u2019s new console only.</p><p>The game features two protagonists with the cover-based mechanisms and a few truly terrible monsters. The game is set to be released in the holiday season of next year.</p><p>The sequel to 2013\u2019s Tomb Raider was announced, called the \u2018Rise of the Tomb Raider\u2019. The game will hit Xbox One and 360 systems on\u00a0<span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_189840345\"><span class=\"aQJ\">November 10, 2015</span></span>.</p>", "title": [" Roundup of the Most Important Announcements from Microsoft at E3 2015 "], "author": ["Azeem Ullah Hassan"]},

For a textile-producing country like Pakistan, the need of technological solutions that could connect and empower designers and textile mills is one of those things that just needed to be there.</p><p>This is exactly what Umainah Mendhro was thinking when she came up with Vida, an e-commerce platform that connects textile manufacturers and designers to create products such as scarves, handbags, clothing, etc. People who have a flair for design and fashion will now be able to send their designs to a textile manufacturer online, who would then in turn produce a high quality fabric using the same designs by help of a printing process..</p><p>Such a collaborative process would result in a win-win situation for both the parties, since aspiring fashion designers would be able to easily find a textile manufacturer for their wares with no hassle. An idea like this has the potential to transform the textile industry in Pakistan.</p><p><img class=\"  wp-image-71844 alignright\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/920x920.jpg\" alt=\"Umainah Mendhro\" width=\"272\" height=\"408\">Umaina Mendhro always had an eye for design, when growing up in a small village in Pakistan. She went on to build her career in Microsoft as well as the design firm West, from where she picked up invaluable lessons on how tech would prove to be instrumental in realizing her dreams.</p><p>It got her thinking about how great it would be if she decided to turn the design industry on its head, with the help of today\u2019s technology.</p><p>Her idea? Letting fashion designers send digital designs on a secure e-commerce platform to textile manufacturers, who can then print it out on any clothing article they like. All materials would be printed on high quality fabrics, making the idea more attractive for fashion designers who want to try their hand and implement their visions at scale later on.</p><p>She realized her vision with Vida, and is now partnering up with textile manufacturers all over the world, so that Vida caters to designers and manufacturers globally.</p><p>In Pakistan, Vida has partnered with one Pakistani textile manufacturer to date, with the prerequisite high quality printing equipment in place. More textile manufacturers here will be upgrading their facilities with high-tech printing presses so that they can take advantage of Vida\u2019s online platform as well.</p><p>On the global scale, Vida is winning laurels for its innovation and entrepreneurial potential, with up to $1.3 million raised from Google Ventures, Dave Morin\u2019s Slow Ventures, Universal Music Group, Nanon and Don Mattrick\u2019s Beehive Holdings, The Valley Fund, and Jesse Draper.</p><p>Vida has around 200 designers already, with about 75 items developed in 5 different product categories. All this at launch! And Vida is disrupting the traditional textile manufacturing process, with designs from its designers being processed in a matter of days.</p><p>Many famous designers like Cigdem Keskin from Turkey and Emma Lundgren from Sweden have signed up for Vida. They love how Vida is pioneering the concept of \u2018fast design.\u2019 In fact, it takes only 45 seconds to print out a scarf on high quality fabrics with the equipment that Vida wants manufacturers to install.</p><p>Vida isn\u2019t just about the designers and manufacturers only. Many of the fashion products developed on the platform can be purchased by online consumers too, with price ranging from $40 to $95 depending on the clothing and brand name.</p><p>As for Vida\u2019s business model, it works this way \u2013 designers don\u2019t need to pay anything, receiving 10% from the sales they make, with Vida taking care of the 90% that covers costs related to manufacturing, logistics, marketing, order fulfillment and more.</p><p>UImainah Mendhro has not only helped provide local manufacturers in Pakistan the means to enhance their business, but she has in the process transformed the whole global textile industry with Vida.

Only last week, it seemed as if the entire tech\u00a0community went hammering down on the computer manufacturer as computer security analysts complained that Lenovo laptops such as Yoga 2 came pre-installed with an advertising software, Superfish.</p><p>Needless to say, this left those laptops open to annoying internet advertisements no user is ever fond of. It\u2019s a shame it doesn\u2019t quite end at that and arouses much more pressing concerns.</p><p>As the scandal surfaced, what transpired is that Lenovo had an agreement with Superfish to have its software installed on Lenovo computers for a set period of time. Lenovo was to earn each time a consumer visited the feed ads on web pages put up by Superfish.</p><p>As for this adware of sorts, it simply installs its root certificate that allows it to gain entry into HTTPS web connections. This way, it forces shopping results in the web browser as users browse websites. In actuality, such invasive activities are more along the lines of spyware than adware. Trouble is that it doesn\u2019t just end at that; instead, it potentially paves way for crime.</p><p>Mike Shaver, engineering director of Facebook hinted at the MITM (Man in the middle) certificate in one of his tweets as he brought his followers\u2019 attention to the matter. MITM isn\u2019t an unusual hack; it enables \u2018foreign\u2019 parties to invade a user\u2019s network and take full control of it. The self-signed root certificate leaves the machine wide open to security breaches, allowing anyone on the same WiFi network to invade.</p><p>For instance, a hacker using the hotspot in the same caf\u00e9 as you will continue to monitor your computer\u2019s traffic. As soon as you approach the website of your bank, it will redirect you to a fictitious site by inserting new data. Whatever details you provide on that website including your password will then become a source of fresh revenue for the hacker (if you know what I mean).</p><p>Lenovo has received a volley of abuse from its loyal users ever since the news broke. People have been left absolutely flabbergasted upon learning that a company of such repute can act with such irresponsibility. The U.S government has urged users of Lenovo machines to remove Superfish from the computers and many analysts suggest steering clear of Lenovo\u2019s Windows and installing vanilla Windows instead.</p><p>Lenovo issued an apology via Twitter, admitting that the company messed up while trying to deliver on good intentions. The chief technology officer of Lenovo, Peter Hortensius refused to admit that Superfish posed any security threats that broke HTTPS connections; the company blames the way the design has been implementation instead.</p><p>Security analysts do not second that claim and point out how Lenovo was even unwilling to admit that there were associated risks with the machine at first. Lenovo is busy at work to put an end to this misery. For now, it has shared a <a href=\"http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/superfish_uninstall\" target=\"_blank\">link</a> to guide users how they can rid themselves of Superfish along with the root certificate altogether.</p><p>It\u2019s not at all surprising that Superfish wish to steer clear of the controversy as more people begin to look into it after this rousing scandal. CEO Superfish, Adi Pinhas claimed the innocence of the company in a press statement, adamant that the software is not designed to store or share any personal data.

However, what is true is that I\u2019m more dependent on Google\u2019s devices than on my PC. In fact, I use them more than anything else throughout my day, whether it is for studying, entertainment or anything else for that matter.</p><p>Lets get straight to the action. Why are we talking about this? Because Nokia has sent us a unit of its most ambitious project since the original Lumia phones, the new \u2018X\u2019. We have the device for two weeks so we can try it out as our primary phone and get a feel as to what it has to offer.</p><p>After the passage of this time, we will give a detailed conclusion as to whether the X is worthy of spending money on. Will Nokia challenge the domination of Samsung in my household? Will I buy a Nokia X at the end of the journey for myself?</p><p>I have already been using it for two days, and here are my first impressions.</p><p>The design of this phone is more or less the same as Nokia\u2019s Asha line. The bold colors are obviously a major attraction but I really liked the backs which cover the entire phone. However, the X is definitely bulkier than I thought it would be.</p><p>The display was a huge surprise. Having used the Asha 500 and despised its pitiable quality, my expectations were quite low. It kind of blew me away.</p><p>It is a vivid 4\u2033 panel pumped with colors. Its WVGA resolution gives it the same pixel density as the original Galaxy S and It looks better than you would expect. It\u2019s not perfect, though, as the screen has its own share of peculiar issues, the sensitivity, for one.</p><p>I have been using a Samsung phone and a Nexus tablet for the past few years as my primary devices, I am now accustomed to touching the display with any part of my finger tip in every bizarre way; this can\u2019t really happen with the X.</p><p>In the Fastlane, forget about pressing the small \u201cx\u201d which cancel an on-going download.

Anyhow, this is the simplest smartphone I\u2019ve used in ages, even when you include the Asha smartphones.</p><p>The single physical key at the front (like an iPhone) makes this phone utterly simple. (Trust me, I\u2019ve asked many people to use this phone, tech savvy or not, they all managed it well.)</p><p>Pressing the button takes you to the back screen, while holding the button will take you to the menu; pressing it from there takes you to the Fastlane. The entire process is simple and it works.</p><p>The OS, however, is not faultless. It has glitches, minor and major, plus some things which I don\u2019t think should really exist; not with Nokia.</p><p>I won\u2019t go into much detail here but the keyboard for one can be painful to use in apps; and low RAM issues might hit you in the face if you are a hardcore user.</p><p>Nokia has pre-installed its own store in the phone instead of Google Play. As you would expect, there are no Google services, either in the phone or in the store.</p><p>The store is reasonable, taking into consideration its recent birth. Still, considering it takes developers only two hours\u00a0to port apps to it, why so many major names are missing.</p><p>A refuge is certainly to be found in the form of third-party stores, many of which are to be found in the pre-installed store.

Such data is typically stored on an iOS device, and is used by major apps like Facebook and Twitter in order to find out what ads are relevant for each consumer.</p><p>On a fundamental level, Apple is trying to put an end to the use of an application programming interface (API) called \u201ccanopenURL\u201d, which apps frequently exploit in order to deliver targeted ads. The company finds this similar to the exploitation of the user history in your web browser. Let\u2019s suppose you tend to download a lot of music-related apps. Through \u201ccanopenURL\u201d, it would be possible for an advertiser to show you an ad for another music app that you don\u2019t yet have on your iPhone or iPad.</p><p>With iOS 9, Apple has made it clear that it takes the privacy of its users very seriously. The new operating system will also have the benefit of providing Apple with greater control over when and where advertisements are displayed on its devices. The Safari browser will also receive a privacy-centric overhaul, with more advanced ad-blocking features that will allow iPhone and iPad users to block advertisements.</p><p>While the new policy is indeed beneficial for user privacy, it comes as a huge blow for advertisers who have been exploiting the API for monetary gains. It\u2019s also likely to spell trouble for free apps, which are primarily reliant on revenue generated from advertisements.</p><p>Advertisers are still likely to find other means to extract the same information regarding the app preferences of consumers, but the privacy-oriented iOS 9 will certainly make it less easier for them to do so.

That is why cardboard VR headsets, which provide a great way to experience VR, are a welcome development.</p><p>Originally kickstarted by Google Cardboard, these VR headsets are a low cost way to encourage development and interest in VR. You simply download the schematics (link at the end) and build it yourself or you can buy a pre-made one for cheap. It\u2019s one of these ready-to-go headsets that we\u2019ll be reviewing today.</p><p>Sold by an online store called\u00a0Bytes.pk, I\u00a0got a chance to try out\u00a0the Bytes VR Core 5.7 model and used it with an Sony Xperia Z3.

This one concept simply blew up and spurred a lot of development.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-69539\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Fotor_143246430303187-700x729.jpeg\" alt=\"Fotor_143246430303187\"></p><p>For our VR headset, assembly is pretty easy. It took me ten minutes to get it ready. The main elements are the two professional lenses attached in the pack, which allow 3D immersion. There is also a magnet switch to allow the control of the Google cardboard app.</p><p>The cardboard is designed in such a way that it employs the natural bisecting vision (line of sight) of our eyes and creates a cinematic virtual reality environment, Seeing inside of it with a smartphone allows for real-time cinema-like visualization.</p><p>The Google cardboard app can be downloaded from Play Store for free. This independent application also allows us to download more VR specific applications. Once our phone is fit into the VR headset box, the only control outside is the magnet switch which uses our smartphone\u2019s magnetometer (built into every phone as a compass).</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-69543\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Fotor_143246479340518-700x455.jpeg\" alt=\"Fotor_143246479340518\"></p><p>The enjoyment involves starting any VR capable app with the phone inside the cardboard and tilting our head left, right, up and down \u2013 so the scenery also moves accordingly. So moving my head towards the left direction will move the scenery on its right (as if I were tilting my head in real). The same movements apply to the virtual emphasis that the headset provides to us.</p><p>I started off my experience with an app named \u2018An Unseen Sky VR\u2019. It\u00a0starts in a forest area with birds chirping and a natural scene set around us. The sound is really soothing and touchy. Moving our head actually allows us to see everything in the forest. As the scene moves forward, we enter a cave with a wolf and go past through it into a raining garden where the journey actually ends. It was a good experience as a starter.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-69535\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Fotor_14324651069404-700x493.jpeg\" alt=\"Fotor_14324651069404\"></p><p>Then there is the \u2018VR Cinema app\u2019 which runs any video file into split screen 3D mode just like we see in a cinema. Plus this one also has the ability to use our phone camera as the real view-finder! So we need to turn the camera on and we can actually see through the camera while walking forward or back. I bumped into my room\u2019s walls once because of trying this, so precaution is recommended!</p><p>Then there was this \u2018Insidious 3 VR app\u2019 which takes us into a 3D room with a lady telling us not to be afraid. And while she talks, the door bangs, the windows break, the table rumbles\u2026 and at that moment I stopped the app because I was seriously frightened!

It is a joyride in between a city with tall buildings. Once we tilt our head towards the right, the ride starts up, and no words can describe how many times I felt like it was\u00a0really happening to me!</p><p>For the price, this really is amazing technology.\u00a0Entertainment is the main aim of the VR game and my experience was very positive.

Such SIM is called dormant and is usually not counted\u00a0as a subscription.</p><p>As we know\u00a0that there were 103 Million SIMs selected for the re-verification purpose. These 103 Million SIMs were picked from the pool of active SIMs at the time of start of re-verification drive.</p><p>However, when re-verification started, dormant SIMs \u2014 even if they were decade old numbers that were in-active for ages\u00a0\u2014 started appearing\u00a0against CNICs of customers.</p><p>So it was a blessing in disguise for cellular operators as mobile phone users were offered to re-verify all the numbers registered against CNICs and this is\u00a0how dormant SIMs started getting re-verified.</p><p>It merits mentioning here that as per <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/01/16/pta-issues-official-sops-sim-reverification/\" target=\"_blank\">SOP for re-verification of SIMs</a>, customers had to re-verify their one primary number for each operator and in return system sent a\u00a0list of all registered numbers against the CNIC in an SMS.

From the little improvements in display of the last year\u2019s model to premium construction and impressively long battery life, Dell pleasantly surprises one and all with this beauty.</p><p>If you thought the previous Dell XPS variant had amazingly small bezel, this one nearly blows out the very existence of what little remained of that bezel. It\u2019s barely noticeable at 5.2mm on the sides and the top of the screen. This leaves users with a lot more screen estate, potentially making the laptop seem as if it belongs in the attire of an 11-inch machine.</p><p>Besides the variant with a Full HD display, Dell will offer an optional version with what Dell terms the UltraSharp Quad HD+ Inifinity display. To simplify this for you, the latter sports a 3200\u00d71800 resolution touchscreen display. The term \u2018Infinity\u2019 stands for the impressive 400 nits of brightness that this variant possesses. Surely, display features such as that would help Dell take on the mighty Apple Mackbook Air.</p><p><img class=\" size-large wp-image-61961 aligncenter\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-3-700x502.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled-3\"></p><p>Dell XPS 13 is awfully similar to its predecessor in regards to its premium build quality. The carbon fibre and machined aluminum construction not only contributes to that suave look but also keeps the weight considerably less at 2.8 pounds. Thanks again to that edge-to-edge display, the laptop feels significantly compact and easy to carry around.</p><p>Dell offers a precision trackpad and also incorporates a glass button. It seems like Dell finally paid heed to Microsoft\u2019s call to implement such trackpads. Afterall, it\u2019s these precision trackpads that offer intuitive features like gresture support and multi-touch with Windows 8.1. The execution by Dell in this matter is superb with top-notch tactile quality. Thus, scrolling and zooming is an absolute treat. The fully backlit chiclet keyboard doesn\u2019t quite match the quality of Mackbook Air\u2019s with shallow key travel and keys on the smaller side. However, it\u2019s a sacrifice many would be willing to put up with.</p><p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-61960 aligncenter\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/xps_01.jpg\" alt=\"dell xps 13\"></p><p>Dell has settled with the fresh, fith generation of Intel Core i processors for this lineup. They range from 2.1GHz Core i3 for the entry level model right upto the Core i7 variant. Users have the option to opt for either 4GB or 8GB of RAM. Storage offered is either 128GB SSD with the Full HD versions and 256GB for the one with Quad HD+ display.</p><p>Compact size was always going to be a bargain for something, right? Well, it translates in the limited connectivity options. It\u2019s not too bad, though. Dell XPS 13 comes equipped with a Mini DisplayPort, typical audio jacks two USB 3.0 ports and one SD card slot.</p><p><img class=\" size-large wp-image-61963 aligncenter\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dell-xps-13-700x467.png\" alt=\"dell-xps-13\"></p><p>Dell XPS 13 of old was a huge disappointment in terms of battery life but that\u2019s bound to change this time around. The latest version promises 15 hours long battery life for the Full HD version. Dell claims that the variant sporting Quad HD+ display will last for a total of 12 hours.</p><p>If you feel your laptop might still run short on juice, Dell plans to separately sell a 1,200mAh Power Companion that could add another 6 to 10 hours. Though, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019d need the battery extension considering how efficiently the Sharp IGZO display and Intel Broadwell processor manage power on this machine.</p><p>Dell XPS 13 will be up for grabs in the US from today onwards with international rollout expected later on. The Core i3 base model retails for $799 whereas the 3.0GHz Core i7 variant sporting the QHD+ display, 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM would set you back by $1,899. In between the two is one equipped with 2.2GHz Core i5 (Turbo Boost), 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD, priced at $999.</p>", "title": [" Dell XPS 13: Macbooks Finally Have a Worthy Contender "], "author": ["Hassan Aftab"]},

Stopwatches and pedometers have always been an essential part of an athlete or a fitness instructor\u2019s armory. With the advent of the smartphone and fitness tracking wristbands, it was only a matter of time before we could use our watches, wristbands and smartphones for fitness monitoring and coaching.</p><p>In 2012, the market for fitness tracking and monitoring really took off. Some of the innovations that we see today are marvelous especially if you are a fitness enthusiast and would love to keep a record of your activity levels.</p><p>Nike has always been the trailblazer when it comes to fitness. They were one of the pioneers of integrating activity monitoring when they partnered with Apple, with the Nike+Ipod sensor, followed by the Nike FuelBand. Now discontinued, the Nike FuelBand (available in Pakistan) was all about motivation.</p><p>With Nike\u2019s partnership with Apple going from strength to strength they have moved away from producing hardware to focus on improving user experience through better and smoother applications. Utilizing the greatly improved accelerometers and motion sensing capabilities of the new iPhone, Nike introduced its Nike+Running app, my current favorite. Nike+Running app has a great interface displaying your number of runs, distance and average pace accurately no matter whether you are running outdoors or on the treadmill.</p><p>With Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest integrated you get to share your workout with your friends and other running enthusiasts around the globe. It\u2019s been a great motivator for me and I would suggest that if you are planning to adopt a healthy lifestyle definitely give this app a try. Nike+Running is available for free for both android and iOS.</p><p>Nike\u2019s wearables have other competitors such as UP by jawbone (available in Pakistan). Jawbone Up not only keeps a track of all your activities but also your sleep, it provides you data which enables you to adopt a healthier daily routine. Jawbone works with a multitude of apps such as Runkeeper, Myfitnesspal and Strava amongst others. Though Jawbone has been a huge hit among the fitness enthusiasts, there has been criticism about its sleep tracking feature and battery life. If I have choice between UP Jawbone and Nike Fuelband, I would opt for the latter.</p><p>Writing about fitness wearable and smartphones, how can we leave out Samsung Gear which according to industry experts is currently the market leader when it comes to wearables, as it successfully blends the features of a smart watch and a fitness tracker.</p><p>Samsung is followed by Fitbit \u2013 with its clip-on One or the Charge Fitbit is the wearable of choice for many. Even if you don\u2019t own a Fitbit device do try the Fitbit app (free with in-app purchases. Available for iOS and Android). The wearables market is going to heat-up with the Apple Watch rumored to be coming out in early spring 2015 coupled with Ihealth feature and Nike+Running on iPhone. The wearables market is estimated to generate revenue of over $53 billion by 2019.</p><p>On the other end of the fitness tech segment are the fitness apps such as:</p><p>While these and a lot more fitness apps are being produced, smartphones are still not the first choice when it comes to tracking and monitoring fitness. More and more people are turning towards wearables to enhance their workout experiences.</p><p>We believe wearables are currently in the same phase as cellphones were right before the smartphone. Wearables will be taking a huge leap in the next couple of years, with a lot more imagination and innovation. The next generation of wearables have to utilize the real world and the user\u2019s environment as its operating system, something that Google is also majorly investing in.</p>", "title": [" 2014: Year of Fitness Devices and Apps "], "author": ["Jahanban Tahir"]},

Unlike previous tablets from Dany, this device features an IPS screen which provides sharp and vivid colors with decent viewing angles.</p><p>However, there are some vertical bars visible on the screen, and these could be very irritating at times.

Other than that I would recommend you to use Nova/Apex launcher with Dany T500 as the default launcher doesn\u2019t feature multi-tasking menu.</p><p>There is no word on the availability of future updates, which means you are stuck with the same version of Android and can\u2019t upgrade to more recent versions like Android 4.4 KitKat, unless you opt to root the device.</p><p>Rooting this tablet is very easy and you can do it with one click by using Root Genius, or similar applications, but keep in mind rooting the device will void your warranty.</p><p>Dany T500 is packed with a reasonably powerful MediaTek MT8382 quad-core processor, clocked at 1.3GHz, along with Mali-400 GPU and 1GB of RAM.</p><p>Dany T500 features 16GB internal memory and you can use a microSD card up to 32GB.</p><p>Swiping of screens and the normal operation of Dany T500 is satisfactory and you won\u2019t feel any lag; unless you run some resource hungry applications.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50798\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bench-1.jpg\" alt=\"bench-1\" width=\"720\" height=\"384\"></p><p>In my tests, opening a couple of resource hungry applications sometimes left the tablet unresponsive. It might be a software glitch because otherwise it handles the applications very well.</p><p>You can enjoy the latest 3D games without any visible delay and it can play high-definition videos without any hiccups, but there is some problem with YouTube and other video streaming applications. The sound comes before the video and it seems pixelated.</p><p>You can use two SIM cards with\u00a0Dany T500\u00a0and both SIMs are 3G compatible. The regular and VoIP call experience is good and by default it puts you on loudspeaker during a call.</p><p>Dany T500 is equipped with a 3000mAh non-removable battery, which at maximum provides you a single day usage. Previously I have reviewed <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2014/03/03/dany-tab-g5-wip/\" target=\"_blank\">Genius G5</a>, which had a smaller battery but it had decent backup. May be it is because Dany T500\u00a0has a bigger screen and a different SoC.</p><p>How long you can keep Dany T500\u00a0going really depends on what you do with it but for most of the users it will provide a single day usage. Power users might need to charge it multiple times a day.</p><p>You can always preserve and extend the battery timings by lowering the brightness to minimum and by turning off Wi-Fi/3G when not needed.</p><p>It takes almost 2.5 hours to fully charge the battery and you can also use your laptop/computer, or any other device that supports OTG, to charge Dany T500.</p><p>Dany T500 features a primary 8-megapixel auto-focus camera with single LED flash and a secondary 0.3 megapixel camera for video calling.</p><p>The performance of front-facing camera is extremely poor as expected, on the other hand primary camera does the job well, especially in well-lit conditions.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-50788\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/t500-camera.jpg\" alt=\"t500-camera\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></p><p>The primary camera allows you to record 720p videos, whereas the front camera is restricted to just 480p.</p><p>The performance of the primary 8-megapixel camera is acceptable but the poor quality front-facing camera is a deal breaker.</p><p>In the #Selfie age, front facing camera has become more important, also the video calling requires a decent camera.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-50800\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/camera.jpg\" alt=\"camera\" width=\"720\" height=\"450\"></p><p>The camera interface is quite simple and allows you to control certain aspects, like exposure, white balance, face-detection, HDR, panorama, image and video size.</p><p>You can also apply some filters and effects on the still images and videos.

You can <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/04/29/exclusive-pakistan-left-with-121-8-million-active-sims/\" target=\"_blank\">check\u00a0detailed results of SIM reverification by clicking this link</a>.</p><p>If all un-verified SIMs are blocked \u2014 then\u00a0how come illegal voice exchanges are still\u00a0operating in full swing?</p><p>We\u00a0know that illegal voice exchanges use hundreds of SIMs per exchange and those SIMs are impossible to get re-verified. Hence they were suppose to get blocked after the deadline \u2014 putting an end to illegal exchanges.</p><p>However, that\u2019s not the case. PTA and FIA in-fact raided two exchanges just past week. Below is scree-grab of the official PR on the raid:</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67903\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/PTA_Raid.jpg\" alt=\"PTA_Raid\"></p><p>ProPakistani has details of few numbers that were never verified by their users but\u00a0those un-verified numbers are still operating normally, even after the deadline.</p><p>It merits mentioning here that all these numbers (that are un-verified but still active) are extremely\u00a0high revenue generating SIMs.</p><p>If we\u00a0suppose that high-revenue generating SIMs are still not blocked and\u00a0cellular companies are dodging the regulator then all the\u00a0SIMs used by illegal exchanges are\u00a0bound to be high-revenue generating SIMs and they are never going to get blocked.</p><p>Similarly, in such a case, those fraudsters that send fake lottery SMS or Benazir Income Support messages are going to live forever.</p><p>Telecom companies, when asked about the issue, said that all un-verified SIMs are blocked. They said that data of verified and blocked SIMs\u00a0has been shared with PTA and only PTA will make these stats public.</p><p>Apparently they didn\u2019t know anything further.</p><p>PTA thinks that the matter of un-verified SIMs need a proper conclusion. It said that they want to make sure that this whole issue is never revived again and for this they want Ministry of Interior to audit the data along with PTA officials.</p><p>PTA said that this audit report will settle all\u00a0doubts\u00a0and that\u00a0no one\u00a0should worry about any in-appropriations.</p><p>It won\u2019t be out of place to mention here that audit team is yet not formed \u2014 even after 15 days of completion of re-verification drive.</p><p>Unless you live under a rock, you must be familiar that all cellular networks are operated with computers. And they take just few clicks in blocking (millions of) SIMs, re-activating them\u00a0or counting them all.</p><p>If so, then why such\u00a0delays in\u00a0announcing the re-verification results?</p><p>Not to mention, in\u00a0ad-hoc press briefings \u2014 during the re-verification drive \u2014 PTA used to communicate up-to-date re-verification results on day to day basis, meaning that they had all the telcos\u2019\u00a0data communicated to them in real time.</p><p>Then why\u00a0it is now taking them forever to announce the results?</p><p>We just hope that millions of dollars and countless work hours of Pakistanis won\u2019t just get wasted.</p><p>You can share your thoughts below!</p><p>We just have been told\u00a0that <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/04/28/deadline-for-sim-re-verification-extended-again-till-may-15th-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">deadline for re-verification of SIMs has been extended till May 15th, 2015</a>. This was decided during a high-level meeting chaired by Ch. Nisar, Interior Minister.</p><p>This proves that our above suspicions were just on the mark and the corporates \u2014 in hands with PTA and Ministry of Interior \u2014 \u00a0fouled the whole nation again.</p>", "title": [" Results of SIM Re-Verification Drive Get Suspicious "], "author": ["Aamir Attaa"]},

NBP\u2019s existing presence in the agriculture and retail sectors can be leveraged to take advantage of this opportunity for emancipating the small businessmen, armed forces and retired employees.</p><p>He also added that various surveys show in the unorganized lending sector the borrowers are burdened with high lending rates and excessive requirements on collateral and guarantees exist, resulting in supply-side barriers that are likely to negatively affect the growth of SMEs and serve as the most serious barriers to accessing financial institutions.</p><p>Mr. Kazmi added that backed by a strong banking expertise and an in-depth knowledge of the emerging socio-economic markets, and driven by a deep and compassionate understanding of the poverty factor, National Bank of Pakistan along with its various corporate alliances is fully prepared to offer viable answers to how poverty can be alleviated and optimistically reduced in the near future through the success of PMYBL scheme.</p><p>He said that the formation of alliance with Ufone would lead to the availability of funds to the borrowers of the scheme at the convenience of their neighborhood and SME financing will assist in secured provision of funds for their enhancing of existing or developing of new small businesses.</p><p>Thanks to the leadership role played by State Bank of Pakistan by being a progressive and dynamic regulator, Pakistan is one of the fastest growing financial services markets all over the world.

The only major distinction with the traditional apps is that the new ones require initiation by the user unlike the former that would run in the background.</p><p>The Do Button wades into the Internet of Things territory and allows you to control smart devices with a single touch.

The full Visual Studio is still Windows only though, but releasing a cross platform editor shows Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2015/02/20/5-reasons-why-microsoft-is-becoming-cool-again/\" target=\"_blank\">new strategy for supporting other platforms</a>.</p><p>Visual Studio Code is quite different from the otherwise similarly named Visual Studio. It\u00a0is lighter and designed for code editing only while the complete Visual Studio remains a much larger Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which consists of everything from form editors to database integration. Microsoft\u2019s Corporate VP of its Developer Division stated:</p><p>Visual Studio Code gives\u00a0developers built-in multi-language support and the editor will feature rich code assistance and navigation for JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js and ASP.NET. The editor includes all the code editing tools expected from a modern editor including syntax highlighting, customisable keyboard bindings, snippets and bracket matching. The editor also works with Git without any additional hassle though portable versions of Git are not currently supported.</p><p>The new editor is based on Microsoft\u2019s experience with the online Monaco editor. Microsoft announced that Roselyn project, Microsoft\u2019s .NET platform and language services built for the Visual Studio Code will become available for other editors like Atom, Sublime Text and Vi as well. In an effort to support developers with their current editor tools, Microsoft launched a TypeScript plug-in for Sublime Text and Somasegar has implied that the company will stay committed to launching similar projects in the future as well.</p><p>These set of announcements were quite surprising but they do seem to be according to the company\u2019s new direction undertaken by the <a href=\"http://propakistani.pk/2014/02/04/microsoft-names-indian-born-satya-nadella-as-its-new-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\">CEO Satya Nadella</a>.

The release of the Blackberry Classic is a throwback to what made the company popular in the first place and is sure to please loyalists.</p><p>On first look, old BlackBerry users would immediately be able to tell that BlackBerry Classic closely resembles\u00a0the BlackBerry Bold. The return of the physical QWERTY keyboard and square trackpad,\u00a0surrounded by four navigation keys, would surely appeal to those fans and might as well attract\u00a0new audience to the BlackBerry 10 OS.</p><p>As you\u2019d expect from BlackBerry, the physical keyboard\u00a0looks and feels brilliant. The keys lighting up in dark environments is a nice touch. The inroduction\u00a0of new keyboard shortcuts is equally pleasing. The buttons protrude ever so slightly, allowing\u00a0users to tell them apart while typing. However, unlike the curved keyboard with curved frets on the\u00a0BlackBerry Bold 9900, this one accommodates slim and straight bars between every row.</p><p><img class=\" size-large wp-image-60969 aligncenter\" src=\"http://propakistani.pk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/215-700x500.jpg\" alt=\"2\"></p><p>Make no mistake, BlackBerry not only comes across as a sturdy device but is also a looker.\u00a0Slightly raised brushed steel bezel on the smartphone gives the phone a nice, premium look and\u00a0also tones down any damage from accidental drops.</p><p>It has a 3.5\u00adinch LCD display (720p resolution at 290\u00a0ppi) with Corning Gorilla Glass 3. At 180 grams, BlackBerry Classic definitely feels a lot heavier than usual. It\u2019s gotta be said,\u00a0though, that even weight distribution thoughout the phone ensures that the Classic doesn\u2019t feel\u00a0too heavy on one end.</p><p>16GB of internal storage may leave more to be desired but BlackBerry has you covered\u00a0with the option to expand memory up to 128GB. A couple of brushed steel slots on the side are\u00a0homes to the micro SD card and a nano SIM card.</p><p>BlackBerry users would be aware that these\u00a0could be found inside the battery doors on previous BlackBerry devices. However, unremovable\u00a0battery on BlackBerry Classic leaves no room for that this time around. Speaking of battery, the\u00a02,515mAh package truly impresses with nearly 22 hours of moderate use.</p><p>1.5GHz Dual\u00adcore processor coupled with 2GB of RAM help run the most demanding apps\u00a0available on the BlackBerry 10 OS. The 8MP camera with LED flash\u00a0along with 2MP\u00a0front\u00ad-facing camera works significantly better in broad daylight than in\u00a0darker environments. If you aren\u2019t too crazy about taking high quality photos with a smartphone\u00a0camera, this would be far from being a deal breaker.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to infer that BlackBerry Classic is more or less a fan service. This is not even remotely an\u00a0attempt to outdo the existing rivals in the smartphone industry. Instead, the idea is to retain loyal\u00a0customers in the mix. Judging by how much it has to offer, BlackBerry Classic could very well\u00a0deliver on that front.

As all online sales are ultimately reverted\u00a0to the dollar and euro, Apple realized\u00a0that it could potentially find itself in a situation where the prices of products would be changing on an\u00a0hourly basis, and therefore could stand to make massive losses.</p><p>Analysts have admitted that the\u00a0Cupertino based company was left with little choice and that it was the right\u00a0economic decision to\u00a0halt sales until the currency stabilized.

It weighs 318 grams and with a width of 6.9mm, it\u2019s lighter and thinner than the\u00a0iPad Mini.</p><p>Under the hood, it\u2019s powered by the new Intel Atom processor Z3580 processor that clocks in at 2.4GHz.

Why not build a device that is also built on the same principles as being super simple and easy to use and elegant?\u201d</p><p>The N1 tablet\u00a0will be available\u00a0in two colors: \u2018Natural Aluminum\u2019 and \u2018Lava Grey\u2019, and will cost $249 plus tax. It is expected to become available in China in mid February and make its way to selected markets after that.</p><p>If you remember, Nokia sold it\u2019s devices and business units to Microsoft around 7 months ago for $7.2 billion. Fortunately for Nokia, Microsoft has\u00a0decided to go forward with the\u00a0Lumia brand for their Windows Phone devices. So the real Nokia are free to use their brand name for future devices. They still can\u2019t sell any smartphones under their name until 2016 as part of the\u00a0deal but tablets aren\u2019t covered by the agreement.</p><p>The company has also announced that it will\u00a0go back into the smartphone arena indirectly through licensing after 2016. With the release of the N1 Android tablet, we\u2019ve got an early taste of that strategy. Foxconn are building the tablet and they have licensed the Nokia brand name. The N1 is expected to be the first of many such products under similar\u00a0agreements.</p><p>Concerns about brand dilution are valid but\u00a0Ramzi Haidamus, Nokia\u2019s technology chief, says that the bar for licencing rights is set very high. In an interview with FT, he\u00a0added that the N1 was a product of Nokia\u2019s industrial design team and the company had full control over design quality. What this all means is that the\u00a0Nokia devices we are seeing today will bear little resemblance to future\u00a0products. It also pretty much guarantees that we will see an Android powered smartphone bearing the familiar Nokia moniker\u00a0at some point in time.</p>", "title": [" Nokia Launches Android Powered N1 Tablet "], "author": ["Syed Talal"]},

Current lithium-ion batteries are what they are comparing their new tech with.</p><p>First a little bit of technical information about li-ion batteries. These batteries rely on graphite-based anodes for dispersing positive electric charge. These anodes, due to their physical characteristics, hold a limited amount of charge. In numbers, lithium-ion has an energy density of less than 600watts-hour per liter.</p><p>Energy is looking to replace the current-graphite based anode with an ultra-thin metal anode that gives 1,200 wH/L. IN theory that\u2019s double the charge from current LI-Ion batteries. The ultra-thin anode is made from a thin piece of lithium on copper. And whats more, it\u2019s one-fifth the size of a graphite anode, meaning that not only does it hold 2x the charge, but it does by occupying less physical space.</p><p>In theory our future smartphones that come with SolidEnergy\u2019s batteries will have significantly tiny batteries, thanks to a shrunken battery compartment. Imagine how much lighter our phones will be. Imagine how many more features manufacturers can cram in their phones now that they have more space to design their phones.</p><p>SolidEnergy\u2019s tech will be demonstrated in Google\u2019s modular phones (Project Ara). This makes sense as these modular phones will have tiny and replaceable components that can be switched out. According to SolidEnergy\u2019s founder and current CEO Dr. Qichao Hu, his battery tech sounds practical and custom-tailored for Google\u2019s unique take on smartphones.</p><p>Google was trying to figure out the short battery life on its Project Ara prototypes and SolidEnergy\u2019s battery tech can adequately power all manner of different components that modular smartphones will possess.</p><p>If all goes well, we will be seeing SolidEnergy\u2019s battery in 2015. Dr, Hu has mentioned that many smartphone manufacturers have also approached him for the technology.

That\u2019s because Google has had QUIC support added to the more recent versions of Google Chrome and you\u2019ve been testing it for them. Google believes that it has the potential to speed up browsing which is why it\u2019s being proposed to Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p><p>The mnemonic \u2018QUIC\u2019 stands for Quick UDP Internet Connection. The experimental implementation is a low latency internet protocol which facilitates VoIP services, streaming services and online gaming over UDP. As opposed to it\u2019s counterpart TCP, UDP is known to be lightweight in comparsion. This is balanced out with TCP offering a lot more error correction services, though.</p><p>On the usual TCP connection, atleast a couple of round trips are needed before your browser begins to receive data. It\u2019s different with QUIC in the sense that the browser responds to the server in no time. Two new added features make it even better than pure UDP. These include: automatic retransmission and congestion control. Congestion control is expected to significantly improve load times for those on slower connections.</p><p>This is especially great news for all those who are into online gaming. Ideally, gamers require low overheads such that the latency can be reduced to the bare minimum. Even if the server is unable to pick the latest mouse click, the player doesn\u2019t have squander any more time to remedy that lost second or two since the action continues to progress.</p><p>That could have been an option if TCP support wasn\u2019t directly built into the OS kernels. Since Google has absolutely no control over those, it resorts to experimenting with QUIC instead. It does wish that the features sported by QUIC will prove enough effective to be eventually ported to TCP.</p><p>Google has reported that so far a 3 percent improvement in mean page load time on Google Search has been recorded while using QUIC. Before you begin to think that sounds far from impressive, bear in mind the fact that Google Search is quite effectively optimized in its current state. Improvements with latency-heavy apps and websites will be more noticeable.

Afterall, we all benefit from the resources present in this world and it is a moral duty to reciprocate that favour in the best way we possibly can.</p><p>What better way to accomplish that than using modern day technology to your advantage? Global Innovation Through Science &amp; Technology (GIST) Tech-I competition is a great platform to bring such ideas to light and get rewarded for your efforts at the same time.</p><p>GIST is an initiative of the U.S. Department of State that has been set up to empower the youth to tackle development and economic issues. This is made possible with mentoring, skill building exercises, financial aid and networking assistance. Online programs, startup boot camps and competitions arranged under GIST since 2011 have helped accomplish that across 86 developing economies.</p><p>A key part of GIST, Tech-I is an annual competition that invites young entrepreneurs, scientists and inventors to channel their ideas or startups that can change the world for the better. These ideas could potentially address issues linked with the environment, health, ICT, energy or conservation.</p><p>GIST continues to highlight winners from the past during the application process to motivate the applicants. Ever since its inception, Tech-I has had winners especially from all across Asia, Africa and Middle East. Last year\u2019s winners include: David Gluckman (South Africa), Mixon Faluweki (Kenya), Nermin Sa\u2019d (Jordan), Jolene Sim (Malaysia), Tonee Ndungu (Kenya) and Ziad Sankari (Lebanon).

{"date": ["Feb 24, 2015"], "text": "<p>We in Pakistan are all quite familiar with the word Drone. At the first utterance of it our minds will usually go to the controversial bombings in Waziristan, but warfare is only one aspect of the massive potential drones possess. Drones are being tipped to bring about a sea of change in our private and commercial lives.</p><p>Commercial and personal drones are small GPS enabled flying machines that can be controlled through sophisticated remote controls for accomplishing various flying tasks. The avenues of utilizing drone technology are massive and drones could be a game changer for many industries. Aviation regulators around the globe want to ensure safety prior to allowing commercial use of drones.</p><p>Once the rules are in place we could see drones filling the skies especially in the USA. Their potential use as delivery machines is being explored in depth by companies such as Amazon. Its \u201coctocopters\u201d drones as part of its \u201cAmazon Prime Air\u201d project will be able to deliver any product at your doorstep within 30 minutes of your purchase.</p><p>Then there are companies such Flirtey selling textbooks in Australia which claim to have an even advanced mechanism of delivery through drones. \u00a0According to industry experts with the American Federal Aviation Authority looking into regulating the airspace for drones, it is not a question of if but rather how soon can companies begin cutting on costs and delivery time by utilizing drones. There are concerns of drones replacing humans in the delivery business but the postman will never be out of work as there is a limit to the weight drones can carry and deliver safely.</p><p>Safety is the regulators biggest concern when it comes to commercial drones; drones have to be safe for planes, birds and should not be falling out of the sky on people, their homes or cars. While the American regulators are still working on a policy, Australians have allowed the use of commercial drones to capture sports events, photography and for search and rescue services such as spraying chemicals to extinguish bushfires. Delivery via drones in Australia is also expected to be allowed soon.</p><p>The use of drones will not be limited to delivery services, already experts are exploring multiple facets of drone technology ranging from spraying pesticides at farms to monitoring electricity power cables especially in remote areas. \u00a0While directors in Hollywood are experimenting with newer perspectives they can explore to shoot films by using camera mounted drones. Other innovative use drones are for exploring new places such as MIT using it to show people around it campus.</p><p>We in Pakistan are also not too far behind in the game. In 2014 all of us witnessed a race for capturing the best moments of huge political gatherings by various TV channels and in doing so they started utilizing camera mounted drones. While these \u201cNews Drones\u201d did give us a brand new perspectives on the jalsas and rallies safety concerns were raised by the organizers of the rallies and law enforcement agencies regarding the safety of the crowd these drones were hovering over.</p><p>There were also instances of law enforcement agencies banning the use of drones by the media at various gatherings. Very little is being done in terms of regulations and legislations when it comes to commercial drone usage in Pakistan, but guess the regulators have a lot more on their plates plus the usage is also at a minimal.</p><p>The prices for a commercial sized drone have really gone down and all thanks to the advancement in smart phone technology magnetometers, gyros, batteries, cameras, accelerometers, radios, GPS modules, and processors have all become smaller in size and their prices have drastically dropped.</p><p>The most important aspect for buying your own is durability as all enthusiasts who might have tried their hands on model airplanes or RC helicopters would know that you tend to crash them a lot when you are the learning how to fly them.</p><p>In case you are interested in getting your hands on a commercial drone for yourself it would cost you somewhere between $3,000 to $600, the ones being used by the media in Pakistan (those with Green and Red blinking lights that would come ever so close to the stage to capture close-ups of Bilawal or Imran Khan in their jalsas/dharnas) are DJI Phantom 2s with built-in GPS to keep them stable during high winds. You can buy a Phantom from $1,299 to $679 depending on whether you would want one with a built-in camera or own a separate attachable Go Pro camera.</p><p>On the other hand hobbyist drones being offered on Amazon can cost from $100 to as low as $25. Yes you can get your hands on the palm sized Proto Nano X for $25. These drones come with built-in cameras and depending on the model they can record videos on micro SD cards or relay Live video to your smartphones which can be attached to the remotes.</p><p>The cheaper drones are great for indoor use but are not reliable in windy outdoor conditions. Also almost all drones are battery guzzlers but with time and regulators allowing use of commercial drones more investment is expected to pour into drone development and battery time surly wouldn\u2019t be an issue.</p><p>Drones are sure to give us a new high and the advent of the drone age is not too distant.</p>", "title": [" Advent of the Drone Age: What Does the Future Hold?

There is good reason for that; these highly affordable smartphones fare better than most\u00a0budget phones out there. And with the new year, Xiaomi seems to have kick-started things with the\u00a0successor to its first\u00a0Redmi 1S smartphone, the Redmi 2.</p><p>As you would expect from a budget smartphone, Redmi 2 has sufficient mid-range specifications on\u00a0offer. A 4.7-inch 720p IPS display with a pixel density of 312ppi would please most budget phone\u00a0owners. Visual experience would less likely be disrupted with odd fluctuations, thanks to the\u00a0incorporation of color temperature adjustment. At 133 grams and with a width of 9.4mm, it sure does\u00a0feel compact.</p><p>Xiaomi Redmi 2 comes equipped with a 1.2GHz Quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor\u00a0coupled with 1GB of RAM. This may not be the best combination but it is expected to handle most\u00a0operations without a hitch. 8GB of internal storage would accommodate a good amount of your\u00a0content. Should the phone run out of memory, there is always the option to expand upto 32GB using a\u00a0microSD card.</p><p>For the photographers, the 8 megapixels rear camera along with the\u00a02 megapixels front-facing snapper should suffice. While the rear camera is capable of shooting videos at\u00a01080p, the front-facing camera captures images at 720p. The rear shooter by OminiVision makes use of\u00a0a 28mm wide angle lens with f/2.2 aperture.\u00a0Two SIM card slots offer 4G LTE connectivity which is a generous deal for a budget smartphone.</p><p>Moreover, features such as A-GPS and GLONASS complement the usual amenities such\u00a0as WiFi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0. Users can even charge the 2,200mAh Li-Po battery quicker using\u00a0QuickCharge 1.0 functionality that the microUSB 2.0 port offers.</p><p>In regards to software, Redmi 2 will run the latest MIUI 6 which comes with a number of fresh features\u00a0and a simpler design than the last iteration.</p><p>The smartphone will set you back by 699 CNY (approximately $110) if you\u00a0happen to get one from China starting from 9th January.

{"date": ["Feb 24, 2015"], "text": "<p><strong>By Umair Mohsin</strong></p><p>A few months ago we received an RFQ (Request From Quote) from a potential client in Dubai to redevelop their existing website. Understanding the competitiveness there, especially because of template buying and modifying firms, and <i>hoping</i> to make more money through selling additional services once they were on board, we quoted a figure of $4000 for the project which by our calculations was quite low for the scoping and time involved.</p><p>Imagine to our surprise when it was rejected by the procurement as being substantially high and they told us that they had locked a vendor for $250. A little dejected by the rejection and client\u2019s dependency on freelancers, we went back to the proverbial pavilion.</p><p>Five weeks later, the same procurement called and said that the vendor had not worked out and requested us to submit a price again. Anxious to not lose out, we dropped the price down to $3,300 which was almost a money losing proposition.</p><p>Again, a new vendor was locked and it wasn\u2019t us at $900. Downcast at the inability of the client to understand our value-proposition, we were rewarded at last when 3 weeks later the new vendor was again fired and our proposal was accepted this time with no change mostly due to extreme pressure from the top management. Suffice to say we delivered on our proposal and now have a happy retainer client.</p><p><strong>Once the domain of the \u2018Mad Men\u2019 who produced work that created the culture of the day, the agency landscape today has been obliterated economically, organizationally, and culturally</strong> by the increasing cost pressures on clients, global policies, global recession, the rise of internet and technologies which allows disintermediation on a scale never before witnessed and to some extent perhaps even corporate ignorance. The headiness and the glamour of the \u201cMad Men\u201d era is a relic of the past. Now \u2018Math Men\u2019 rule the roost in media and the power with them is growing.</p><p>Yet the blame for this lies nowhere else but with the agencies for the diminished value advertisers now place on the craft. \u00a0There was a time once when ad agencies used to be indispensable and termed \u2018brand partners\u2019 and \u2018brand custodians\u2019 when it came to advising clients how to build brands.</p><p>Coming up with an enduring campaign like \u201cChai Chaiyay\u201d, \u201cThe Legend Leads\u201d or \u201cDil Dil Pakistan\u2026Pepsi Pepsi Pakistan\u201d would power the agency\u2019s fortunes for decades. In those heady times, an agency would produce a maximum of two or three ad campaigns for TV, print and or an outdoor in a year with some format modifications and get paid handsome retainers that would allow agency owners to buy the lifestyles of their dreams.</p><p>In the late 90s, however the biggest agency networks started spinning out their media departments out of existing creative agencies into stand-alone companies<strong>,</strong> creating new entities such as Mindshare and StarCom. The goal was to hold onto a client\u2019s media spend even if they took their creative business elsewhere, whilst at the same time drive efficiencies with the clout of volume buys. However in essence what agencies really did was de-value the creative and strategy part of the business and with it the practices of hiring and paying for great agency talent.</p><p>For a while it worked and the groups grew until the clients began to realize that \u2018We are paying them too much for creating too little value\u2019. Clients than turned tables and forced agencies into accepting a fee based model instead, which of course was far less lucrative. As cost and marketing pressure grew, agencies were later were turned into \u2018vendors\u2019 to be controlled and policed by procurement departments, bought and sold like the ingredients that go into making products.</p><p>Perhaps an another example might suffice. A few days ago we were requested by an advertiser to pitch for their business against an incumbent agency which had gone into review. <strong>On inquiring how many agencies had been called to pitch, the answer we received was shocking \u2013 </strong><b>50 agencies.</b> We excused ourselves from the process.</p><p>Not only the pitching would have entailed undertaking a sizeable volume of work in developing the appropriate response but we would not have any indication of the final scope or value of the revenues especially when against 50 agencies there will be excessive pressure on price and to deliver more and to promise more. Combine this with the fact that clients are now looking for extensions on payment terms to as much as 120 days, it would have been disastrous. However even I we know that we do not have this luxury of declining this process for too long.</p><p>Squeezed by clients on one side due to their own myopia, agencies on the other have been beset by a horde of new tech invaders attacking every aspect of their value chain. Technology companies have commoditized the ad business model.</p><p>Starting an agency now is simply putting up a Facebook page and sourcing for work and producing an ad doesn\u2019t have to be an expensive undertaking anymore, especially given that commercial-grade HD video can now be shot on cameras that cost less than a single print ad in Dawn Newspaper.</p><p>Efficacy maybe debated but there\u2019s no running from the fact that pirated software and global access to cheap free-lance platforms that offer everything from $5 logos to $50 HD stock videos had turned the agency model on its head with tech firms now offering \u2018marketing solutions\u2019 from as low as Rs.4000.</p><p>In a world where the brand builders themselves never took time to create their own brands nor did we ever really define our value, we are now treated as little more than people with Photoshop skills, perhaps another reason why clients now expect marketing campaigns to be delivered \u2018Over-Night\u2019.</p><p>Digital advertising is also getting speedier and smarter bringing transparency, efficiency and precision to the industry but killing off the traditional processes and ways of making money. In days of old, ad executives would call various publishers, negotiate good rates and then whilst consulting the clients to their needs, placed the ads.</p><p>15% commission on advertising especially television spent powered the growth of the agencies and their people. Now advertisers themselves specify which sort of audiences they want to reach, where and how much they are willing to pay for as low as 3% or sometimes even 0% media commission.</p><p>It must be understood that this media commission was never the client\u2019s to begin with. It was negotiated by publishers to pay for the fact that agencies spent time and money on campaigns and saved the publishers massive resources which they would have had to undertake to produce the same campaigns.</p><p>With the rise of media buying agencies however, this was taken away from agencies and transferred to the client in the form of efficiencies. Creative &amp; Strategy were always a loss leader components for agencies which the media department would overcome. This was taken away and the demise started.</p><p>How bad is it? It\u2019s no secret that some of the biggest advertisers in Pakistan set KPIs for media buying at 20% of full rates, an impossible feat usually performed at the expense of increasing advertising time on TV Channels (now we have almost 22 minutes of advertising for each hour of content), invasive advertorials (e.g. front page of magazines, supplements, etc).</p><p>Global firms like P&amp;G are one-upping digital agencies and using their own Trading Desks on Ad Exchanges to buy space on websites that fit their requirements without requiring media planning firms. This is not just stopping at media buying either.</p><p>Advertisers globally are setting up their own in-house agencies since digital channels especially require hundreds of iterations of the same messages to fit the formats for social, PPC, blogs, etc almost on a daily basis and no agency can keep up with that cost efficiently. Whilst the big campaigns and ideas are still generated by the agency of record, more and more work is being done in-house by clients due to cost efficiencies and better data collection.</p><p>Many traditional and online publishers in Pakistan too are increasingly selling directly to clients and whilst some years off from being implemented in Pakistan, it is only a matter of time before digitization of media will ensure that radio, outdoor and television commercials will also be sold via \u2018Real Time Bidding\u2019 software.</p><p>Already print posters are slowly being replaced by electronic screens especially in our malls. These if networked can be updated instantly with ads and thus will be the first to be sold via real-time bidding exchanges. Though less than a percentage point of share at the moment, as these grow (and they will grow) will advertisers be needing agencies when software takes over in this country.</p><p>In 10 years, when an advertiser can display their latest commercial downloaded from their region\u2019s server in any mall, any billboard or medium they want at the click of a button within minutes and when they have digital measurement tools such as those currently being rolled out by behemoths such as Microsoft, IBM or Google with highly accurate predictions for the best targets for a campaign and which increasingly can quantify the success of the campaign, what need is there to retain \u2018glorified dispatchers\u2019 against these powerful algorithms, machines and tools.</p><p>The agency lives and dies by the people it retains and with this pressure it is very hard to attract the best talent without the pay of banks and tech firms or the glitter and perks of FMCGs. Infact here I\u2019m reminded of a joke \u2013 Advertising Agency: One Man Who Does The Work Of Twenty, With No Money, No Time Off And No Thanks.</p><p>Understandably, the client usually have a viewpoint that because they spend a lot of money, agencies must be rolling in dough because of the sheer volume of projects. Yet due to retainer and fees agreements at the out-set and then clients rarely sticking to their agreed scope of work and wanting everything immediately (thus requiring keeping larger teams than budgeted for) that is no longer true.</p><p>Let me elucidate. I will talk about my client with whom we have had a very long and very strong bond with the agency acting as their marketing department and brand consultants. For some years however this particular client had operated on a \u2018zero-cost increase\u2019 mantra with the familiar diminishing marketing budgets arguments and an ever growing \u2018to-do\u2019 list (which I am sure many fellow agency professionals will have experienced).</p><p>With increasing costs of infrastructure and people combined with no rates or remuneration increases, we were finding it increasingly difficult to continue to service the business at the level that the client had grown to. The growing large size of the client meant (aside from the fact that we did a pretty great job) that there was increasingly an operational loss for the agency. After a long time, we had to let them go.</p><p>There is a truism in the media industries that digital dimes don\u2019t replace analog dollars. It is a problem that music and movie producers and traditional publishers have faced and now it is our industry\u2019s demon as well. I will admit that we the agency people like to talk a lot about taking risks and pushing innovation, but I\u2019d be lying if I say our operational structures or our compensation systems are geared for it.</p><p>Agencies are not paid for innovative work or projects that fail but for the work that clients expect, one which might even elicit the familiar \u201cMaza Nahi Aayaa\u201d phrase. A failed campaign or venture could in fact be the moot point where a review could be called.</p><p>This of course is assuming that the Director Marketing or CMO remains stable. After all with each new change at the top, the agency usually changes and that\u2019s happening more frequently now (every 2 years). Thus not knowing whether the client is going to be around for another year or not, the agencies are increasingly just buttoning down and hoping to survive until the media wars subside.</p><p>Yet the same complexity that technology has wrought might be the agency\u2019s savior. With the rise of social media, SEO, mobile and tools that generate an enormous amount of data, it is the mandate of the modern agencies to\u00a0make sense of it all and regain our lofty position as the client\u2019s Brand Partner.</p><p>We need to help them make informed choices based on data across channels. As the go-to mediators for electronic to outdoor, combining data from channels and even out-doing the mighty titans of tech when it comes to better decisions e.g. Google cannot recommend Facebook if the conversions there are better. Agencies can.</p><p>As an industry now there is a need of the time to be more strategic, develop technical creative people, introduce process innovation\u00a0and learn to integrate and think like a marketing department promising marketing solutions rather than \u2018ad placements\u2019. This means it\u2019s also time to bring media departments back into the creative and tech side.</p><p>We ask our clients this question but have we ever asked ourselves whether we\u2019re actually providing value to our clients? Are we articulating what our value is clearly? If we can\u2019t, chances are clients don\u2019t see any value creation by us either and as we tell our clients \u201cany product that is a me-too or tries to make money without offering real value\u2026 is certain to fail\u201d.</p><p>There\u2019s never been a worse time to be in the ad agency business, or the best.</p><p><em>Writer is a Global Director \u2013 USA, UK, UAE, Australia &amp; South Asia For <a href=\"http://www.midigital.co/\" target=\"_blank\">MI DIGITAL, a global digital marketing and advertising agency</a>, that provides solutions at the interaction of technology and marketing for global brands.</em></p>", "title": [" Creative Revolution: Disrupting The Advertising Agency Model "], "author": ["Guest Author"]},
