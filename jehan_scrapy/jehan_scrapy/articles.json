[{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/7070/", "text": "The depression had already started setting in yesterday evening.\u00a0I got up very early this morning knowing that it was Ammi\u2019s death anniversary. The fact that she has been gone 12 years is hard to come to terms with.\n\nIt seems like only yesterday that she was lying on her bed and smiling as I walked into the house after work \u2013 warm, loving, welcoming and anxious to hear about my day. That is what I miss most about her. She was such a calm and loving person, such a great listener. One could talk to her about anything at all without feeling judged. I know my siblings all felt the same way. She was our closest friend \u2013 someone who was the repository of all our wildest dreams and our greatest fears.\n\nAs time passed I thought her loss would\u00a0become\u00a0easier to deal with. But it hasn\u2019t been easy at\u00a0 all. I try to focus on the happy memories, on her gentleness, her love and her great sense of humor. It brings her closer to me when I do that but the emptiness is something that is still hard to bear. Living in the same house and not having her nor Abbaji around is not easy at all. I am glad we valued them when they were alive, that we let them know how much we loved and cared about them.\n\nI went to the cemetery this morning to lay flowers on their grave, to say a prayer for them both and to tell them how much they were loved and missed by each and every one of us. Sending food to an orphanage in their memory is something that has become a standard thing I do every year. Ammi had a soft corner for orphans.\n\nI have been thinking about supporting\u00a0an initiative in the healthcare area because I know that both Ammi and Abbaji worried a lot about the pain that people who were ill went through and the lack of adequate access to healthcare for a large number of people who suffered from a variety of illnesses.\n\nAmmi, you were such a wonderful person, such a great mother and friend. We all loved you so much and we still do. We admired you for the great human being you were. May God keep you in His care. We know that He rewards those who were kind,\u00a0generous and compassionate \u2013 and you certainly were all those things!\n\nAs we go through life, we hope we can all be\u00a0a reflection of you. You taught us so much. We will forever be grateful.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Ammi we hope we can be a small reflection of\u00a0you"},

Memories of them listening to mushairas, qawwalis and ghazals together or doubling up with laughter while watching\u00a0Moeen Akhtar, fifty-fifty and other comedy shows on television. Or just watching the news and discussing political issues. That companionship lasted so many decades. It was no wonder then that when Ammi died in 2003, Abbaji no longer had the will to live. But he survived and lived and functioned for another 11 years \u2013 \u00a0never quite the same man. It always felt like he was waiting to rejoin her in her heavenly abode.\n\nThey tell me time heals all wounds. I am not too sure that\u2019s true. I\u00a0think over time we learn to accept that our dearly departed are no longer physically present but their spirit, their values, their memories live on in us and the happy memories\u00a0give us comfort as we continue with our lives without them.\n\nToday as I pay homage to my father, I remember what a great man he was, a wonderful human being who was always there for so many people \u2013 family, friends, colleagues, even strangers. It seemed to me that it gave him joy and satisfaction to be able to help people. He never rested. He was always on the go. He worked long hours but always found time to visit friends and relatives especially when they were ailing or in need.\u00a0We often wondered how he did it, where he found the energy. He just loved people and networking was an intrinsic part of who he was \u2013 connecting people, getting things done \u2013 the word \u2018impossible\u2019 did not exist in his dictionary.\n\nFostering community spirit was another thing my father did well. He headed many organizations during his life time \u2013 he was Chairman of the\u00a0UAE Bankers Association, Chairman of the International Islamic Society in Hong Kong, President of the Pakistan Association in Hong Kong, he was on the committee for the rebuilding of the Kowloon Mosque in Hong Kong\u00a0just to mention a few.\n\nAssociations tend to be very political and there are always egos at play but my father somehow managed to keep everyone\u00a0happy and get them to work together for causes that benefited the community. He was also a natural at fundraising. He convinced numerous people to donate to causes that he felt strongly about \u2013 and he collected millions of dollars for the Kowloon Mosque reconstruction, for the survivors of the Iran Earthquake, for the Society for Special Children in Pakistan, and for many education and health related social causes. People so easily trusted him. Some gave him large amounts of money on a regular basis to contribute to whatever charities he thought were doing a good job. He kept a detailed account of every cent contributed by anyone and made sure they knew what their money was being given in aid of.\n\nDuring his banking career, Abbaji met and interacted with a lot of high profile people all of whom were greatly impressed by him \u2013 one such person was the former British Prime Minister James Callaghan who signed this picture \u201cBrothers-in-arms\u201d. He treasured all these pictures and if you ever made the mistake of asking him where such-and-such a picture was taken, you would be entertained with stories of amazing encounters.\n\nLarge dinner parties and house guests in every room, were a normal occurrence in our household. I remember very few times when we didn\u2019t have someone staying with us. The house was always full of people. Abbaji loved to entertain. It made him happy.\u00a0I am sure he is\u00a0throwing one grand dinner party after another in his\u00a0heavenly abode. Rest in Peace Abbaji. We love you and miss you very much. Give our love to Ammi. Both of you continue to live in our hearts and in our memories.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Has it already been a\u00a0year?"},

If there was an injustice and Najma spotted it, she would take it on as a personal mission to take a stand against\u00a0it \u2013 not by yelling off the rooftops but by researching the root causes and campaigning for reform through the power of the pen (or the keyboard).\n\nNajma was a soft-spoken person with a great sense of humor and the ability to make a person feel totally comfortable in her presence. I hadn\u2019t seen her lately due to my schedule (and I will always regret that) but I remember the many conversations and interactions we have had over the years. She was such an easy person to have a discourse with even though she had very strong views and a deep knowledge about a diverse set of issues but never once did I feel overwhelmed in her presence. When we look\u00a0for heroes in our midst, and women leaders who have made impact, Najma Sadeque should certainly be counted amongst them. She led through her writings, impacted policies, changed minds and highlighted injustices.\n\nSome of the books,\u00a0reports and chapters that Najma Sadeque wrote include:\n\nFinancial Terrorism\n\n The Great Agricultural Hoax\n\n How they run Pakistan\n\n How they run the World\n\n Death by Entrapment\n\n Haunting Shadows of Human Security\n\n Why Land is a Woman\u2019s Issue\n\n Seed Heritage for Sale\n\nSome of her pieces can be read on her blog:\u00a0https://najmasadeque.wordpress.com. We are assured that her daughter, documentary film maker and activist Deneb Sumbul will continue to update Najma\u2019s blog with her articles and thoughts so that the wealth of knowledge and research are\u00a0not lost.\n\nNajma Sadeque\u00a0was one of the\u00a0founders of Shirkatgah and was amongst the founding team\u00a0of the Women\u2019s Action Forum. People she worked with in the Dawn Group and The News, as well as in WAF and Shirkatgah speak very highly of the teacher, the mentor, the team player, the activist and writer that Najma was. Her commitment to her work and to the issues she stood for was very apparent to anyone she came in contact with, and she worked tirelessly to try and\u00a0address the injustices that exist in society.\n\nNajma Sadeque passed away\u00a0yesterday morning as a result of\u00a0kidney failure. May she Rest in Peace.\n\nIn a message announcing her death, her daughter Deneb Sumbul stated:\u00a0 \u201cIn how many ways can I describe my wonderful indomitable mother \u2013 she wore so many hats \u2013 an activist to the last, journalist for over 35 years, one of the founding members of WAF and someone who had so many interests and never short on wonderful ideas and new perspectives.\u201d\n\nMy condolences go out to Deneb and her brother and the rest of Najma\u2019s family. She was an amazing person who was an invaluable member of\u00a0our society. Her passion, her sincerity, her friendship and her work and values will not be forgotten. She will continue to live through her children.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "A tribute to Najma Sadeque who died yesterday at age\u00a072"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2015/01/06/happy-birthday-ammi-you-made-us-who-we-are/", "text": "Each January they celebrated their birthdays at midnight together. Abbaji\u2019s birthday fell on January 5 and Ammi\u2019s on January 6. We loved the fact that the celebrations continued for two days. They asked us not to make\u00a0a fuss but we always did. Our parents were very\u00a0special and whatever little we could do to show them how much we loved them, was nowhere\u00a0near enough. They deserved much much more.\n\nAmmi was a pillar of strength for Abbaji and for all of us. It was difficult to understand\u00a0how a soft, gentle and loving woman could be the glue that held us together.\u00a0She was there\u00a0in our most challenging moments, she\u00a0offered kindness, tender loving care, compassion, words of understanding and support to\u00a0anyone she came in contact with.\u00a0She\u00a0never had an ill word to say about anyone and, despite being seriously ill for decades, she never lost her sense of humor or that soft, charming, sweet smile.\n\nThrough all the years that I was growing up I remember Ammi busy seeing to everyone\u2019s needs, never complaining, never asking for anything in return. Whenever any of us asked her if she wanted\u00a0anything she would just smile and say \u201cI have everything I need\u201d. In the early days when we were kids and Abbaji was a struggling young banker, she had very little. My father was a very generous man and even though his income was small, in addition to the needs of his family, he always tried to fulfill the needs of his parents, siblings and friends. Ammi supported him completely in everything he did.\n\nI know everyone thinks their mothers are very special but my mother was truly one of a kind. I don\u2019t think I have ever met anyone so selfless, so caring, so giving, \u00a0so full of love and compassion. Although she never made any demands on any of us, we\u00a0would pick up gifts for her wherever in the world we happened to be \u2013 things we thought she would enjoy. She appreciated everything we bought and derived so much pleasure from the gifts.\n\nI remember a time my brother sent her a new walkman (yes this was pre-iPod and mp3 player days). She was so excited because she loved listening to music. A family member\u00a0came to the house later that day, saw the walkman and asked her if he could have it and she gave it to him without any hesitation. We were really annoyed with him but she said his heart was set on it \u2026 and it\u00a0was okay.\n\nA lot of people took advantage of her good nature and she let them. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t know they were taking advantage of her. She just liked making people happy, seeing a smile on their\u00a0faces. Her first instinct always was to say yes to whatever was asked of her.\n\nHaving been married at a very early age, she was self-educated. She read a lot, watched films and documentaries and engaged in social and political discussions. Anyone\u00a0who met her thought that she must at least have a Masters\u2019 Degree. We used to laugh about it and Abbaji used to say that she should get a PhD. :)\n\nThroughout our school years and our work life, I remember running into the house, seeking her out and telling her everything that had happened during the day. She would listen patiently and smile and ask questions and laugh. It seemed that she lived her life through us. To a lot of feminists\u00a0that may seem wrong but it was what she wanted. Does anyone have a right to decide how someone else chooses to live? She lived for her family \u2026 and that is the way she wanted it.\n\nAmmi was ill for decades. It was painful for us to see her in hospital so often. But she was such a good patient \u2013 such an easy person to look after. When we think of her even now what we remember most is her smile, her laughter, her love. She really was the best mother in the world. God bless her. We miss you Ammi but we know that wherever you are, there is a smile on your face. :)", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Happy birthday Ammi \u2013 you made us who we\u00a0are!"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2015/01/05/he-was-an-amazing-man-happy-birthday-abbaji/", "text": "He would have been 90 today if he had not passed away last year. A\u00a0lot of people have said\u00a0that we were lucky to have had him in our lives for so many years \u2013 and I know that\u00a0we were indeed fortunate. But no matter how old\u00a0a father\u00a0is when he passes away, it is too soon. It\u00a0\u00a0leaves a vacuum that is impossible to fill. No day passes by that we don\u2019t think of him, of the person that he was, and all the things\u00a0he did for us and others.\n\nI was speaking with\u00a0someone the other day about Abbaji \u2013 and he said \u201cMushtaque Sahab did so much for so many people. He was responsible for getting employment for a lot of people, for giving them the opportunity they needed to build their lives and progress in their careers\u201d. And it is true. When I think about the number of lives he impacted, it truly amazes me. And he never expected anything in return except perhaps a smile or a visit now and then to update him on their progress. He was also a mentor to many.\n\nMy father was very\u00a0well respected by all who knew him and worked with him. He started his career with the Bank of China in Karachi in 1948 but was then \u201cgifted\u201d to the National Bank of Pakistan five years later when the Bank of China closed its operations in Karachi. He was a banker for 43 years in Karachi, in Hong Kong and in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. He was a man of integrity and was a person whose handshake was enough of a commitment.\n\nThe officials at the Bank of China were well known to him. In later years we discovered that the President of the Bank of China was an old colleague and friend of Abbaji\u2019s. I remember that in the many years that we spent in Hong Kong, they visited us often and considered Abbaji to be a close associate.\n\nIn 1995 the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China appointed Abbaji\u00a0as the only foreign advisor to China on the transfer of Hong Kong to PRC in 1997. That was indeed a great honor for him and for Pakistan. He was very disappointed that the Government of Pakistan never accorded him any recognition for this great honor that he brought to his country. But then do they ever really recognize people who deserve to\u00a0be recognized?\n\nAbbaji was the greatest PR man I have ever known. It didn\u2019t matter what anyone needed done \u2013 friend or foe or a complete stranger. They just had to mention it and Abbaji would go to every extreme to make sure that their work was done. Our house was always full of guests. He used to say to Ammi \u201d I don\u2019t have any vices \u2013 I don\u2019t smoke, I don\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t gamble \u2013 the only vice I have is entertaining people.\u201d And entertain he did. I remember cooking for 100 people at a time sometimes when he decided to throw a big party at the house. We always had a variety of dishes on the table from different types of salads, meats, fish, curries, barbecues and numerous desserts because Abbaji had a sweet tooth. He would say \u201cThere is a separate place\u00a0in your tummy for desserts.\u201d\n\nOnce he went to Hong Kong airport to drop off one of his\u00a0guests. There he saw an Indian couple who seemed to be fretting so he went up to them and asked if everything was alright. They told him that someone from the Indian High Commission was supposed to pick them up but there was no sign of him. Abbaji said \u201cNo problem. Come home with me and I will have you dropped off at their home after a while\u201d. It was 6 a.m. on a Sunday when he brought them home. He asked me to make puris, tarkari, suji ka halwa, chanas etc which I did. After they had a nice breakfast, he phoned their hosts and arranged to have them sent over to their home. As the Indian couple left, the wife said to Abbaji \u201cAap to bhagwan bun kar aagaey humaray liyay\u201d (You descended\u00a0as a god (I guess she may have meant angel) to rescue us). That was Abbaji \u2013 ever ready to assist, to be the saviour for any person in distress. He raised funds for many causes \u2013 people parted with their money easily whenever he asked because they trusted him and knew that he would make sure it went to the right organizations and causes.\n\nIs it any wonder then that people remember my father with great affection and miss him immensely. As for us, his children, all we can do is thank God for having given us a father whom we can be proud of, who worked hard to give his family whatever he could afford, whose honesty and integrity everyone\u00a0would vouch for. He instilled in\u00a0us values that\u00a0have become an intrinsic part of our makeup. All we can do is live the life he wanted us to and hope that he is looking down on us with pride.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "He was an amazing father and a great man \u2013 Happy birthday\u00a0Abbaji!"},

But today I felt the need to write more than just a tweet or a status message and so here we are \u2026\n\nThe last few weeks have been hectic. The P@SHA ICT Awards 2014 and then the preparations for APICTA 2014 in Jakarta have kept many of us on our toes.\n\nSome may say that I should have waited until I had news of how Team Pakistan fared at this year\u2019s Asia Pacific ICT Awards APICTA). I think not. The wins are just part of the journey \u2013 and that news can wait until after the Gala Dinner tonight. I need to pen this down now before it is coloured by the results.\n\nEvery year for the past 11 years we have been bringing teams to APICTA \u2013 to\u00a0capitals across the Asia Pacific \u2026 and each year we have been able to hold our heads high at the effort and the performance of tech innovators from Pakistan. Judges from across the region have started to sit up and take notice. They have remarked (with some surprise) on the quality of teams and ideas. They have asked jokingly what we were \u2018feeding them\u2019 these days, of how \u00a0products keep emerging\u00a0through the cracks from a country that has not been traditionally known as a tech innovation hub.\n\nEach year we continue to impress them with the people we bring to these Awards. Not all the teams win \u2013 they can\u2019t because they are competing against the best-of-the-best from the entire region. We at APICTA acknowledge all of them as winners because that is what they all are \u2013 winners! Whether they bag an award\u00a0or not, they are bursting with confidence, with knowledge, with innovation and passion for what they do. They mingle and network and show the world the true face of Pakistan \u2026\n\nSomething Hunaid Hameed (our Secondary School Student entry)\u00a0said during one of the first mentoring sessions in Jakarta this year, has remained in my consciousness for the past few days. He said \u201cJawwad Farid has been guiding and mentoring me since I won the P@SHA LaunchPad event two years ago, helping me to improve and develop my product. Another few months of this and I may start worshiping him.\u201d Those words touched my heart. It is kids like these who make us continue to do what we do \u2013 put in 24 hour days, put our heart and soul into working with the teams, sharing their hopes and dreams, their joys and their heartbreak. We are all one \u2013 Team Pakistan!\n\nThis year was no different. 21 products from Pakistan were presented at APICTA 2014 in Jakarta. The teams started working tirelessly on improving the presentations they had made at\u00a0the P@SHA ICT Awards, working with mentors remotely and in the cities they were based \u2013 Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad.\n\nChief Mentor Jawwad Ahmed Farid did not travel with us to Jakarta but he worked constantly with many\u00a0of the teams to assist them in\u00a0presenting their products in the best possible light. In Jakarta Team Pakistan took over the Executive Floor, lounge and meeting room\u00a0on 3 consecutive nights where Zafar Khan, Dr. Shoab A. Khan, Badar Khushnood and Sultan Hamdani listened to pitches,\u00a0mentored, scolded, cajoled and did whatever was necessary to get our bright innovators to put up their best performance.\n\nIt is always good to see them all coming together and working towards a common objective \u2013 to leave an impression on the minds of hundreds of technology professionals and judges\u00a0from the region that Pakistan is at par with them in producing cutting edge technology solutions for business and consumers across the globe . It is no doubt exhausting but it is well worth it because in the end, win or not, we are able to hold our heads high and say we gave our best for our country and our industry.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The deed is done \u2013 now all we do is\u00a0wait"},

What she said next was even more exciting. She asked if P@SHA would like to invite a startup from our community\u00a0to participate. As you can imagine, there was only one answer I could give to that question \u2013 a resounding YES!\n\nBlackbox Connect is a 2-week immersion program for founders who are based outside the US. Founders will come to Silicon Valley and live at the Blackbox Mansion\u00a0where they have the opportunity to live and collaborate with like-minded entrepreneurs from all around the world and partake in an intense agenda of meetings and workshops with entrepreneurs, investors, experts and executives.\n\nGoogle for Entrepreneurs \u00a0covers the cost of the\u00a0Blackbox\u00a0Connect\u00a0program (including airfare, tuition, room & board)\u00a0\u00a0for one founding team from each country.\n\nCriteria for eligible startups are as follows: \u2014 Must be based outside the US \u2014 Only founders (not employees) may attend; up to 2 of the founders can attend \u2014 Founder attending must be proficient in English \u2014 Start up must have launched a technology based MVP (minimum viable product) and gathered feedback from early adopter customers. If product is B2B, then feedback from prospective customers is acceptable. This was how P@SHA became the official partner for the Blackbox Connect Google for Entrepreneurs funded program in Pakistan. The first participants selected to go from Pakistan were Groopic and Tunacode (yes I know I said that only one team from each country would be sponsored but the Blackbox team was so impressed with the quality of applications that we sent that they selected two). The second time around the same thing happened \u2013 Appography and SMSAll were selected by Fadi Bishara \u2013 the founder of Blackbox Connect. -Ideally, but NOT required: startup should have raised some investment capital, have a team between 2-20, and have a product or service that can be launched globally. Last week P@SHA put out a call for applications for the next program which will be in the fall. Have you applied? Many of your peers have.

She taught us what it meant to be gentle, compassionate, loving and generous human beings. Even her silence was comfortine; her smile made all our pain and worries disappear. Her life centered around us \u2013 her family. She was the best mother in the world and all of us adored her.\n\nOn April 1 eleven years ago Ammi\u00a0breathed her last and left a gap in our lives that no-one can ever fill. Her physical presence, her voice, her lovely smile, her subtle sense of humour are all things that each of us misses acutely. In spirit though she never really left us. It is like she continues to watch over us every second of every day \u2013 celebrating each achievement, smiling with us through our happy moments and being comfortingly close through every difficult\u00a0period of our lives.\n\nEven now after eleven years, whenever\u00a0I go home from a day at work or return from a trip, intuitively I look towards what used to be her room expecting her to be sitting there on the lookout for me, ready to welcome me home and listen to my so-called \u2018adventures\u2019, hear about the people I had met and the things I had done during the day. She was such a good listener and always knew exactly what to say. She was our confidante, our friend, our mentor and\u00a0sometimes even\u00a0our partner-in-crime especially when we were trying to get out of doing something that Abbaji wanted us to do. She covered\u00a0up for us whenever it looked as if we might get into trouble for some minor mischief that we had gotten into and she was always there to protect and defend us whenever we needed her to.\n\nAmmi was ill for many many years. She suffered from high blood pressure, systemic lupus, pulmonary embolisms and various complications. She spent a lot of days and nights in hospitals in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Karachi \u2026 but never through her worst suffering did she lose her ability to smile and comfort the rest of us. We marvelled at her patience, her ability to bear suffering without ever uttering a word of complaint. At times when she should just have been thinking about herself, she continued to worry about what Abbaji and the rest of us were going through. She didn\u2019t want to put us through any discomfort or be the cause for\u00a0worry. Whenever anyone asked how she was, she always smiled broadly and responded \u201cI am fine.\u201d She was the most amazing person in the world. We were so lucky to have her in our lives for as long as we did.\n\nToday as we mark her 11th death anniversary, all any of us can do is to honour her memory by\u00a0continuing to be the kind of human beings she wanted us to be \u2013 to care about each other, to love life and live it to the fullest, to work with integrity and dedication and to be humane, kind and compassionate to all those around us. Ammi, we miss you so very much. You were the best mother in the world and we will always love you. May God keep you in his care and bestow upon you all the wonderful bounties of heaven which you so richly deserve.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Ammi we love you and miss\u00a0you"},

But as I got out of the car, I noticed this sign. A couple of \u2018d\u2019s\u2019 missing no doubt but the message was clear so I got back into the car and looked around for alternative parking.\n\nThe guard who was stationed in the carpark stopped me and said it was okay for me to park there and asked why I was looking for a new spot. I explained to him that those two parking spots were for people with disabilities. He looked at me as if I was some strange phenomenon; shrugged and said \u201cThat\u2019s okay. No-one pays attention to the sign\u201d. I didn\u2019t really want to argue with him but I did say to him that signs such as this were placed there for a reason and that we should abide by them.\n\nAs I parked my car in another location and headed for the entrance of Metro, I noticed that two other families had parked their cars in those spaces reserved for people with disabilities.\n\nWhy am I ranting about this? Because it is not an isolated incident. I have noticed many times that at airports where there are numerous announcements stating that smoking is not allowed, people stand below No Smoking signs and smoke. At times I have gone up to such people and indicated to them that they were smoking in a No Smoking area. They shrug, grin and look the other way. Similarly, counters\u00a0at immigration\u00a0which are meant for unaccompanied women and children more often than not are populated by long queues of men. I am one of the troublemakers who goes up to such people and asks \u201cWhich one are you \u2013 an unaccompanied woman or a child?\u201d . I also take it up with immigration staff \u00a0\u2013 why are the signs put up if they are not going to be adhered to, I ask. They are temporarily embarrassed and some of them move away but only until troublemakers like me are no longer in the vicinity.\n\nStrangely these same people will follow rules and signs put up at airports in other countries so why not here? Is it because they know they can get away with it? Whatever the reason, I find it extremely irritating \u2026", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Why do we not pay attention to\u00a0signs?"},

Abbaji\u2019s birthday falls on January 5; Ammi was born on January 6 \u2026 they always cut a cake together at midnight. There were smiles all round; exchange of gifts and cards; all of us singing \u2018Happy birthday\u2019 slightly off-tune. Those were magical and happy times for our family. I remember how as they grew old together, they still continued the tradition of exchanging birthday cards and gifts \u2013 Abbaji still bought for Ammi pieces of jewelery and some of the loveliest silk and chiffon sarees I have ever seen \u2013 things he hadn\u2019t been able to give her in the early years of their marriage while he was building his career. It was so sweet to see.\n\nYesterday was Abbaji\u2019s birthday. He has been feeling rather poorly of late. He suffers from Pulmonary Fibrosis and has withdrawn into himself little by little since Ammi passed away over 10 years ago. A companionship spanning decades had come to an end and I think he has just not been able to accept that Ammi is no longer physically amongst us although her spirit and her love continue to live in each one of us. We cut a cake yesterday as we always do and I sang Happy birthday a little off-tune as I always do; there were gifts as there always are, phone calls from all my siblings to convey special wishes \u2026 but none of it was quite the same. It hasn\u2019t been quite the same since Ammi went away. We miss her every moment. She was the most precious person in our lives.\n\nThis morning I missed Ammi\u2019s special smile, her unaffected and genuine laughter, her amazing sense of humour, her gentleness, her warmth, her kindness, her love. I wanted so much to wish her Happy Birthday, to give her flowers, to see the delight on her face when I gave her the suits that I had had made for her, to spoil her as much as I could, to make her feel like the most important person in all the world which she was. But I couldn\u2019t. I went instead \u00a0to visit her grave, to lay on it a bed of fresh rose petals, to pray that she was blessed with everything her heart desired.\n\nHappy birthday my dearest Ammi.

And, to be honest, I miss writing them.\n\nI used to find so much pleasure in writing about all sorts of things \u2013 from posts about innovation in Pakistan, about entrepreneurship, about all sorts of P@SHA activities, about things I had seen and done, about different types of food, about people I met who amazed me \u2026 you name it \u2026 I wrote about it.\n\nSo here I am again on the first day of 2014 putting together my first brief post hoping that it will be the stepping stone to many pieces this year.

I can still remember so many years later my total sense of disbelief that she was gone. How had it happened so suddenly \u2013 one minute she was smiling at me and the next moment she had breathed her last? Why is it that it had never occurred to us that this day would come? It was as if our very foundation had been shaken. Abbaji and my siblings and I were all in a state of shock. Our sweet darling Ammi had been taken from us. It was just so unthinkable, so totally unbelievable.\n\nTime passed and as I threw myself into my work, I began to realize that no matter how much I missed her, she had not really left us. She was a part of us and somehow in everything I did she was still with me encouraging me, cheering me on, celebrating with me and\u00a0watching over me. Her smile, her calm demeanor, her courage, her ability to forgive and look for the best in people, her complete honesty and the unconditional love that she showered on us every day of our lives, has stayed with us giving us the strength to go on and to live our lives to the fullest.\n\nAs we mark the 10th anniversary of my mother\u2019s death, I remember all the happy times that we spent with her \u2013 laughing with her, sharing even the most trivial of stories. She was our repository of confidences. Ammi knew everything because we told her everything. The minute any of us stepped into the house we would go to her and relate all that had happened that day \u2013 the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly. She would listen with such patience and such attention. She shared in the excitement and in the joy and unruffled our feathers when we faced any adversity. Everything we said was of interest to her. We mattered to her \u2013 and she made sure we knew that. Is it any wonder then that we grew up knowing that we were loved and cherished? Every memory of Ammi is special to each of us. She dedicated her entire life to us \u2013 her family. And we loved her more than we will ever love anyone else.\n\nMany times in life we forget to tell those who are special to us how much we care about them. And much later we live in regret because we didn\u2019t appreciate them when we had a chance. Not so with Ammi. All of us told her every day how much we loved her and how much she meant to us. She knew that she was the center of our existence. She knew that we thought she was the best mother in the world. She knew that our lives revolved around her. She knew that we appreciated everything she did for us throughout our lives. She was an angel from heaven and to heaven she returned. But even now she seems to be watching over us from the heavens \u2013 making sure we are happy and looked after.\n\nThank you Ammi for continuing to be our guide. We love you and miss you and hope that you will always be proud of who we are. You taught us to be warm and affectionate, to be humane and compassionate, to be hardworking, honest and just and to make the most out of life.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/indian-visa-how-is-one-expected-to-know/", "text": "Whether you are a Pakistani applying for an Indian visa or an Indian applying for a Pakistani visa, the road ahead is a challenging one for you. I have been fortunate in that I have a strong sponsor in the form of Nasscom who are P@SHA\u2019s counterparts in India. However, even then there are stumbling blocks especially if you are applying for a Triple Entry or Multiple Entry visa. Let me tell you about some of them.\n\nSo if you are applying for a triple entry visa, you are asked what your port of entry will be \u2013 Delhi/Mumbai/Wagah. How is one supposed to know if during a 12 month period one will have to go to a meeting to Mumbai/Bangalore/Pune which would mean entering via Mumbai OR if one will be going to a meeting in Delhi/Gurgaon/Chennai which would entail going through Delhi. You are also expected to know which hotel you will be staying at. Really ridiculous. So what does one do? Either get a crystal ball or guess and keep your fingers crossed that those will be the cities you will be going to and that the relevant hotels that you have mentioned will have rooms available should you need to stay there.\n\nAnd before we have a barrage of anti-India statements, our government does the same. It is called reciprocity.\n\nStranger still is what happened this year to one of our delegates who had booked Hotel A in Mumbai to stay at but when she discovered that it was miles away from where the conference was, and that everyone else was staying at Hotel B, she tried to cancel the room in Hotel A and book a room in Hotel B. She was told by Hotel A that she would be charged for one night (which is normal) so she decided to stay in Hotel A for one night and then move to Hotel B for the days that remained. At the airport, in the column on the\u00a0Residence Permit where she was asked to fill in the name and address of the hotel she would be staying at, she put in the name and address of Hotel B because that was where she would be spending the larger portion of her stay.\n\nBig mistake! When she got to Hotel A, she was told that they could not put her up for the one night because the Residence Permit had the name of Hotel B on it. They would be breaking the law if they allowed her to stay. The hotel management was very nice; they called the other hotel and arranged for her to move to Hotel B the same night but it was a hassle and it was tiring and time-consuming for the poor lady. She looked absolutely harassed by the time she checked into Hotel B where we ran into her and she related this entire story.\n\nMy question to both governments \u2013 Do we really have to do this to each other? Who designs these forms? Don\u2019t they think the whole thing through? Can\u2019t they make things easier. Even the US that is so security conscious, gives a country visa to us. Why should India and Pakistan not do the same for each other? Let us do away with the city specific visas and the defining of ports of entry. Harassing business people and family visitors doesn\u2019t keep out the terrorists. They have their ways and get in somehow.\n\nAnother update is that the Indian CID has taken a liking to me. I have been travelling to India for the past 12 years on business but it is only in the last two years that I have been visited by the CID. They are polite enough and I guess they are just doing their job but surely their time could be better utilized elsewhere rather than checking up on me and asking me why I am there, how long was I going to stay, the exact details of my flight back, what i was going to do while I was in India etc. etc. Come on guys \u2013 have I suddenly started to look more suspicious than I did before? Surely not! \u00a0I also object to the fact that although I had told you that 8 more colleagues of mine were arriving the next day, you didn\u2019t come to check up on them. Why do I get all the love? ;)", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "An important question for Indian and Pakistani visa\u00a0officials"},

His intention was to get Zacky to test it out for free (Zafar, please note: your son was deprived of a beta testing fee).\n\nThe little one took hold of the iPad and start playing very intuitively with the application and was totally engrossed in it the entire evening. He showed it to his mom and his dad and there was no question about how much he loved the app. All of us knew that it would be a hit. I convinced Imran to load it onto my iPad mini the next day and have been playing it myself whenever I get a chance.\n\nGoing through Facebook statuses of friends one day, I noticed the following message put up by Sadia Khan who is COO of Autosoft Dynamics:\n\nRaem and Anya\u2019s latest favorite song and app on the ipad \u2013 Urdu based nursery rhyme, Duddoo aur Dhobi! Check it out friends and family. Its been made by a Pakistani company and I give it top marks on engaging kids. Both of my kids for the first time in a long while want to play with the same app. I have even caught myself unwittingly humming the duddoo and dhobi song \u2013 do check it out and let me know what you all think!! P.s. its free for now so I\u2019d download before they start charging!!!\n\nSo it is not only kids but also their parents who are really taken with this app.\n\nJugnoo Media\u2019s mission is to create wholesome entertainment and educational content for kids of all ages (I guess that means I am included too). This is good news for South Asian parents who think there is a dearth of good localized content available in electronic format.\n\nJugnoo means \u2018Firefly\u2019 in Urdu, Hindi and other regional languages of South Asia. The venture is named Jugnoo Media because the founders were simply enthralled by the vast presence of this small insect while growing up. They say that in the old days, it was the norm for young children to run after these beautiful insects and attempt to catch them. Some would put them in glass bottles to make lanterns. In today\u2019s day and age, this beautiful and fragile insect is under severe threat. As cities become large, paved and cemented with less and less natural habitat, the jugnoo has virtually disappeared from large cities of South Asia.\n\nLocal culture, heritage and languages are on the defensive; being squeezed out by the massive global culture which emphasizes cultural homogenity at the expense of cultural diversity. It tends to be more material than spiritual and is devoid of local context. Jugnoo Media wants to change that. Its first project is to build immersive digital toys in local languages that are based on popular nursery rhymes of the region. Good luck guys! We look forward to seeing more apps/games/stories coming out of the Jugnoo Media stable (or should that be \u2018garage\u2019)?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Jugnoo Media launches Duddoo Aur Dhobi \u2013 an app for South Asian\u00a0toddlers"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/cathay-pacific-you-have-lost-a-customer/", "text": "I have always been a Cathay Pacific fan \u2013 well maybe not always. There was a time when the Cathay stewardesses didn\u2019t treat women business travellers with the same respect and decorum as they did the male traveller and that used to annoy the hell out of me. But either the number of women business travellers have increased over time thus forcing a change in the attitude of stewardesses or the CX training has focused on bringing about this positive change. Anyway, suffice it to say that I was until recently a very satisfied Cathay Pacific customer.\n\nSo what happened to change all that? Well, this time when I was traveling to San Francisco I decided to fly Cathay Pacific. Since I had some frequent flyer miles available I upgraded myself on the outgoing sector to business class. I enjoyed the comfort so much that on the return journey I went online to the Cathay Pacific site to upgrade the return journey although I had to pay a little for the upgrade. Sound simple? I thought so. Apparently it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe upgrade wasn\u2019t reflected in my online booking so I asked my brother who lives in Hong Kong to talk to CX and find out why the change was not reflected. In response to this they checked and told him that it was done.\n\nA happy ending you would think. No it wasn\u2019t \u2013 it was the beginning of a nightmare. Apparently what CX had done was that instead of upgrading me on the sector they had issued a new business class ticket and charged me for it. How or why was this done, you might ask. Well, when I checked with CX on landing in Hong Kong, I was informed that I should never have used the online mechanism for the upgrade. Isn\u2019t that what it is there for, I asked? I was told quite rudely that passengers were not expected to use the service \u2013 that it only resulted in messing up things. And because my brother had made the call as a follow up, they said the instructions had been duplicated resulting in two tickets (Economy & Business) being valid on the same day, on the same flight, same passenger name, same Passport number, same Marco Polo Club number instead of a simple upgrade from Economy to Business.\n\nWhereas I can understand that mistakes happen, the rudeness and total inflexibility with which the Cathay Pacific team dealt with the problem at Chep Lap Kwok airport \u2013 the counter staff as well as the Supervisor \u2013 put me off traveling CX. I thought that the customer was always right. In this case the deaf ears of the airline staff proved that customer service is not of any importance to what used to be one of the best airlines in the world. It\u2019s really sad. To win a customer takes a lot of effort but to lose them it takes but a moment of rudeness. Has Cathay Pacific forgotten that as a customer, I have a choice of many airlines and that my satisfaction or otherwise with their service can influence my decision and the decision of many people in my network?\n\nSince they were aware that I could use only one ticket on that flight from SFO to Hong Kong to Karachi, wouldn\u2019t it have been easier to accept the mistake of their online system & staff, and refund the economy portion? They would have lost nothing by doing that and would have in fact gained the gratitude and loyalty of an existing customer.\n\nThis happened to me last June and only now have I been able to write about it. That shows how upset I was and have been since then. I didn\u2019t even want to think about it. CX turned what had been a wonderful business trip to San Francisco and personal stopover in Hong Kong into a frustrating and annoying experience. I didn\u2019t expect this of you Cathay Pacific.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Cathay Pacific \u2013 you have lost a\u00a0customer"},

To say that I was unhappy at not being able to go with them, would be an understatement. One of the greatest joys in my job at P@SHA is to recognize talent and innovation and promote and project it \u2013 talk about it, shout from the rooftops so that the world will realize the brilliance of the young people of this country. So not being able to go and witness their brilliance in Brunei was disappointing to say the least.\n\nAnd brilliant they were!! Yet again!! Only 7 products were nominated from Pakistan this year. Of these 4 came away with Silver Awards. Of those 4, we had the amazing Dr. Shoab Khan, CEO of CARE, with their product\u00a0Secure High Data Rate Wideband Networking Radio Waveform with Multiple Access for Software Defined Radios\u00a0in the Communications Category, Munir Usman and Amir Ali Jiwani, CEO and CTO of Pi-Labs for their products Candy Pot/Feed Garfield\u00a0in the very competitive New Media & Entertainment Category, Tunacode with their product gKrypt\u00a0and a joint nomination from EME (NUST)/CARE/Shifa \u2013 the\u00a0Network Enabled Retinal Image Analysis and Screening System for Grading and Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy.\n\nAs Jawwad Ahmed Farid, our Chief Mentor for APICTA, says \u201cwe breathed a sigh of relief when we saw Dr. Shoab Khan walk into the Empire Hotel in Brunei because he is our Wasim Akram and Javed Miandad rolled into one. We know he is going to bowl everyone out and/or go for a huge SIX\u201d. And that\u2019s certainly true. CARE continues to innovate and produce great applications that compare with the best in the world.\n\nWhat is extremely heartwarming is the performance of two startups in the most difficult categories at APICTA \u2013 Security and New Media and Entertainment. Pi-Lab\u2019s Candy Pot/Feed Garfield Game Engine and Tunacode\u2019s gKrypt made the judges sit up and take notice. Such work out of Pakistan always surprises technology gurus from the rest of the world but I think as year after year our technologists show what they are capable of, the judges are becoming used to seeing such innovation from our ICT industry.\n\nThe preparations for Team Pakistan\u2019s participation at APICTA began weeks before the team travelled to Brunei. Jawwad Farid sent templates, tutorials and guidelines so that the teams would start preparing themselves for the task ahead. He and I bullied participants so that they would take the time from their busy schedules to concentrate on their presentations. Zafar Khan took the lead in Lahore and helped participants in Karachi via phone and email as well. I had to soothe the feathers of the Chief Mentor when he thought that nominees were not responding as quickly as he wanted them to. People like Rabia Garib and Talea Zafar put in time to help with storyboarding and presentation preparations for a couple of the participants. Powerpoints went back and forth from Lahore and Islamabad to Karachi and several iterations later they were still being fine-tuned.\n\nAt APICTA I wear 3 hats \u2013 Economy Coordinator, EXCO Member and Head of Delegation. It requires a lot of multitasking but it is a labour of love and I thoroughly enjoy it. Since I knew that I would not be going this year, I had to make sure that I delegated the work to friends within the delegation.\n\nSadaf Ali from my team at P@SHA, was given the role of Economy Coordinator. I know a couple of our CEC members were a little nervous about a total novice taking on this important task but I had faith in young Sadaf and I am proud to say that my faith was not misplaced. From the time she took on the task weeks before flying to Brunei, she took to it like a duck to water. I was copied on everything so I knew exactly what she was up to. She was pro-active and competent and the feedback from Brunei shows that she did a much better job than I would have. Well done Sadaf!\n\nAnother young woman in the delegation was Syeda Areej Kamal from NED University. She didn\u2019t win in the Tertiary Student Category because there was some extremely tough competition in terms of technology as well as student projects already generating over US$40,000 in revenue. The support that those projects receive in terms of training, participation costs over the year at various events and investment by government in their projects is what helps those kids from countries like Hong Kong to perform brilliantly each year. We need to take a look at what we are missing out on by not offering similar support to our youngsters. However, if you had seen Areej\u2019s presentation, you would be amazed. It wowed our mentors and judges during the late night mentoring sessions at the Empire Hotel in Brunei. They shared it with me and I was blown away. Well done Areej. We are proud of you.\n\nMy EXCO duties were shared by Jawwad, Zafar and Sultan who are very popular at APICTA and who\u2019ve made many friends in the region. They, and Badar Khushnood, have as judges won the respect of counterparts from the Asia Pacific and Pakistan is lucky to have such passionate and dedicated professionals representing us. Badar covers his own costs (as did Faizan Siddiqi this year) to travel to APICTA, to provide great feedback to nominees during the prep sessions and to generally be there as part of the supporting team that projects our country and our industry so phenomenally. Thanks guys. Where would we be without you?\n\nThe Head of Delegation duty was transferred to Sultan Hamdani \u2013 and who better than our Sultan to head a delegation to Brunei. The man is a total charmer and gets people to do whatever is needed whenever its needed and finds creative solutions to any problem that may creep up.\n\nAs you can see, the team was in good hands\u2026 and yet like a mother hen, I worried nonetheless. I kept bugging them with emails and messages on GTalk. The night before the results were announced I didn\u2019t sleep because I was so anxious. First thing in the morning I kept pinging them to ask if there was any news coming out of the Final Judges\u2019 meeting. I was on pins and needles. It was as if my life depended on it. I needn\u2019t have worried though. Team Pakistan didn\u2019t let us down. They held the flag high and did us proud. Thank you guys and girls. Thank you for allowing us to hold our heads up high once again.\n\nTeam Pakistan picks up four Silvers at Empire Hotel in Brunei\n\nMore photos of Team Pakistan from APICTA 2012\n\nSome of the coolest people who were judges at APICTA 2012 from Pakistan", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Well done Team\u00a0P@SHA!"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/the-best-gift-of-all-time/", "text": "The past few months have been tough and although many friends and colleagues have raved about how brave I have been, I have actually been quite scared and have tried to take it one day at a time so that I wouldn\u2019t be overwhelmed. The strategy has worked I think \u2013 at least to some degree.\n\nThe surgery is over. The external staples are out. Internal healing will take another 3 weeks according to the doctor. The histology report has come in and the news is very good. It was indeed very early stage cancer and was contained. The surgeon was able to get it all. There is no sign of it in the lymph nodes or in the surrounding tissue.\n\nMet with the radiation oncologist the other day. He was very positive. He said I was very lucky. The report indicated that I was, what he called, now a low risk patient and hence he did not think that I needed to undergo radiation treatment. I would however need to go in to see my doctor every 2 months for monitoring and examination to ensure that any signs of recurrence were detected early.\n\nTo say that I am relieved would be an understatement. I feel I have been given a new lease on life and I must use this well \u2026. and I intend to. It has been three weeks since my surgery. My doctor says I must rest for another three weeks if I want to avoid long-term repercussions. It is tough to follow her instructions but I am doing it because I know I have to.\n\nYou know, ever since I have started to write about what I am going through, I have heard from friends and colleagues who are survivors or who have family who are going through a similar experience. Some have told me that by sharing my thoughts and feelings, I have helped them be more positive or look at things with a different perspective. That makes me happy. I have always found it therapeutic to write down what I was feeling but I never thought that by doing so, I would also be helping someone else.\n\nTo all those who have prayed for me, who have sent positive vibes, offered advice and support, sent bouquets, books, gifts, cupcakes and fruit, those who have been there every step of the way, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The best gift of all\u00a0time"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2012/11/18/the-challenge-of-a-lifetime/", "text": "This was only the second time that I had been admitted to hospital \u2013 the first being a few years ago when I had dengue and had to spend 4 days at OMI. That was bad enough but this stint has been the most challenging. To be diagnosed with cancer, to have major surgery, to be immobile and dependent, to not know what lies ahead. I have had to muster up all my strength and positivity to get through it this far. There have been many who have helped either from a distance or from being right there every step of the way.\n\nI must admit to being very scared. Going under the knife (scalpel) was not something i was looking forward to. I had watched enough medical shows on television to know that things could go very wrong. The consent form i had signed spelt out all the possible risks. I would have to be stupid not to be scared. Nonetheless I put up a bravado and maintained a sense of humour for the sake of family and friends. The fact that I had cancer had already traumatised them. If they saw how terrified I was they would not be able to handle it. I did however ask my old friend Rukhsana to draft out a will for me \u2013 I am not rich but I didn\u2019t want what I do have to go into limbo in case something happened to me.\n\nI was admitted into AKU on the 30th of October. I would be third in line for the surgery the next morning. There were 2 minor operations scheduled prior to mine. As I was taken away on the stretcher at around 10 a.m. my friends followed until they were finally restricted from going any further. I waved goodbye, took a deep breath, said a little prayer and got ready to face what lay ahead.\n\nIn the prep area, my doctor Dr. Aliya Begum Aziz came and spoke to me. She is young, very professional and inspires confidence. I was so glad that she was my surgeon. She explained that the anaesthesiologist would present me with two options \u2013 one was the epidural which was better in terms of pain management post-op. My threshold for pain is extremely low so I opted for the epidural. I do remember asking the well- spoken and pleasant anaesthesiologist if there was any risk associated with the procedure. He assured me there was not. Of course implanting the epidural took some time and several attempts due to my body mass (note \u2013 must try and lose weight).\n\nThankfully, the next thing I remember is seeing my doctor through a haze telling me that although the surgery had taken 3 1/2 hours, it had been totally successful; that she had managed to take out all the cancerous bits and the disease seemed to be contained and early- stage. She looked happy. That must be good, I thought to myself.\n\nIn the recovery room, I remember seeing my friends Afia and Rukhsana reassuring me and asking how I was. I must have dozed off after that until they moved me to the Special Care Unit where I was tied to machines and tubes which monitored my progress post-op. Quite a scary sight!\n\nFast forward to 18 hours later when I was moved to my room because the doc thought my condition was stable enough.\n\nThe next few days were tough. I had always been the caregiver, never the patient, so this was a new experience for me. I had never felt so dependent on others. My Chief Attendant, Afia Salam \u2013 a friend for decades \u2013 was a blessing. Having been through this herself, she knew what to watch out for. She also knew when not to panic and transferred much of that calmness to me. Other than one day when I remember being a grouch, I think I was a pretty good patient.\n\nAfia stayed with me at the hospital and took on the duties of Executive Secretary answering all the enquiries regarding my health, putting up health updates on Facebook and Twitter so that family, friends and well-wishers would know how I was doing. Some of these were photo updates. She screened all my calls. My Florence Nightingale team also included Nuzhat, Rukhsana, Farieha, Sana and Seema all of whom took out time to be with me, to provide cheer and support.\n\nFamily is very important when you are going through a rough time. My siblings were a great source of strength and support through this period. They kept in touch letting me know that they were there for me and that everything would be okay. My brother Samar and his wife Faiza came over from London and spent some time with me prior to the surgery. They also insisted that I have my room refurnished and wrote out a cheque so that I would be pressurised into getting it done.\n\nMy brother Zafar who is a very busy chap and never leaves his office for more than a few days at a time, flew to Karachi from Hong Kong to be with my father during my hospitalisation so that I would not worry. He also came to the hospital daily and other than spending time with me, brought various gadgets to cheer me up \u2013 the primary one being the new iPad Mini. Wow! That really brought a smile to my face.\n\nMy uncles, aunts, cousins (especially the ones who are doctors) offered support and advice pre-op as well as post-op.\n\nI spent 8 days in the hospital. Some of these were extremely rough \u2013 the pain, the nausea, the weakness, the dependence, needles being poked into me \u2013 it was all quite challenging. I don\u2019t think I would have got through it if not for the prayers, support and good wishes of friends and family, the bouquets, \u00a0the calls , the visits that Afia \u201chitler\u201d Salam allowed :).\n\nSeveral things occurred to me as I lay in that hospital bed:\n\n 1. How had my dearest mother gone through so many years of illness and hospitalizations and retained her sense of humour?\n\n 2. Ammi had been right about how lucky we are to be able to afford such good healthcare. If we still went through so much discomfort, what happened to those who couldn\u2019t afford these facilities?\n\n 3. Men and women who are not compassionate and who don\u2019t consider nursing as a mission, should not become nurses. When a person is ill they need gentle, tender, loving care coupled with professionalism. Nurses can make a patient\u2019s stay a pleasant bearable one or \u00a0a nightmare from hell.\n\n 4. When you keep telling someone who is going through pain that it will be okay, it doesn\u2019t help. All it results in is silly platitudes that eventually tend to irritate.\n\n 5. When someone tells you that they can\u2019t eat or drink something, listen to them. Their body is telling them that there is some reason why it won\u2019t accept food or drink. Don\u2019t insist!\n\n 6. Do what the doctor says! Sit up, walk, do your exercises. The healing will be quicker. \n\n 7. Hospitals should have more nurses to go around. It is a tough job and for them to do it well, they need to be well rested.\n\n 8. Hospitals should have better chefs. This is when patients need palatable food the most.\n\nWhile I was in hospital, my two activists-turned-interior designers, Farieha and Sana, re-furnished my room. Technology was used at every stage as they sent pictures of bookshelves, mirrors, cushions, bedspreads etc on What\u2019s App and got my approval. They even used Skype to show me the designs of the blinds. By the time I got home the room was re-done. My brother had helped by putting rods in the bathroom and by installing the television on the wall of the bedroom. It was all made very comfortable for me.\n\nI have always known this but the one thing that has been re-established in my mind and in my heart is that I am extremely fortunate to have so many people in my life who care about me and are willing to rally around whenever I need help. They are there to share in my joys and are there to offer prayers and support through the most challenging times. That is such a blessing. To say thank you would never be enough. From the core of my being I pray that they are showered with God\u2019s blessings always.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The challenge of a\u00a0lifetime"},

It meant hospitalization for the day, general anesthesia, a procedure followed by a biopsy. But there was no choice so I got it done. Everyone assured me that I was worrying about nothing and the tissue would be benign. I wanted so much to believe that and convinced myself that it would indeed not be malignant. I discharged myself from hospital at 2 a.m. and went home rather than spend the night much to the chagrin of Afia Salam who was staying with me. Like most normal people, I don\u2019t like hospitals and wanted to be out as soon as possible.\n\nA week or so passed following the D&C and it was after attending an event in Karachi, that I went to collect my biopsy report from the AKU collection center at Teen Talwar in Clifton to find out what the verdict was. As happens with most medical reports, this report, with all its medical jargon, meant very little to me. However, the words\u00a0Endometriod Adenocarcinoma\u00a0raised a red flag in my brain \u2013 didn\u2019t \u2018carcinoma\u2019 have some connection with cancer? I tried not to think about it as I drove home. As soon as I got there, I typed Endometriod Adenocarcinoma in Google Search \u2013 and the words cancer\u00a0were the first words that popped up. As the realization engulfed me, the tears started to flow down my cheeks. I let it all out and then the brain started to function. I needed to find out how serious it was, had to fight it, had to deal with it \u2013 not so much for my own sake as much as Abbaji\u2019s. Who would take care of him if I wasn\u2019t around? He needed me. For his sake I had to get well, I kept telling myself.\n\nAnyway, I had to push everything out of my head for a few days because the next morning I was leaving for Istanbul to attend the Turkish ICT Summit. I had committed to going there on behalf of P@SHA and so off I went. Tried to keep thoughts of \u00a0the diagnosis at the back of my mind and to concentrate on the networking and on the conference proceedings and on seeing Istanbul for the first time. But that story is for another time.\n\nBack in Karachi four days later, I called the oncologist. She checked out the report I sent by email, told me it was indeed cancer but that it appeared to be stage 1. She asked me to immediately get a CT Scan and MRI done so she could assess the extent to which the cancer had spread if it had.\n\nEven though several of my dear friends have struggled with this disease \u2013 some have conquered it while others haven\u2019t, I was not ready \u00a0to be told that I was suffering from cancer.\u00a0Like most people, I had lived under the illusion that this type of thing only happened to other people \u2013 until one day it happened to me.\n\nAnyway, I had to accept it and deal with it. So off I went for the CT Scan and the MRI. Thank God for dear friends who accompanied me for doctor\u2019s visits, tests and follow ups. Some showed up with chocolate cake to cheer me up. Others showed up to crack a joke or two to distract me from the seriousness of this disease and what awaited me. Thank God also for my siblings & extended family and friends who offered their love, understanding and support and the P@SHA Chairman, Central Executive Committee and my team at the Secretariat all of whom told me to focus on getting well while they would take care of P@SHA and its activities.\n\nThe CT Scan and MRI indicated that the cancer hadn\u2019t spread. The oncologist looked at all the reports and said that I would need surgery \u2013 a complete hysterectomy \u2013 which would possibly have to be followed by several cycles of radiation but she said the prognosis was good. It appeared that we had caught it early and although the surgery and follow up treatment would be rough as would the recuperation, I should come through it okay. Of course she would only be really sure of the extent of it once she operated.\n\nThe surgery could have been done right away but my haemoglobin count was low so the doctor said that I should bump that up with iron, folic acid and a better diet and scheduled surgery for October 15. This suited me since the P@SHA Annual ICT Awards and Conference were scheduled for October 10 \u2013 yes I was worried about that! I focused on preparations for the events and tried to keep my mind off the cancer but at the same time I worked on increasing my iron intake.\n\nI kept my spirits high and, other than a close inner circle, no-one knew what I was going through.\n\nThe surgery was further delayed by another week due to an infection which had to be treated with strong antibiotics but finally today I was admitted to Aga Khan Hospital (AKU). The surgery is scheduled for tomorrow morning. I will be in hospital for at least 6 days and will probably need a few weeks of recuperation time after that \u2013 before the radiation cycles are started.\n\nTo all those who have been calling and emailing and wondering why I won\u2019t schedule anything for the next few weeks, you now have your answer. I hope you understand and will give me the space and time that I need to fight this.\n\nMy doctor says I can be on my iPad 24 hours after the surgery if I am up to it so you may start seeing updates very soon after I have been cut up and released from the Special Care Unit.\n\nTo all those who have been around the past few weeks seeing me through this tough period \u00a0providing love and support, accompanying me for doctors\u2019 visits and a plethora of tests, bringing me cakes, taking me for nice lunches, making sure I continued to smile and stayed positive and, most important of all, praying for my health and my quick and complete recovery \u2013 all I can say is thank you. It is great to have so many people in your life who care so much. That is what gives me strength and enables me to continue smiling and laughing.\n\nTo Sultan Hamdani and Atif Mumtaz, thank you for your prayers at Mecca during the Hajj. To Norbert Almeida and Raza \u2013 thanks for bleeding for me (donating blood) at such short notice. We\u2019ll all party once this is all over! :-).

More important than that was the opportunity it provided for me to speak about the entrepreneurial scene in Pakistan and the innovation taking place in the Pakistan IT sector.\n\nDetails to follow but I thought that in the meantime, I would put up the video of the global panel which comprised some very interesting panelists who had a great deal of expertise to share.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "It\u2019s a Startup World panel at Google I/O in San\u00a0Francisco"},

God that irritated me beyond belief! Did someone actually think it was clever?\n\nThen there is the HBL ad with the Pakistani version of \u201cMr. Bean\u201d. Does the bank really believe that someone will open an account in HBL as a result of his antics in this ad? Or is it just recall that they are aiming for, not call to action. Come on guys! Don\u2019t forget the end goal!\n\nPublic service advertising is no better \u2013 have you heard the polio awareness ad in which Shahid Afridi asks if you want to gift your son a set of crutches or a cricket bat? I guess it is supposed to shock parents into getting their children the polio drops but somehow it doesn\u2019t resonate with me on two levels \u2013 first of all the same message could have been delivered in a less crude fashion and secondly it appears to say that only the boy child needs to be protected from polio. The general idea of having someone of Afridi\u2019s profile tell people to get polio vaccination for their kids is a good one but it needed to be scripted better.\n\nAnd if it isn\u2019t the quality of advertising, it is the frequency. Why do advertisers or their ad agencies believe that I want to watch or listen to the same ad several times in the space of a couple of minutes in succession. If anything, it puts me off the product that is being sold or irritates me into turning off the radio or television channel.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Ads are driving me\u00a0insane!"},

Rita M. DeSouza was one such person. Learning of her death on May 25 at the age of 92 made me feel a sense of deep personal loss. She was a good soul who did so much for so many. I was sorry that since i was traveling I could not attend her funeral and pay my last respects. She had been a part of my life since High School as the Principal of St. Lawrence\u2019s School in Karachi but our relationship did not stop there.\n\nIt has been a long time since I graduated from High School but throughout my college and university years and then as I entered professional life, Rita DeSouza was always there taking pride in whatever I achieved and guiding my development. She was the kind of educationalist who cared about her students, about the young people under her care, someone who followed their careers with a great deal of interest and took pleasure in their success and in their achievements.\n\nA group of us who were in school together visited her regularly on her birthday, at Easter, at Christmas and New Year. She looked forward to our visits with great anticipation and often told her family and friends about this \u201cspecial group of former students\u201d. She never forgot to call us on special occasions like Eid to wish us Eid Mubarak. Whenever she saw anything about us in the newspapers or saw an interview on television, she would call and say how proud she was of what we had done and the way in which we had conducted ourselves. Her praise always meant so much because it was honest and sincere.\n\nRita DeSouza was a wonderful conversationalist. Each discourse with her taught you something new but she was also a great listener (a quality very few have). We talked to her about everything \u2013 our careers, our personal lives, our problems, our challenges, our successes, our failures. And the advice she gave very often helped us look at things from a different perspective and discover new solutions.\n\nRita DeSouza was an amazing human being. She was a great teacher, an efficient administrator, a role model for many, a humanist, a caring and loving person and a mentor and guide. She cared so much about this country and never really wanted to live anywhere else even though she was not short of options. Of late she had been very concerned about the political and societal changes taking place around us. She was also concerned about the quality of education and tried to do whatever she could to advise and work with various groups to improve the standards. She was a strong member of the community and an active participant. She was often seen visiting people who were old and sick or who needed attention.\n\nI remember when I last visited her she was bedridden but still mentally alert. Her kidneys were giving up. The doctors had advised that she undergo dialysis but she had refused. She was adamant that she had lived a very full life and wanted to leave this world with dignity and grace and not tied to a machine. Those of us who knew her and loved her respected her decision.\n\nRita DeSouza had always been a fighter, a very strong human being. She had overcome a number of medical problems but had remained active and independent even after her husband Cyril\u2019s demise. She wanted to die the way she had lived \u2013 with courage and grace. She didn\u2019t want to linger and I am so glad she got her wish. We will of course miss her but the memories will sustain us and she will no doubt continue to live through the many young people whose lives she guided and whose values and ethics are strong because of her.\n\nFarewell Mrs. DeSouza! You will always be remembered. You were a wonderful role model, a tremendous mentor and a great friend to all who knew you. You will continue to live in our memory and in our hearts. Rest \u00a0in Peace. God has a special place in heaven for people like you.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "In Memory of Rita M.\u00a0DeSouza"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2012/05/18/making-learning-fun/", "text": "Many of us have often had heated conversations about the difference between education and learning; about the dire need for making education a fun experience; about bringing learning to life instead of letting it lie between the pages of a book. With multimedia, interactive learning and initiatives like the Khan Academy, thi s is indeed beginning to happen in some small way \u2013 probably not fast enough or widely enough \u2013 but nonetheless it is happening and that\u2019s wonderful to see.\n\nAnother area of concern for many of us has been the lack of an attempt on the part of government and educationalists to focus on creating a passion and interest for science and technology amongst the young in our country. This is of course not restricted to Pakistan. All over the world there is concern that not enough young people (especially young girls) are opting for the sciences.\n\nIt was therefore a pleasure to visit the Robotics Labs in Karachi and see the kind of things they are involved in. The Robotics Lab is a high tech initiative targeted \n\n towards the young generation of Pakistan who want to develop a passion for Science. At the lab the kids have the opportunity and resources to learn cutting edge technologies in Robotics, Programming, iPad Game Development, 3D Scanning, 3D Modeling, 3D Printing and many more through interesting workshops held throughout the year. The children get to use the state-of-the-art equipment including laptops, robotics kits and high-end software. The modern, secure, air-conditioned facility offers an un-interrupted power supply and has \u00a0high speed access to the Internet.\n\nThe vision of the Robotics Labs, according to co-founders Afaque Ahmed and Yasin Altaf, is to create a learning environment for children where they can come, learn and get exposure to \u00a0\u201cpractical science\u201d. With the world changing at a fast pace and technology taking over literally all aspects of our lives, it is imperative that our children are taught and given such hands-on opportunities from an early age. They are also able to determine which areas are of particular interest to them so that when they are choosing a discipline in high school or college level, they are aware of the opportunities in science and technology that are open to them.\n\nIn order to create awareness amongst students and parents in Karachi, the Robotics Lab has been hosting field trips for schools in which the students are given hands-on experience of Robotics. Besides this, most of the courses are also offered in after school workshops and in summer/winter camps. The Robotics field trips have been very popular amongst both children and their teachers.\n\nOur objective is to create a \u2018National Impact\u2019 through Robotics education and equip the young generation with the multi-dimensional abilities required of them in the 21st century, say the founders of the lab. If you have a child or a neice or nephew or a younger brother or sister who is free this summer, it is worth looking at enrolling them into the summer camp. You will be surprised at how much they learn and how excited they get about the potential use of science and technology in the real world.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Making learning fun!"},

I think the thought was a good one but the basic thing that they forgot to focus on was \u201cKnow your customer\u201d. Considering how much information banks get from you when you open an account, it is easy for them to know the interests/age/gender/profession of a person.\n\nMany girls/women are interested in cricket. I am a great cricket fan but I have never played the game and at my age, I am not likely to. So the helmet and ball could be put on a shelf in my office for decorative purposes but that would mean they would lose their utility totally \u2026 and that would be a waste. So I have decided that I will give the helmet to the first person who asked me \u2013 Sabeen Mahmud. Yes Sabeen, you will be the lucky recipient of the helmet!

How, you might ask?\n\nIf you drive on the streets \u00a0of Karachi, you will be no stranger to the fact that as you are driving quietly and sedately on an open road, a child (or an adult) suddenly jumps in front of your car without any warning. This happens to me several times a day as I drive through the city. My reflexes have to be excellent so that I don\u2019t run over one of these daring (or should I say foolishly unaware and unconcerned) people. Should I, God Forbid, fail to slam my foot on the brake in the nick of time, I would surely be accused of being an elite car owner with little compassion for the poor citizen who walks the street. So every day I stay alert as I drive on the roads of the city fully aware that I might need to suddenly stop to \u201csave the life\u201d of someone who has decided to \u00a0step in front of my car on the freeway or jumped out suddenly from within one of the bushes or trees on one of the major roads.\n\nAs if this responsibility were not enough to keep ones nerves on edge, there is yet another danger that lurks \u2013 and that, my friends, is our friendly neighbourhood motorcyclist or rickshaw driver. The motorcyclist whizzes in from the right or the left or from a narrow lane that is perpendicular to the main road you may be driving on and then continues to drive like a daredevil in front of buses, cars, trucks or containers seemingly daring one of them to knock him down. Sometimes, these bikes have 4 passengers in addition to the person who is the driver; many of them have not even bothered to don their helmets so saving their lives is your responsibility.\n\nThere are some daring individuals whose behaviour is even more extreme. These are chaps who decide to attempt driving their bikes lying down or standing on the seat or at time positioning the bike vertically pointing toward the sky. It is difficult to fathom why they do this. Perhaps the adrenaline rush gives them the high they are looking for. The question is it is worth risking your life and the lives of other over some silly stunt. I don\u2019t think it is but then what do I know?\n\nAll i wanted to say way that I saved another life today. Did you?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "I saved a life\u00a0today!"},

She derived her happiness from ours; she felt the pain of every heartbreak we felt while we were growing up. She was married very young and more or less grew up with us. She was more than just our mother and our guardian angel. She was our best friend.\n\nAmmi was the glue that held us together. Even through her many years of illness she was patient and never complained. She was always worried how her illness affected us and usufally shrugged off her own pain. The smile she wore almost every day of her life was quick and warm and genuine and encompassed everyone. No matter what anyone said or did to her, she never held it against them. She was forgiveness personified. In fact she usually made excuses for the nasty behaviour of others.\n\nIt\u2019s been 9 years since she was taken from us and you would think that we would feel her absence less but nothing is further from the truth. Whenever anything good happens in my life I wish she was there to share in the moment. When someone hurts my feelings, I wish she were there to make me feel better. Her smile and comforting tone were always the cure for anything that ever ailed any of us. She was the special angel who watched over us every moment of our lives.\n\nShe was quite ill for over two decades yet she didn\u2019t lose her sense of humour. She cracked jokes all the time to lighten the atmosphere, to make people forget the seriousness of a moment. She liked seeing people happy and couldn\u2019t bear to see anyone in pain. Ammi often spoke about how fortunate we were to have the kind of healthcare we did because of Abbaji\u2019s job and benefits. She often prayed to God asking him never to let illness befall a poor man or woman. She was so sensitive to other peoples pain and their needs. Of course this resulted in a lot of people taking advantage of her good nature and her compassion. But she didn\u2019t seem to mind. She said that if they felt the necessity to lie, they must have been really desperate and we should forgive them.\n\nAmmi, your love lives within us and we feel your presence around us whatever we do. I think you continue to watch over Abbaji and us from the heavens. We miss you so much. It is our love for you that binds us together and nudges us to look after one another. We are who you and Abbaji brought us up to be and I hope you will always be proud of us and of the things we do. We honour your memory each time we do something good, something decent, something loving. Thank you for giving us the best years of your life and for loving us with the depth that you did.

Look at the pictures below to witness what was revealed when the carton was opened.\n\nYes bananas! You must be wondering why the hell someone would bring bananas from Hong Kong.

The portal, as all things wi-tribe, is slick and the User Interface is very simple to use. This is in beta so developers are warned that there might be a few bugs \u2013 and these should be reported so that they can be fixed.\n\nThe basic categories that they have defined in the portal include:\n\nSo all a software developer has to do is fill in the details in the online application form, mention the price, provide a description, the OS the app runs on and send it to w-tribe alongwith a sign up fee of Rs. 1000. According to the information on the portal, wi-tribe will get a contract to the developer within 7 days. In accordance with the contract, the developer will get 65% of all revenues minus taxes. There are some pre-requisites though. The software must have had a minimum of 100 downloads and should have been on the portal for at least 3 months.\u00a0The shopping experience for buyers is very simple \u2013 add to shopping cart, use the scratch card and download! You can also create a wish list if you are not sure how many products you want to end up buying.\n\nAccording to Ali Fahd, Director Marketing wi-tribe, the wi-tribe Bazaar is powered by wi-tribe scratch cards, allowing the purchase of software through scratch cards available at over 600 locations throughout Karachi, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Faisalabad. There is no hassle or requirement of credit cards or other e-commerce payment methods. Understanding the Pakistani market, they are aware of the fact that consumers in Pakistan are familiar with scratch cards and use them frequently for various services. So why not software?\n\n\u201cwi-tribe Bazaar is our effort to support, encourage and proliferate the local IT industry and software developers in particular,\u201d says Ali Fahd. \u201cWe understand that there are a lot of developers with products that they would like to sell in the local market. We are also aware of the challenges in monetizing software and applications (apps) in Pakistan. With wi-tribe Bazaar, software developers will enjoy a significant portion of the revenue share as the main beneficiary. The software and apps can be priced at Rs.100, Rs.250, Rs.500 or Rs.1,000 by the developer. wi-tribe Bazaar also offers hundreds of free applications, which will support developers in building and reaching a larger market.\u201d\n\nCurrently, wi-tribe Bazaar supports Windows Desktop and Mobile Apps for\u00a0Android, Blackberry and Symbian. It is a robust platform for selling any windows software and mobile applications such as games, system utilities, wallpapers and customized themes. The platform is open to all types of developers who would like to bring either their commercial product or even a final year university project to their target market, says Ali Fahd.\n\nwi-tribe state that they are only acting as a catalyst by providing the platform. To help build a local ecosystem of software and apps, wi-tribe has taken a conscious decision to open the platform to all \u2013 not just to wi-tribe users.

He said that all over the world universities are the research grounds for a lot of industry innovation and this needs to happen more in Pakistan.\n\nAt KICS-UET, researchers are keen on capitalizing open source technologies and developing cost effective solutions for local telecom and IT industry, said Dr. Waqar Mahmood, Director of KICS-UET. wi-cam is a product built with local talent and it has helped KICS-UET researchers better understand software needs of the telecom industry, he said.\n\nUET has established collaboration with international research organization of high repute such as Broad Institute of MiT Harvard, International Development Research Centre (IDRC) Canada, University of California Barkley, Purdue University USA, Caviam Networks USA, CISCO Systems, European Language Authority, Microsoft research and many others. Several companies have opened their design and training centers in the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore.\u00a0 It has attracted US$8.3M worth of equipment funding from Huawei Technologies China.\n\nwi-tribe should be congratulated for investing in local R&D. It is by increasing the research and development capabilities of our universities that the industry will flourish at a much faster rate and the innovation ecosystem will be further strengthened.\n\nEntry filed under: Posts.

The idea was to check out the Auditorium, the multimedia projection system, the wifi and the sound system to ensure that everything was in good shape for the Interactive Session on \u201cHow to Stay Safe Online\u201d that was scheduled for the next day.\n\nWhy were we concerned? Well, this would be the first event to take place at this new Technology Park and Dr. Umar Saif, the Chairman of the Punjab IT Board, Fasih Mehta the PITB Program Manager and their team had been working 24\u00d77 to make sure that the venue was ready for us in time for the event.\n\nWe needn\u2019t have worried though. Everything was in perfect shape thanks to the great team at PITB. After checking out the Auditorium we went up to Dr. Umar Saif\u2019s office to chit-chat and discuss the program for the next day. The view of Lahore from his office is absolutely breathtaking. You have to see it to believe it! \u00a0The official opening of the Arfa Karim Technology Park will take place in the next couple of weeks. P@SHA will have an office there and I hope that it will soon be populated with a large number of IT companies. Umar Saif has lots of other plans for it but more on that later. Just wanted to share the first few pictures of what looks like a top class facility.\n\nOh by the way, if you are wondering why Badar is playing cowboy, it was cold in Lahore and he tied a scarf round his throat.

Well it seemed only natural to contact Farhan Masood who runs Solotech . His innovative products have been P@SHA ICT Award winners in 2010 and 2011 and have grabbed the Silver award at APICTA\n\nFarhan suggested that we instal his SmartXS hardware and software solution which is selling like hotcakes throughout the country as well as elsewhere.\n\nSolotech\u2019s SmartXS was developed following a pitch that Farhan made at the P@SHA LaunchPad event in Lahore which he in fact won.

He is glad he didn\u2019t listen to the naysayers because today this product generates a large portion of the revenues for Solotech.\n\nAt first I was hesitant about installing this flashy new technology at the Secretariat.

Partners of the event include P@SHA and T2F.\n\nCome prepared to pitch your startup product or prototype. This is an informal meetup of entrepreneurs and promises to be a lot of fun.\n\nSo what is the objective or the thought process behind the ERT event? AR Rafiq, who is an entrepreneur from Silicon Valley, says that\u00a0entrepreneurs deserve more than just 30 seconds or 3 min. to tell the story of the idea and the product that they have passionately developed out of their love for technology and nights and days without sleep or rest.\n\nEntrepreneurs Roundtable began in Silicon Valley. The idea was for startup founders/geeks with more focus in the Software, Web, and Mobile space, to meet every month and\u00a0genuinely share ideas, technical expertise, business experiences, to vent and of course to network. Sometimes ideas attract investment from other attendees and that is really the aim \u2013 partnerships, growth, scalability, investment, sharing and learning.\n\nEach entrepreneur is put under the spotlight, either as a speaker to demo or as a participant.\n\nAccording to AR Rafiq, those who attend must fit the following criteria:\n\n\u2014 Out of four functional roles : Founder, Entrepreneur, Developers, Self-inflicted-slave-driver, you have to play at least 3 out of the four leading title roles above. Honestly, if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll probably get seriously bored by our meetings.\n\n\u2014\u00a0Our live demos are for real internet or mobile products. We usually *try* to avoid glossy ppt stuff, although with exceptions from time to time.\n\nWe welcome entrepreneurs and geeks to join, so long as you are willing to share your experiences and knowledge too.\n\nIf you\u2019re an entrepreneur or geek with an idea or better working prototype, let us know so we can schedule you in to pitch at the meetup.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/strategy-to-avoid-jinxing-my-new-years-resolutions/", "text": "New Year resolutions have never been quite my thing and every year as friends and colleagues have put together their resolutions, I have had my \u201cbah\u201d \u201chumbug\u201d moments \u2013 telling them there\u2019s no point in making resolutions that they had no intention of keeping. This year too just before the clock struck midnight heralding the onset of a brand new year, I wondered about the many people who would be wasting their time making resolutions only to break them the very next day.\n\nThen something occurred to me. What if I made resolutions the week after New Year\u2019s? Maybe they wouldn\u2019t be jinxed and there would be a better chance of living up to them. Why make them at all you might ask? There is a loony rationale to it actually. When you focus on what you need to do to improve your personal and work life, your relationships, the way you function as a human being, you actually take the time to stop and think, to highlight in your mind your priorities and ways to better lead your own life and impact the lives of those around you.\n\nSo I relaxed on my beanbag, closed my eyes and thought of things I would like to change. Here is a list of 10 resolutions that I came up with.\n\n1. Try and be more patient \u2013 God do I need this!\n\nTake a deep breath before reacting in annoyance to anything that happens. There are any number of times one reacts in anger to something someone may have said or done. Regrets are of no use later so might as well ponder before reacting.\n\n2. Focus on a few things, make them happen first and then embark on other activities\n\nPassion and excitement are great but they often lead to total chaos if one is not careful. Balance is important, and the ability to recognize how much one can execute during a given time frame.\n\n3. Get back to blogging more regularly\n\nI enjoy writing/blogging so much but of late I have let life get the better of me \u2013 and have neglected my blog. That is just not on. I need to get back to regular blogging. It is one of the things that has kept me sane over the years (yes yes it may be hard to believe but I am quite sane :))\n\n4. Take a day off every week\n\nThe rollercoaster ride I have been on 24\u00d77 for the past few years has turned me into a workaholic and is beginning to take its toll. Need to take at least a day off every week to unwind, laze, just chill!\n\nNo no not mine! Energy as in power. Make sure all switches in the house are off when they are not in use, that all lights, fans, ACs in the office are off when the team heads out for lunch or when i go out for meetings. Emphasize on household and office teams of the importance of saving energy.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean I am going on a diet. It only means that I will eat oily or deep fried foods, sweets, etc less often. Concentrate on lunches which comprise of soup and/salads and the day I have a heavier lunch, have the soup/salad for dinner. So eating healthier as often as I can without depriving myself of food I enjoy.\n\nThis is to keep the body from rusting and getting squeaky. Needs to keep functioning if I am to do all the things I want to.\n\nHave been thinking about this for so long. About time I stopped procrastinating and actually did it! This is the year! :)\n\nEnsure all initiatives are documented and shared. Blowing your own trumpet (in so far as the organization you work for is concerned) is actually a good thing and is in fact essential good practice.\n\nDon\u2019t let the insensitivity and negativity of a few individuals weigh you down.

He said that to stop violence against women, it is not sufficient that we create awareness about womens\u2019 rights among women \u2013 it is absolutely essential that men join alongside women to encourage norms of consent, respect and gender equality and that they challenge the unfair power relations which leads to violence.\n\nHe also announced the launch of a nationwide journalists\u2019 engagement program on gender sensitization and violence against women and said that a White Ribbon Media Alumni was being established.\n\nWhite Ribbon Campaign Pakistan \u2013 WRCP is a project of the Women\u2019s Empowerment Group and Vision 2015, working with men and boys to eradicate women\u2019s human rights violations.\n\nSome of the major things that have been done by WRCP include:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mass distribution of awareness material for Men & Boys on ending VAW\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nationwide Media Campaign in Daily Jang, The News & GEO News to mark White Ribbon Day on 25th Nov.\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Circulation of\u00a0SMS condemning violence against women on 25th Nov to 3.0 million Warid subscribers\n\nSo since this is a worldwide campaign I decided to check out their main website more details so that we could all understand what it is that they are trying to accomplish. I was quite amazed at the size of the campaign and its outreach. It is an effort that started in Canada and has spread to 55 countries. Here are some of the basic questions that the website was able to answer regarding the White Ribbon Campaign, how it started, what it means to wear a white ribbon and how they are trying to ensure that their mission is accomplished.\n\nWhat is the White Ribbon Campaign (WRC)?\n\n The White Ribbon Campaign (WRC) is the largest effort in the world of men working to end violence against women (VAW). In over fifty-five countries, campaigns are led by both men and women, even though the focus is on educating men and boys. In some countries it is a general public education effort focused on ending violence against women.\n\nHow did the WRC get started?\n\n In 1991, a handful of men in Canada decided they had a responsibility to urge men to speak out about violence against women. Wearing a white ribbon would be a symbol of men\u2019s opposition to violence against women. With only six weeks of preparation, 100000 men across Canada wore a white ribbon, while many others were drawn into discussion and debate.\n\nWhat does it mean to wear a white ribbon?\n\n Wearing a white ribbon is a personal pledge to never commit, condone or remain silent about violence against women and girls. Wearing a white ribbon is a way of saying, \u201cOur future has no violence against women.\u201d\n\nWhat is the goal of WRC? How is this accomplished?\n\n The main goal of WRC is ending violence against women in all its forms. We accomplish this in five ways:\n\nEntry filed under: Posts.

According to its curator Niilofur Farrukh, it began as an attempt to fight the helplessness that had gripped society when news of the murders broke.\n\nDedicated to the four women who were buried alive in Naseerabad, the exhibition, which went on display at the VM Gallery last month, showcases the work of 35 artists \u2013 some very well known, others young and upcoming \u2013 with each work exploring a different dimension of violence against women.\n\nThe first work that catches the eye comprises two white muslin sheets suspended from the ceiling covered with fiery orange text and screen print. Titled \u2018Wajud-e-zan say hai tasveer-i-kainat mein rang,\u2019 artist Meher Afroz conveys her thoughts on \u2018honour\u2019 killings through the use of specific words and phrases on her canvas. Words such as amal, masawaat, akhuwat, yaqeen, rawadari are scattered around a poem that reads: Nai ho ya purani/ zann ka nigehban hai faqat mard/ jis qaum ne iss zinda haqeeqat/ ko na paya/ uss qaum ka khursheed bohat jaldi/ huwa zard.\n\n\u2018Honour\u2019 by Khuda Bux Abro features moustaches floating around a burqa-clad woman. Men who brandish these moustaches \u2013 which are viewed as a source of pride and honour in society \u2013 think nothing of laying to waste a woman\u2019s life in the name of honour. The painting depicts the entrapment of women by such men and their code of honour.\n\nIn Naima Dadabhoy\u2019s work, a screen print on canvas, the map of Pakistan placed at the centre of the canvas, is surrounded by text that documents facts, figures and perceptions relating to \u2018honour\u2019 killings. More impressive, however, is Dadabhoy\u2019s life-size skeletal structure of a woman resembling a mummy lying on the floor in wrought iron and tin foil \u2013 much like a corpse in a coffin.\n\nMaham Mujtaba depicts the debasement of the concept of honour by draping a wild boar in her painting with a red sheet that has the word \u2018honour\u2019 embroidered on it. The background shows 18 women wrapped in white sheets \u2013 all victims of \u2018honour\u2019 killings.\n\nWhat look like two double-sided axes strung on the wall are the product of a collaborative effort by Abdullah Syed, an artist based in Sydney, and Roohi Ahmed, currently a teacher at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture. Titled \u2018Kullah-Re,\u2019 on one side of the wooden stick is the metal component of an axe whereas on the other is a kullah (form of turban) made of fabric. Together, they denote the perpetrator of violence and the tool he uses to perpetrate it \u2013 the tribal lord and the axe.\n\nCovering most of the wall space on one side of the gallery, Marium Agha\u2019s \u201872 virgins for my suicide lover,\u2019 references the promise of 72 virgins to all martyrs in a Hadith in an unusually interesting manner. Instead of using figurines, Agha uses biological sketches of the vagina to illustrate the reduction of women to mere objects, offered as reward in heaven \u2013 and on earth.\n\nStrikingly different is Maria Aftab\u2019s work in mixed media. Done in bright red fabric with a checkered rug on the floor and a floral design on the wall, Aftab\u2019s bathroom scene and fittings \u2013 a sink and a mirror with a towel rack next to it \u2013 according to her represent \u201citems of daily use \u2026 which usually provide comfort yet simultaneously give the effect of a nightmare.\u201d\n\nOn a more positive note, Sana Arjumand uses a portrait of a woman wearing a crown to depict Mukhtaran Mai. It is her way of paying tribute to a woman who was the victim of a heinous crime \u2013 gang-rape \u2013 but stood strong in the face of slander, threat and coercion and came out of the trauma as a stronger and better person \u2013 a role model for victims of similar tragedy.\n\n\u201cAt some level or the other, art communicates \u2013 sometimes directly and at other times, not so much,\u201d remarked Farrukh of the show. According to her, the aim of the exhibition was to dispel the widely held notion \u201cthat art is merely an elitist activity and expresses itself in an esoteric idiom.\u201d In her address at the two-hour discussion/dialogue prior to the exhibition\u2019s inauguration in Karachi on December 6, Farrukh stated that the initiative aimed to do three things: take the exhibition to different parts of the country, include the work of local artists and initiate a dialogue.\n\nWhile the exhibition could not travel to several cities listed on the scheduled programme due to the worsening law-and-order situation in the country, it made it to Jamshoro, Khairpur, Islamabad, Lahore and finally Karachi. Similar discussions as the one in Karachi were held at these locations. Most of the students, particularly those in Jamshoro and Khairpur, were well aware of the crimes committed in the name of honour and the perceptions that existed in their respective societies. Not only were they very forthcoming in their discussions, but also contributed to the exhibition \u2013 selected works were added to the core exhibition.\n\nAt the event in Karachi, after the screening of Beena Sarwar\u2019s nine-minute award-winning documentary Mukhtaran Mai: A Struggle for Justice, several speakers addressed the audience. Khadija from Shirkat Gah, one of the researchers who travelled to Naseerabad on a fact-finding mission, presented an overview of the widely practiced \u2013 and accepted \u2013 cultural practices in Naseerabad and its five adjoining districts. She said watta-satta, siyakari and karo-kari were rampant in the areas. Women were killed in the name of family honour \u2013 even on the pretext of leaving home unaccompanied or without the permission of a male member \u2013 and commonly used as barter for hefty sums of money\n\nAmar Sindhu, an activist from Hyderabad, added to the discussion by informing the audience that the notion that the jirga system provides \u201ccheap and easy justice,\u201d did not hold true. As much as 1 crore 16 lakh rupees has been given as compensation money to settle disputes. \u2018Honour\u2019 crimes, said Sindhu, had become part of the country\u2019s political economy, with feudal lords \u2013 some of whom are sitting in the assemblies \u2013 getting a percentage of the compensation money. Sindhu added that the perpetration of these crimes against women in particular was due to a lack of female representation in the jirgas. She gave the example of a female politician from Sindh, who despite being an elected representative of the area, was not allowed to intervene while an all-male jirga was in session. And despite the Sindh High Court\u2019s ban on jirgas in 2004, they still operate, with \u2018honour\u2019 killings rising with each passing year.\n\nPoet and activist, Attiya Dawood recited her poem, \u2018To My Daughter,\u2019 originally written in Sindhi but translated into Urdu, with \u201cpyaar zaroor kerna\u201d being the constant refrain. The floor was then thrown open to the audiences and a lively discussion ensued. One member suggested that events such as these should be held in areas where these crimes are perpetuated instead of urban centres. A female in the audience countered by saying that while women may not be killed as blatantly as they are in rural societies, the concept of family honour is linked to women even in the urban areas.\n\nMoreover, members in the audience pointed out that it was people based in the urban centres who could effect change by approaching the relevant people and authorities, and further through their activism and agitation. The powerful and the influential needed to be converted, for even if they were not sanctioning the crimes directly, they were on occasion guilty of abetting the act. And some anti-women laws needed to be changed, as was pointed out by WAF (Women\u2019s Action Forum) member Nuzhat Kidvai, and other laws in favour of women needed to be implemented.\n\nAll in all, the exhibition-cum-discussion managed to strike the right chord in most hearts.\n\nEntry filed under: Posts.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2011/11/25/winner-validates-funding-decision/", "text": "In April 2010, the Center for Advanced Research in Engineering (CARE) applied to the National ICT R&D Fund for a grant to research and develop an Arrhythmia and Sudden Death Syndrome Detection Hybrid Network Based Telemedicine System. The grant amount was Rs. 13.5 million.\n\nSo what was the problem that they were trying to solve? This is how they explain it.\n\nElectrocardiography (ECG) is one of the tools of cardiac monitoring. The dilemma is that despite the installation of hundreds of ECG machines in hospitals and clinics throughout the country, patients with severe arrhythmic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed or mistreated usually in rural areas due to unavailability of expert cardiologists at the ECG monitoring station. Moreover, most ECG machines presently installed do not have capabilities like High Resolution signal acquisition, remote monitoring, real time data storage and patient database management.\n\nThe project proposed to develop a prototype system to demonstrate geographically distributed installation of network enabled ECG recording and analysis stations with normal and High Resolution digital ECG machines capable of self diagnosing a patient for different arrhythmic abnormalities as well as early detection of risks associated with fatal arrhythmias which can lead to sudden cardiac death by running state of the art signal processing algorithm. The system was to provide 24/7 ECG recording and analysis facility with universal connectivity through dialup, Ethernet, GPRS, Radio and Satellite for connection to the central server located in the Cardiac Control Center (CCC) of a Central Hospital. The system would also have the capability to provide expert opinion to patients with severe arrhythmic abnormalities by transmitting their physiological data to the cardiologists at a central hospital through a universal communication device already developed in CARE. Here the expert cardiologists would receive ECG data and profile of patients with severe arrhythmic abnormalities and suggest treatment in real time. The ECG record and the patient profile would be stored at the server and a database for patients and their cardiac history would be managed for future reference as well as for off-line analysis and data-mining.\n\nThis was the solution that Dr. Shoab Ahmed Khan and his team researched and developed at CARE. This was the solution that won the top prize in the e-Health category in the P@SHA ICT Awards 2011. In November Dr. Shoab, Dr. Zaheer and Dr. Mohsin then accompanied the rest of the innovators from Pakistan, as well as the mentors and judges, to APICTA in Thailand. Here they competed against 162 other products in different categories and in the e-Health category they won hands down and came back with the winners\u2019 trophy.\n\nLast week Dr. Shoab and I went to show the coveted trophy to Dr. Aun Abbas, the CEO of the National ICT R&D Fund. It is important for us to show organizations like the National ICT R&D Fund that their investment in applied research helps innovators in this country to develop technology products that are useful to the citizens of this country and to the world and are actually world class products that can compare with the best in the region.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Winner validates funding\u00a0decision"},

As Pakistan\u2019s name was called again and again earlier this evening at the Asia Pacific ICT Awards (APICTA) 2011, my heart was bursting with pride and a sense of accomplishment. Team work had allowed us to get this far. From the judges, to the mentors \u2013 and the nominees, the innovative products, the presentations, the Q&A, the sleepless nights, the hours of work, rehearsals, dry runs \u2013 it has all been worth it!\n\nPakistan was amongst the leaders at the APICTA event this evening. We were right up there with Hong Kong, Australia and Malaysia. Our friends from around the region came and shook our hands and remarked \u201cPakistan certainly has done well!\u201d One could see the respect in their eyes, one could hear it in their voices. They had recognized the fact that Pakistan had truly arrived!\n\nTeam Pakistan comprised of 18 products which were benchmarking themselves with 162 competing products from the Asia Pacific region. 48 judges spent two long days evaluating and assessing the \u201cbest of the best\u201d fro m the region.\n\nPakistan walked away with two golds in the e-Health and e-Logistics & SCM categories and 5 silvers in the Communication, Financial, Security, E-Inclusion & E-Community and E-Government categories. The Center for Advanced Research in Engineering (CARE) once again swept the Awards with the gold in e-Health and the silver in Communication, Security and E-Government categories. Lumensoft Technologies went for gold in the e-Logistics category with Infotech Group taking the silver in the Financial Apps category and Engro-Orix taking the silver in the E-Inclusion & E-Community category. Complete results have been announced on Jawwad\u2019s blog.\n\nWe had been worrying about those who didn\u2019t quite make it to the top slots from Pakistan but it was great to see how involved they became in celebrating the wins we had. All of them rose to the occasion and surrounded the winners, hugging them, patting them on the back, showing all-in-all how much the wins meant to Pakistan.\n\nThe CARE team comprising of Dr. Shoab Khan, Dr. Zaheer Ahmed and Dr. Mohsin were over the moon. They had worked very hard to get to this stage of the competition this year and as th ey went up to the stage over and over again to claim their rightful awards, several judges went up to them and offered their congratulations, told them how impressive they were and what a great contribution they were making to the country. Some of them offered to work with them, to form collaborations, to help position their products in other countries.\n\nAbdul Aziz, CEO of Lumensoft, was competing for the second time at APICTA with a maturer product and a presentation that was crisp and clear and delivered extremely well. He last presented in Melbourne in 2009. When I asked him what he felt was the difference between his two attempts, he said unabashedly \u201cMy presentation in Melbourne was pathetic \u2013 no wonder I didn\u2019t win!\u201d A great example of a CEO who shed his ego, listened to the advice given by mentors and gave a 100 %. Well done!\n\nThe Infotech team was just as willing to take feedback and incorporate it into the build up for the Awards. Amir and Suresh presented well, answered every question with clarity and gave it their best. The Silver in the Financial Application category is a difficult one to attain because Infotech was up against some stiff competition. Preparation paid off in the end.\n\nThe Engro/Orix team were stupendous in the way they presented Eman in the E-Inclusion and E-Community category. Atif and Zainab put forward a presentation that wowed the judges and got for them the silver. It is a wonderful program and we hope that this win eggs them on to do other more interesting things with technology. As some of us are fond of saying, 125000 technology professionals cannot move ahead into the new developed age without taking the rest of Pakistan with us. It is for this reason that automation products like Eman are extremely important to the development of our community and our rural sector. Thanks guys for a terrific product. We hope to see more from you in the future.\n\nTeam Pakistan did us proud today and we were happy to see that the news brought joy to the faces of many and warmed and thrilled our hearts.\n\nWe have great plans for Brunei in 2012. Let us put the plans in action now!", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Pakistan grab two golds & five silvers at APICTA 2011 in Pattaya\u00a0Thailand"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2011/11/11/team-pakistan-wins-accolades-even-before-the-awards-announcement/", "text": "As we sat together in the Final Judges\u2019 Briefing this morning viewing the results of the APICTA 2011 competition, there were mixed emotions \u2013 a great deal of pride for all those who had embarked on this amazing journey with us and a feeling of satisfaction at the results Team Pakistan has achieved this year. Stephen Lau, an APICTA stalwart and the Chairman of the Hong Kong Computer Society, came over to Jawwad Farid and me and said \u201cIt has\u00a0 been heartening to see how Pakistan\u2019s performance at APICTA has evolved over the years.\u201d He remembered how we had begun with a consolation prize in the form of a \u201cSpecial Mention\u201d at APICTA in Hong Kong in 2004 and another Special Mention at the event in Macau in 2005. Our very first APICTA win had been in Chiang Mai in 2006 and I remember how thrilled we had been to bring the Award home for the first time.\n\nThis was also the year that Alchemy Technologies had participated at APICTA and Jawwad and his team had been absolutely shattered that they hadn\u2019t won. That was when he embarked on his own personal mission (with me as his partner in crime)\u00a0 to ensure that all APICTA participants were coached and mentored prior to their participation even if it meant tort uring them by depriving them of sleep and making them do several dry runs after getting them to turn their presentations around. This has been our practice every year. It starts in Pakistan and goes on till the moment they go before the judging panel. And it works.\n\nEvery year Team Pakistan has brought more and more accolades by performing brilliantly. I speak here of not only the Awards they win. I am referring to the perceptions they change through networking, developing relationships in the region and putting their hearts and souls into presenting their products before distinguished judges from the region.\n\nBill Liu from Singapore walked in on one of our mentoring sessions day before yesterday and remarked \u201cGosh you work them hard! It shows your passion and commitment to the growth of your sector and the people who work in it.\u201d We never miss an opportunity to introduce Bill to the talent from Pakistan. This year he had long conversations with Dr. Shoab Khan from CARE, Salman ul Haq from Tunacode and Abdul Aziz from Lumensoft. One could clearly see how impressed he was at what they had to tell him a bout their products, the innovation, their business models and the breakthroughs they had made. This is what I mean when I say that our teams change perceptions each time they participate.\n\nThe Toffee TV duo of Rabia and Talea won the judges\u2019 hearts not only with their work but also with the \u201cwrapping\u201d that was a part of their presentation. The judge from Indonesia wanted to know why they weren\u2019t thinking of turning their content into Bahasa \u2013 and that if they ever looked at doing it, they should connect with him. He was so thrilled with toffeetv.com that he insisted on having a picture taken with them when the judging session was over. Rabia has so enjoyed the entire experience of preparing for APICTA in the last few weeks that following her presentation she was totally overwhelmed. She came and hugged us and thanked us for \u201callowing her\u201d to be a part of the process. \u201cIt has taught us so much and we have come so far along the roadmap that we had been thinking of embarking on but would never have dreamed of moving along as fast as we have done,\u201d she said. It is statements like these that make everything we do so worthwhile.\n\nJudges and mentors like Jawwad Ahmed Farid, Zafar Khan, Nadeem Aslam Malik, Badar Khushnood, Sultan Hamdani and Zia Imran have played such a vital role in the development of the teams over the years. They are the P@SHA mentors \u2013 they are the ones who throw so much passion and dedication into the exercise and make us a team to watch out for.\n\nThis year we brought 19 products to APICTA to compete with a total of 162 products from the region. In very competitive categories like New Media & Entertainment and E-Learning, we made our presence felt. The Head Judge in the New Media & Entertainment Category \u2013 Kelly Hutchinson from Australia \u2013 said to me yesterday that she was absolutely blown away by our teams and she was thoroughly impressed with the professionalism and talent of fellow-judge Zafar Khan. That was so wonderful to hear.\n\nSalman ul Haq of Tunacode was brilliant and on such a high when we walked out of the R&D category. The judges in his category were impressed at the calibre of his research and with his depth of knowledge. He said to me \u201cIt does not really matter if I win or not. I have knocked their socks off with my research, and I have learnt so much in the process.\u201d That is the spirit young man. We could do with many more like you.\n\nSyed Saad Hussain of Five Rivers Technologies showed off the Photo Editor application that has been the top application in all categories, across all geographies on the Blackberry App store. It is like having a mini Photoshop app on your mobile. The judges actually took pictures, applied filters and manipulated the images with glee. If it hadn\u2019t been for the Augmented Reality solutions that the Hong Kong teams came up with, he had a sure shot at one of the top slots in his category. He did us proud with his impeccable presentation, with the faultless demos and with the confidence that he exuded. Well done Saad!\n\nWhat can one say about the team from CARE? They are professionals with a depth of knowledge that they have accumulated over the years. Having them with us at APICTA has added a new dimension to our entries. Having them as part of our industry has added a new maturity.\n\nI could go on and on but it\u2019s time to get ready for the Awards Dinner event.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2011/11/11/why-cant-i-sleep/", "text": "I am tired, wiped out and sleep deprived. I know I should be in bed fast asleep so that I will be ready to face the day tomorrow. But I can\u2019t sleep. So many thoughts and emotions are racing through my mind as I think about the last few weeks and months of activity leading up to the Asia Pacific ICT Awards in Pattaya, Thailand. We started off as usual with individual winners from different categories in the P@SHA ICT Awards but we have ended up with a synergized team that has held the flag high for Pakistan and the Pakistan ICT industry.\n\nI feel so much pride, so much jo y in what Team Pakistan has achieved over the past few weeks \u2013 and especially the last couple of days. And yet I feel a deep depression too because I know that many of them will not be receiving Awards or Certificates of Merit tomorrow evening. How do I know this? Because it is an impossibility for all nominees from the region to make it to the limited number of top slots in their categories no matter how brilliant they all are.\n\nThere are 160 \u201cwinners\u201d who are here in Pattaya Thailand with products that are each innovative, unique and the best of the best. The format of the Awards is such that only a handful of these innovators will be recognized with trophies and certificates tomorrow evening. The majority will go back with Certificates of Participation indicating that they are amongst the best in the Asia Pacific region. Most will have missed being placed in the top 2 or 3 slots in their categories by as little as 0.05 points. It will be heartbreaking for them. I know because I see it every year \u2013 and it breaks my heart. Tomorrow will be no different and there is nothing I can do about it.\n\nAnd yet as I sit here thinking about the intense effort that all the judges, mentors and nominees have put in over the last few days and nights, about the dedication and commitment shown by each and every team member, I know that they will go back home feeling a sense of satisfaction with the overall experience. They will go back having learnt how to position their products a lot better than they did before they came; they will return home knowing that they benchmarked their products with the best in the region and are second to none; that they have made partners and friends in the ICT community around the region; that many of them have formed friendships with fellow nomine es, judges and mentors that will last a lifetime; that they have during the process of preparing for these Awards, created roadmaps for their products and their companies that will result in tremendous success for them and for the country.\n\nTeam Pakistan has been brilliant. We have seen the respect with which they have been welcomed. We have seen how they have grown in stature. We have seen them work with each other, burning the midnight oil, supporting and encouraging each other and feeling a pride in being here representing Pakistan. That in itself makes me want to hug them all and say \u201cWell done \u2026 you have done us proud!\u201d No matter what the results tomorrow evening, you are all winners in our book and you have brought respect, honour and prestige to the country and to our industry. For that we thank you and salute you.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Why can\u2019t I\u00a0sleep?"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2011/10/28/the-road-to-funding-social-innovation/", "text": "It feels great when things finally start coming together, isn\u2019t it?\n\nWhen Google first gave P@SHA the seed grant of US$250,000 to set up the P@SHA Fund for Social Innovation, we were thrilled at the opportunity this would create for some new entrepreneurial ideas to emerge that would focus on social change and social impact. At the same time we felt the weight of the responsibility and the faith that had been put on us to keep the process totally transparent and merit-based.\n\nThe first thing that Badar Khushnood and I did was talk about the kind of people we should involve \u2013 people who were above board, who would be committed to putting in time and passion and would work with young people to ensure the success of the ideas that were submitted.\n\nWell, we certainly got lucky with our choice of people. Not only do we have an advisory council which comprises of seasoned professionals and community leaders, we also have a panel of judges who are serial entrepreneurs and whose only mission in life seems to be to plant the seed of entrepreneurship amongst the highly energetic and talented young population of this country.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no way I could possibly forget our cool Outreach Gurus who are from the Who\u2019s Who of our mainstream and online media scene, have helped organize activities and have spread the word regarding the Fund through the length and breadth of Pakistan.\n\nThe advisory council has been great in helping us develop strategy, define parameters and have even reined us in when the need arose.\n\nWhat do I say about the judges. Jawwad Ahmed Farid, Zafar Khan and Atif Mumtaz have worked long hours to ensure that they painstakingly went through the 300 entries, assessed the ideas, their likely impact and their ability to deliver. If they had had their way, they would have funded a lot more ideas than this limited funding allows us to.\n\nThey shortlisted around 64 ideas \u00a0and could have just scored on the basis of the entries but they were keen to understand better what it was the nominees wanted to achieve and so they asked for 5 minute videos to be uploaded on YouTube answering 4 key questions. This of course meant that they had to go through all the submitted videos and assess the ideas one more time \u2013 a task they undertook willingly and with an excitement that was great to see. They exchanged notes, discussed the pros and cons, the possible impact, the likelihood of success and the ability of these youngsters to bring about change in their communities. Remember, each of these guys lives in a different city and they lead hectic lives. Yet they wanted to ensure that they were being absolutely fair to all applicants and were looking at the ideas keeping in view all the parameters defined in the criteria.\n\nSelecting the first handful of grantees out of several hundred would mean disappointment for many and we were fully aware of that. Since we were limited in the number of ideas we could fund, we still wanted to ensure that we kept the process transparent and merit-based. There is already too much trust deficit in this country and there was no way we wanted to add to it.\n\nHence the YouTube videos. Hence the long explanation from Jawwad Farid on the reason for the selection of the first batch. Hopefully the applicants have all gone through some learning during the process.\n\nJawwad also provided free access to pitching and entrepreneurship courses that he has developed from years of experience based on failures and successes that he has personally faced.\n\nThe combined experience of Zafar, Atif and Jawwad \u2013 who are alumni of CalTech, Stanford and Columbia and have started and run companies, have taught, have consulted in various parts of the world, has been invaluable to P@SHA and the Fund. Thanks guys. What would we do without you?\n\nBut take heed \u2013 excited as we all are at the announcement of the first batch of winners, the work has only just begun. We need to work with the grantees, assign mentors to them and ensure that they take the first steps toward helping us \u201cto change the world\u201d.\n\nTo thank Google.org for placing faith in the youth of Pakistan and in P@SHA is a tough task. When I first met the Google team in Islamabad with Badar and we discussed the potential of this country and it\u2019s youth, I had no idea that this would actually amount to anything. But it did and we have never looked back. Thank you Google for your support and thank you for having such a cool, dedicated and committed individual as your Consultant in Pakistan. He is only always a phone call away. Thank you Badar. You rock!\n\nAs for the grantees, what can I say? The Alif Laila video floored us all. Their ability to see how technology can add to the depth and scope of what they have already done, warmed our hearts.\n\nThe audible.com project which would result in the beauty of our language, our poetry and literature being spread to a younger audience, to those who weren\u2019t literate, to those with visual challenges \u2013 and to a much wider audience beyond our borders, excited us all.\n\nThe Online Handmade shoe store idea may not seem like a social idea but if you look at how it will change the lives and add to the incomes of those craftsmen who produce these beautiful products \u00a0\u2013 how it will create jobs and increase market opportunity, you will understand why the judges were sure they were a winner.\n\n\n\n And last but not least Bloodline. With a network of 200,000 volunteers already on their network actively engaged in catering for blood and platelet donations for dengue, cancer and other patients requiring blood, being able to institutionalize and automate the processes will enable them to create a much bigger social impact.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The road to funding Social\u00a0Innovation"},

It\u2019s just what needed to happen in Pakistan. As several of us have been saying over the years, there will never be enough jobs for the number of people that are entering the job market and smart young people should be looking at starting their own ventures and creating job opportunities for their peers. Well it seems it is finally happening.\n\nSome of the entries we have received for the P@SHA Social Innovation Fund show that kids are thinking of solutions to problems using technology but more about that in another post. What\u2019s got me going right now is an activity that is taking place in Lahore October 28-30, 2011. It is called the Lean Startup Machine and is being spearheaded in Pakistan by Umair Moheet Khan, a bright young man who wants to kickstart startups and startup growth in Pakistan.\n\nIn a note that Umair sent to me a couple of days ago, he shared the philosophy of the Lean Startup Machine events:\n\nContrary to popular perception, the phrase \u201clean startup\u201d implies much more than capital efficiency. It encompasses a paradigm-shifting way of thinking about how to build new companies and products, and how to bring those products to market faster. At\u00a0Lean Startup Machine\u00a0we provide participants with a valuable framework of tools, techniques and resources designed to help early-stage companies identify key customers and iterate their products quickly. Startups face incredibly difficult odds, and the vast majority of them will fail. While lean startup methodologies are not a safeguard against failure, they do provide a foundation for real, measurable improvement.\n\nLean Startup Machine Lahore will be a weekend event which will be full of activities that are focused on empowering early startups. It will include team building & ideation workshops, elevator pitches, prototyping, speaker and mentoring sessions (both local and international), leader workshops and a lot more. Trevor Owen, the founder of Lean Startup Machine, is flying in from New York to co-host the event. Trevor is a serial entrepreneur who will no doubt spark off a lot more passion into the local startup community.\n\nMore details about the event are available on the website.\n\nP@SHA is supporting the event fully and I wouldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to be there.

There was also a time when we used to grumble about a few billboards and banners that were a visual nightmare in the city and a total distraction for motorists.\n\nHowever, if you thought all that was worth whining and complaining about, you didn\u2019t know what was round the corner. Check this out! Half a flyover on Shahrah-e-Faisal has been taken over by Vim. Go further down the road and you will see that some other brand has taken over half the flyover as you turn into Karsaz. Go further and one of the underpasses that leads from Gharibabad to Hasan Square announces that a Telenor Talk Shawk connection is what you need. There is nowhere you can turn on any of the main thoroughfares without being bombarded with a commercial message from \u201cyour sponsor\u201d.\n\nIt appears to me that the City Government is selling every bit of public space there is for advertisements, and unlike magazines, there seems to be no editorial control on the balance between advertising and other content.\n\nI remember seeing Walls ice-cream sticks being the visual decoration on Sunset Boulevard for a whole month. It was so irritating driving on that road feeling there had been an invasion by the ice-cream lollies.\n\nThe number of billboards in the city have multiplied any number of times to the extent that the faces of buildings have also been taken over by advertisers. I remember passing Preston University the other day and seeing the front of the building converted into an ad for Ufone \u2026 and so on and so forth.\n\nIs all this really acceptable? Do we the citizens have no say in how public space is utilized? Can multinationals be creative if they have to take over flyovers and underpasses and plaster them with beautiful art with a signature logo in the corner indicating that the beautification is brought to you by Company XYZ. Or do they necessarily have to plaster their advertising messages in our faces?\n\nI feel my eyes get no respite at all as I drive through the city because every bit of space is trying to sell me something \u2013 from billboards, to banners, to overpasses, underpasses, flyovers, poles, roundabouts, buildings. Whether it is an FMCG company, a multinational, a textile company, a bank, a food outlet or a telco, I am at the mercy of each one of them.\n\nSTOP please! I need to breathe.

We are all extremely proud of Umar who has brought glory to Pakistan several times in the past as well.\n\nBy appearing on the TR35 list, he joins an elite group of researchers and technologists. MIT has in previous years recognized the likes of Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page & Sergey Brin of Google and Jonathan Ive, Chief Designer of Apple. Umar is the first Pakistanis to have received this recognition. Check out this link:\n\n http://www.technologyreview.com/tr35/\n\nLUMS today released the announcement making this news public. I am sharing it with you below.\n\nLahore, Pakistan \u2013 August 23, 2011 \u2013 Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) today announced that Dr. Umar Saif, Associate Professor at the School of Science of Engineering, has been recognized by MIT Technology Review as one of the top 35 innovators (TR35) in the world. In the last decade, this is the first time a Pakistani has been selected for the prestigious TR35 award.\n\n\u201cThe TR35 recognizes the world\u2019s top 35 young innovators that are radically transforming technology as we know it. Their work \u2013 spanning medicine, computing, communications, energy, electronics and nanotechnology \u2014 is changing our world\u201d, according to MIT Technology Review.\n\nDr. Umar Saif has been honored for his work on technologies for the developing-world. Technologies developed by Dr. Saif\u2019s research group and startups are used by Millions of people in the developing-world, especially BitMate, that enhances the speed of Internet in the developing-world using peer-to-peer technology, and SMSall.pk, Pakistan\u2019s largest SMS Social Network which has sent close to 4 Billion SMS for users in Pakistan.\n\nDr. Umar Saif joins an elite group of researchers and entrepreneurs selected over the last decade. Previous winners include Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google; Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook; Jonathan Ive, the chief designer at Apple; David Karp, founder of Tumbler; Harvard Professor Al\u00e1n Aspuru-Guzik for his work on Quantum computers; and MIT Neuroscientist Ed Boyden, one of the inventors of the emerging field of optogenetics, which makes it possible to control neurons with light.\n\nMIT Technology Review selects the top innovators after a rigorous evaluation process. The judges, who are leading experts in their fields from universities such as MIT, Stanford and Harvard, consider hundreds of high-impact researchers and entrepreneurs from all over the world, out of which top 35 are chosen for the award.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s group of TR35 recipients is driving the next wave of transformative technology and making an impact on the way we live, work and interact\u201d, said Jason Pontin, editor-in-chief and publisher of the MIT Technology Review.\n\nDr. Saif has won numerous awards for his innovative technology solutions for the developing-world. He was named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum in 2009. He is a recipient of the MIT Technovator Award, Mark Weiser Award, Digital Inclusion Award from Microsoft Research and the IDG Technology Pioneer Award. Before moving to Pakistan, Saif worked at MIT and received a PhD from the University of Cambridge. He is a Fellow of the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust.\n\n\u201cWe are immensely proud of this recognition for Dr. Saif and of how it reflects on the cutting edge work being done at our young School of Science and Engineering,\u201d said Adil Najam, Vice Chancellor of LUMS. \u00a0\u201cDr. Saif\u2019s work demonstrates not only the potential for innovation in technology for development but also the level of enterprise and expertise that already exists within Pakistan and the larger developing world.\u201d", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Dr. Umar Saif named one of the World\u2019s Top Young Innovators by\u00a0MIT"},

Well I hadn\u2019t until I met Khalid Sharif, CEO of Ummah Foods, at the World Islamic Economic Forum in Astana, Kazakhstan and he gave all of us bars of chocolate like this one that I had him pose for here.\n\nKhalid thought of starting this initiative in his own community in East London because he noticed that there were many Muslims who were greatly concerned about whether the ingredients used in chocolates was halal \u2013 the major concern was animal fat.\n\nInitiallly the sales were generated through word of mouth and through personal visits to grocery shops and restaurants but as they came up with more variety they started to develop a distribution network in the UK because of the demand.\n\nKhalid feels that shops like Body Shop and Qibla started off what is termed as \u201cethical positioning\u201d of products. Ummah Chocolates is just trying to position itself as a Muslim brand. He has now found a market in the UK as well s in the Muslim world.\n\n10% of all profits are given to charities and for community projects in the UK. These are not necessarily just projects in Muslim communities but generally in the communities where money is needed for social development.\n\nKhalid is quick to point out that his products are not positioned \u201cagainst\u201d anything that exists in the market today but to meet a demand for halal centric products. He also says that it is important to understand that the second and third generation of Muslims in the UK are consumers who expect producers to come up with tasty products, great packaging, high quality and the convenience of being able to get the product at their neighbourhood stores.

The message she sent was so affectionate, complimentary and yet sincere that I asked her if I could share it on my blog without mentioning her name. She said I could so I am posting it here.\n\nThe Universe doesn\u2019t intend for me to meet you.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll just have to let you know here how I feel about you. I love you \u2013 I think you are incredible and have a beautiful, fun spirit that is SO rare. I have absolutely no agenda in meeting you except to perhaps have a little bit of your awesomeness rub off on me I know if I ever met you I\u2019ll just sit there like an idiot and not know what to say and maybe I should give up any plans of ever meeting you \u2013 but creepy as I may sound I am a HUGE fan. Your strength and energy and inherent goodness inspires me and at the cost of appearing like a complete fool, I\u2019ll say it again \u2026 I LOVE YOU SO MUCH and I keep you in my prayers.\n\nKeep doing the wonderful things that you do \u2013 you give women like me HOPE.\n\nWhat does this message do other than give my ego a boost? Well, I think more than anything it shows us that we have a great responsibility toward the young people that we interact with. Today this young woman thinks I am the bees-knees. Tomorrow a small slip-up from me could shatter her faith in the human race. So it is up to me \u2013 and to all of us who are mentors and leaders in our own space \u2013 to make sure that we don\u2019t say or do anything, nor behave in any way, that could result in young people in our community feeling disillusioned, in young people feeling let down. That is a primary responsibility that we must bear and live up to.\n\nThis young woman is a great example of someone who believes in the goodness of people around her.\u00a0 I would never want her to lose that. I meet a lot of young people in the course of my job. Many of them have great expectations from all of us.

I was just not ready to accept it. I know death is inevitable but somehow whenever someone who is part of your life, leaves this world, it is a hard thing to come to terms with.\n\nAhmed was a stalwart of our industry. He graduated with a BE in Engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology in 1970 and got his MBA from the Institute of Business Administration Karachi. He started his career with United Bank Limited in 1973 and spent over 27 years working in IT in banking. He founded Millennium Software Private Limited in 1997 and had since been a part of the P@SHA community. Ahmed was a former President of the Computer Society of Pakistan and had been a Charter Member of the TiE Karachi Chapter since its inception, having been on the Governing Council at the time of his death. He was actively involved in the formulation of the first IT Policy in 2000.\n\nAhmed was always very much a gentleman \u2013 very soft spoken, gentle and kind, a friend and mentor to many. In meetings we have been a part of over the years, his quiet smile was a norm even when some of us totally lost it and argued passionately about something. I t is not that he didn\u2019t express his views but he always did it quietly and softly without getting overly excited about it. He was often the anchor during some of the more difficult decisions that we made.\n\nI always called him Allaudin Sahab because I felt he was a formal person. It was only in 2004 when I led a delegation to the Nasscom Leadership Conference that I found out that Ahmed had another side to him. He could be naughty, jovial and full of fun \u2013 not quite the distant banker. In the coach that took the delegation around, he cracked jokes and pulled people\u2019s leg and was very much a part of the group. That was when I started to call him Ahmed. In fact I told him during the trip that I had always been in awe of him. He smiled and I could tell that he was amused.\n\nIt is rare in this day and age to know someone who everyone likes and who no-one has anything bad to say about Ahmed Allaudin was such a person. I don\u2019t think I have ever heard anyone say anything nasty about him. That was the quality of the man. He was always helpful, always supportive and a great team player.\n\nAhmed, this world has lost a good soul. May you Rest in Peace. We will all miss you. You have left behind a large number of friends and colleagues who greatly respected you. You will be remembered with great fondness.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "A tribute to Ahmed\u00a0Allaudin"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2011/06/26/gender-diversity-on-company-boards/", "text": "When Afra Sajjad, who is Head of Education & Policy Development at ACCA, asked me if I would agree to be on a panel to discuss \u201cBoard Diversity: is gender the missing link?\u201d I agreed immediately. It was an opportunity for me to voice my very strong views on the need for more women on company boards \u2013 capable, competent, experienced women.\n\nAnd so it was that I ended up at the Avari Hotel on 24th May. There was a very distinguished panel comprising Arif Masud Mirza CEO of ACCA, Shafqat Sultan President of the First Women\u2019s Bank, Asif Malik VP of HR of the Life Sciences Division of ICI Pakistan Ltd, and an even more distinguished group of people as part of the Roundtable comprising amongst others people like Zafar Khan, formerly of Engro and PTCL and Fuad Hashmi of the Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance. The event was very ably choreographed and moderated by Afra Sajjad who is full of enthusiasm and energy.\n\nAfra set the scene by sharing the results of a working paper on \u201cGender diversity on Boards in Pakistan\u201d which was developed by ACCA in partnership with IFC and the Netherland Government.\n\nShe impressed upon participants that the world was facing three kind of crises \u2013 a financial crisis, a climate change crisis and an ecosystem/natural resources crisis. The business model of the past 150 years of take, make and waste where the focus is on maximising shareholder value, is being challenged by all these three crises. Wheat is needed, she said, is a business model that creates ethical sustainable economic, environmental and social value for shareholders but for stakeholders too \u2013an inclusive business model geared towards ensuring sustainable business growth but also positively contributing towards a sustainable world.\n\nIt is the Board that will\u00a0 lead the business model transformation hence the composition of the Board is even more relevant today than it was in the past if we are to conquer these challenges.\n\nWhen looking at world statistics, it was seen that Norway was leading the charge in terms of women on company Boards, followed by Sweden and Finland. The Norwegian Finance Minister actually pushed through legislation in 2006 that mandated all listed companies to have 40% women on Boards by 2008 or face shutdown. In 2011 even those who ardently opposed the legislation, agree that it was the best step that could have been taken for the long term sustainability of businesses. Finland and Sweden, however, had no such legislation. They were able to achieve high diversity because othe women who were already on Boards in those countries were influential and inspiring role models and helped develop organizational culture that was conducive to inducting more women. In the US the Securities & Exchange Commission followed a totally different path. Instead of legislation, they insist on full disclosure by companies on how nominations for directorships are made and if diversity is something that they follow during the nomination process.\n\nIt was interesting to note that Pakistan matched the Scandinavian countries in the percentage of women that they have as directors. Although a large percentage of these companies are family owned and the woman is on the Board because she is a relative of the business owner, there are a percentage of women who are there for other reasons \u2013 because they are competent and have proven their value to the company; because the company thinks that diversity is good for the company; because the women have impressive professional qualifications; because the companies want to follow best practices, etc etc.\n\nThe panel discussion that followed discussed the findings widely and shared their experiences. Although some people felt that there should be a quota for women on Boards, some of us felt that it was not the right way to go. Women don\u2019t want to be given positions because they are women; they want those positions because they deserve them and are competent enough to make a difference. Meritocracy is all they ask for. The problem is that often women are not even considered when Board positions are available. That is something that needs to change.\n\nI shared with participants that IT companies that had women on their Boards had found that their contribution in terms of decision-making, strategy and development of the company, was significant. Of course like other sectors, there just weren\u2019t enough women who were being considered for director positions.\n\nSome of the reasons that are being used for not even looking at women for these positions include:\n\n\u2013 Work-Life Balance issues\n\n \u2013 Lack of business acumen\n\n \u2013 Aggressive & emotional nature of women\n\n \u2013 Not enough experienced & qualified women available\n\nMost participants agreed that the pool of qualified women needed to be increased and that companies needed to start recruiting women in all departments and grooming them for senior middle and senior positions. If women needed to take some time off mid-career, they should be encouraged to rejoin when they are able so that the knowledge and experience they had acquired was not wasted. Flexitime and remote work should be incorporated as much as possible so that job continuity is an option. One suggestion that was made was that positive affirmation should be considered i.e. companies should specifically inform recruitment agencies to include a percentage of women in the candidates that they shortlist for companies to look at. The women should be hired if they are qualified for the advertised positions.\n\nTraining for directors \u2013 both men and women \u2013 is something that is sorely needed, to ensure that they have all the current know-how and the capacity to strategize and drive company growth.\n\nThe overall discussion was both interesting and productive with challenges being pointed out but solutions being offered. It was certainly one of the better discourses that I have been a part of. Thank you Afra.

But how many times do we talk about something nice that has happened to us, something that someone did to help us and renew our faith in the people who are part of our community and our world? This is the second time this month that I have had cause to be thankful and so I thought I would blog about this experience just as I did about my encounter with the honest taxi driver.\n\nYesterday as I was leaving the Avari Hotel in Karachi after a very interesting seminar on diversity, I was feeling happy because we had had a good debate and I had met some nice and interesting people, discussed some new ideas and had some coffee. The good mood turned to frustration very quickly as I drove onto Fatima Jinnah Road. My car just halted and wouldn\u2019t start again. It was as if it\u2019s heart had stopped beating. I tried to figure out what had happened as the honks of impatient drivers filled my ears. But no luck.\n\nJust as I was considering calling someone for help, a young man knocked on my window, introduced himself as a mechanic and asked if he could help. I must admit to being nervous about opening the car door but I had little choice. So as he got off his motorbike and got into the car, I braved myself. Would he take out a knife or a gun and ask me for my wallet and phone? Such are the times we live in that even when someone is trying to help us, we view him with suspicion. Thank God none of my fears came to pass.\n\nHe put the car in neutral, got back on his motorbike and with his foot pushed my car to the side of the road so that he could have a look under the hood to find out what was wrong. He discovered there was a fuse and a couple of the cut-outs were burnt. Fortunately for me, Azhar (that was his name) worked for Toyota and had some extra cut-outs in his tool bag. Within 5 \u2013 10 minutes he had fixed the problem and the car had come back to life.\n\nI asked him what I owed him. He told me the price of the cut-outs and I gave him something extra for his time and his thoughtfulness. He replied that I was like one of his sisters and he had stopped because he could not bear the thought of seeing me stranded in the middle of the road. I felt like a damsel in distress who had been saved from an unpleasant fate. I drove off smiling and feeling blessed that there were still nice people in the world and I had just met one of them. :) Thank you Azhar. May God bless you.\n\nEntry filed under: Posts.

And they live in different counties across the globe.\n\nPakistan is no exception \u2013 of the 180 million people in this country, the majority are hardworking, dedicated and compassionate human beings who are trying to make an honest buck and live a decent and happy existence. In the dismal conditions that have prevailed this past week, thankfully today I was once again reminded that I live amongst some really amazing people.\n\nI arrived in Islamabad this morning at 9 and after checking into the Guest House, I decided that instead of renting a car for the day (unnecessarily wasting company funds), I would hail a yellow cab and make my way to the Evacuee Trust Complex where several meetings were being\u00a0 held back-to-back. It was only when i was in distant sight of the Marriott Hotel that I was told by the security guys there that yellow cabs were not allowed beyond that point. I had no option but to get my laptop, iPad and other paraphernalia and walk the remainder of the way. The sun was scorching hot but I braved it and had almost reached the Software Technology Park (which is next to the Marriott) when I realized that I didn\u2019t have my wallet in my pocket.\n\nI backtracked an d frantically looked for the yellow cab \u2013 saw many of them but not my chappie. Dejected I gave up and headed back for the Tech Park, phoning my office on the way and asking Mustafa to call the Guest House to find out if they had noted down the license plate number of the yellow cab when I left there earlier that morning.\u00a0 I knew I had little hope of getting the wallet back but kept whispering a small prayer hoping that God would hear me.\n\nI had Rs. 28,000 in the wallet (had to pay someone here), two credit cards (VISA and AMEX), my NIC Card, my Health Card, my Frequent Flyer Mile cards and heaven knows what else. My life was going to be hell trying to replace some of the cards. Sigh!\n\nAs I was drowning my sorrow in a glass of ice cold water, the lady from the Guest House called and told me that the cabbie had gone back to the Guest House and turned in my wallet at the reception desk. He had first gone back to where he had dropped me but by then i had given up and left and he did not know which office I was going to in the Technology Park. However, he did know where I was\u00a0 staying. For me Rs. 28,000 is a lot of money; for a struggling cab driver it is a whole lot more. And yet he went out of this way to drive back to the guest house and return what didn\u2019t rightfully belong to him. There is hope for us yet. :-) I hope one day I will run into the cab driver again if only to thank him for renewing my faith in the goodness of people and the integrity that is in-built in many of us.\n\nDisclaimer: this is not a picture of \u201cmy cabbie\u201d \u2013 just a placeholder until i find the real McCoy.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Hey world meet a true-blue\u00a0Pakistani!"},

I guess the two trips I had already had to take in the previous weeks and my father\u2019s health had exhausted me completely \u2013 and I just wanted to get back into a routine that allowed me to switch off for a while each day. But the two events were important and I couldn\u2019t justify not attending (yes I know this is a double negative but so what? ;))? One was a regional interaction on Cyber Crime legislation and the other was an Execuutive Committee meeting of the Asia Pacific ICT Alliance. So I decided to make the trip.\n\nAt Karachi airport I wondered yet again whether I had made the right decision. As I went in through the Fast Track section and my bags cleared security, I headed for the Check In counter but was stopped by an FIA/Civil Aviation guy who asked where I was going. I told him I was headed for Sri Lanka. He asked why I was going there. I was losing patience but I answered in the most civil tone possible. He then flipped through my passport and kept looking at me with what can only be termed as an intimidating look. This continued for a few minutes until I was forced to ask him if there was a problem. He stayed quiet and just peered at me again.\n\nThe ordeal wasn\u2019t over yet. He then asked me to place my suitcase on the counter and proceeded to have it checked. Each item was checked out meticulously and the suitcase was checked out for a false bottom. By this team I was feeling a mixture of emotions \u2013 anger, fear, uncertainty. I asked the guy again what the problem was. He again said nothing. I told him that I traveled frequently and had never been put through such a process. Were they looking for something in particular? Did they have some sort of intelligence that they should perhaps share with me? Should I even travel? That is how nervous I had become.\n\nHe looked at me one more time with that same intimidating gaze and then told me to move on without answering any of my concerns. I was feeling pretty shaken by that time but proceeded to check in, past immigration and into the lounge and was soon on my way to Colombo. It was the first time that I was unable to sleep on the flight.\n\nWhen I got my luggage in Colombo, I found that my new combination luck which my brother had brought for me from London was missing. Someone had obviously removed it. God knows why. There was nothing missing. This had got curiouser and curiouser \u2013 and it had made me feel that my personal space had been \u201cinvaded\u201d and I had been unnecessarily \u201cterrorized\u201d. Is all this action against the average citizen justified under the guise of security?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Intimidation on home\u00a0soil!"},

We had been told that Sri Lanka was one of the countries that still offered \u201cVisa on Arrival\u201d to citizens from Pakistan. Usually a Visa on Arrival process brings to mind long queues, a visa fee, copies of passport etc etc so I must admit that tired as I was, I was not looking forward to having to go through it.\n\nSo you can imagine how pleasantly surprised I was when I landed and was asked to proceed direct to the immigration counter. There I was greeted with a smile and a \u201cgood evening\u201d. The official asked me why I was visiting and how long I would be staying. When I told him I would be there 5 days he said \u201cvery brief trip\u201d and then proceeded to give me a 30 day visa \u2013 and that was it, in 30 seconds flat!\n\nThen I proceeded to get my baggage and as I passed Customs, the customs official asked where I had come from and how long I was going to be there. Again there was a smile of welcome. I told him i would be there for 5 days and he said I should stay longer and enjoy the country, the food, the lovely lakes and the culture. I told him I wish I could but I had to get back to work. He nodded and asked me to enjoy my visit.\n\nNow that is what I call a warm reception. It was absolutely unexpected (especially when traveling on a green passport) and made me want to visit Sri Lanka again. Serendib indeed!! Well done Sri Lanka! I love you.\n\nI have been to Sri Lanka before \u2013 many years ago but in the current paraoid-heavy atmosphere, it is a pleasure traveling to a country that does not presume you \u201cguilty\u201d or labels you as a terrorist because you are from a particular country or region or you profess a certain faith.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "I love Sri\u00a0Lanka!"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/are-people-really-apathetic/", "text": "As I listened to Dave Meslin speak, it all began to make sense. It really is so simple. In this video he asks one question:Is the society really apathetic or is it the environment, the culture, the conditions around us that need to change so that people \u2013 lots of them \u2013 who care, are able to contribute toward making this a better world for us all?\n\nSo let us look at what Dave says. He asks if we really think our neighbours, our friends, our colleagues and people around us are selfish, stupid and don\u2019t care at all about anyone but themselves? If that is true, then there really is no hope. However, he goes on to say that he doesn\u2019t believe this to be a fact and then goes on to identify 7 barriers that keep us from taking part in our communities, even when we really and truly do care.\n\nThe first one he identifies is City Hall \u2013 i.e. the government. If you look at the ads and the notices that are put out by government anywhere in the world, the message they convey is that they do not want you involved in the planning process \u2013 something that Dave terms as \u201cIntentional exclusion\u201d! He says that if the private sector put out ads like that, they would never sell anything.\n\nThe second obstacle he highlights is Public Space. If you look at all the billboards, banners and signboards that fill our streets, it indicates to you that the people with the most money have the loudest voices, says Dave. There is a price tag on Freedom of Expression. So aptly put!\n\nThen there is the Media \u2013 our friend and our foe. The sensational stance taken by most media means coverage of celebrities, politicians and scandals. Even when they cover politics, they make it sound like a spectator sport hence discouraging the average person from wanting to be involved.\n\nDave mentions Heroes as the fourth obstacle. One would never have thought that heroes would be seen as an obstacle but listen to what he says. Heroes are projected as people who are chosen, who are special, who were meant to save the world. No-one talks about heroism being a collective effort, no-one tells you it isn\u2019t glamourous, that it is voluntary, that it involves sacrifice but can lead to change and a feeling of absolute satisfaction \u2013 that we don\u2019t have to wait for a Superman, Wonder Woman, Harry Potter type of person to bring about change and achieve great things.\n\nHow could Political Parties be left out of the mix. Dave says, and we all know this to be true, that most policiticians say the same things, have their own personal agendas, blame each other for any problems that exist, and don\u2019t present any bold or creative options as solutions thus leading to cynicism amongst the electorate.\n\nDave Meslin says that all these obstacles are just that \u2013 obstacles and we can overcome them by simply redefining apathy. Apathy is not an internal syndrome he says but a complex web of cultural barriers that lead to disengagement. Once we see this, it is easy enough to dismantle the barriers and embark on the road ahead.\n\nThank you Dave Meslin and TED for bringing forth this brilliant video \u2013 it was indeed an Idea worth Sharing.\n\nDo watch the video. I don\u2019t do it enough justice.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/little-consideration-given-to-the-importance-of-privacy-of-individuals/", "text": "Collection of data by various organizations, government bodies & individuals has become such an integral part of our lives that, more often than not, we don\u2019t even think before sharing our most personal data with complete strangers.\n\nSeveral things happened to me last week that have resulted in my need to write this post.\n\nFirst incident: I went to Metro in Karachi to buy my monthly groceries and as I got out of my car, a young man approached me with a clipboard and asked if I would be interested in buying some engine oil from Caltex. It was a really good deal, he informed me. As usual, I was in a mad rush so I told him that I didn\u2019t have the time to come and have a look at the product and its advantages at that time but would probably check it out later. He responded \u201cThat\u2019s fine Ma\u2019am. May I have your name, your email address and your cell number.\u201d I answered \u201cNo you may not. That is private information I do not wish to share with someone i don\u2019t know.\u201d He was persistent and told me that he needed the information so that he could send me details on all the wonderful deals his organization was offering. Being a privacy advocate, I tried to explain to him the dangers of parting with such information but like most surveyors, and sales people, he had only one focus \u2013 adding more names and contacts to his company\u2019s existing marketing database. I gave up trying to convert him to my way of thinking because I had limited time. However the irritation stayed with me.\n\nSecond incident: It seems everyone was out to irritate me that day. As I parted with thousands of rupees and was wondering how the average Pakistani managed to live and provide food for his/her family, I was approached by yet another young man with a clipboard. He said to me that I was lucky to have come to the supermarket that day because all customers shopping on that day qualified for a lucky draw. All I had to do was part with my name, home address, email address and cell number. I didn\u2019t see the point of arguing with him because he was only doing what he was hired to do. So I just said that I did not wish to part with my personal data. He persisted but I told him that I was not likely to change my mind, turned my back on him and left.\n\nThird incident: The next day I got a call from a representative of the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (PTCL) who started the conversation by asking me how I was doing and if I had a few minutes. I asked what it was about and he started to tell me about this new broadband deal that his organization was offering. I interrupted him by asking where he had got my cell number from, that i didn\u2019t recall sharing it with his organization or giving my permission for them to share it with their marketing reps. I also told him that I did not appreciate receiving a sales call on my mobile phone, that I only used it for business and personal purposes.\n\nInstead of being apologetic, the young man proceeded to tell me that he was calling from PTCL and that he had access to all my information. He then rattled off my home address which, as you can imagine, resulted in me losing my cool totally. I told him that I took great exception to the fact that anyone had access to my personal data. To this he replied that I was obviously not aware that such practices were normal in Western and civilized societies and that it was due to the existence of such databases that people were able to avail of all sorts of schemes and benefits. I tried to explain to him that it was wrong for organizations to have access to anyone\u2019s personal data & for them to use it indiscriminately. However, he didn\u2019t see it that way and thought I was being very unreasonable at not accepting an internationally accepted best practice.\n\nFourth incident: A young female friend I am very fond of was looking very disturbed last week. When I asked her what was wrong, she explained to me that she had a medical problem for which she had consulted a specialist. Present in the consultation room, in addition to the specialist, were several other young medics. They stood around poking at various parts of her and discussing her \u201cproblems\u201d as if she was a species that they had procured for experimentation and study. The reason for this was that this was one of the major teaching hospitals in the city. I remembered that when my dad had been hospitalized a few weeks earlier, he had also been put through similar group examinations. He had looked uncomfortable throughout the process \u2013 the indignity of the entire experience had left him feeling depressed and humiliated. My young friend expressed the same sentiments and asked why her medical problems couldn\u2019t be a private matter between her and her doctor.\n\nAll these incidents indicate that professionals and organization give little consideration and thought to the privacy of those who are paying them for a service or a consultation. They believe it is their right to do whatever they wish with data they have collected, share it with whoever they like and use it in any which way. They think it is unreasonable of us to expect them to respect our privacy. We are made to feel uncooperative and unreasonable if we object and insist on our privacy being a key element of our relationship with them. Why is this? And should we not stand up and resist this increasing trend? I think we should. It makes me angry that organizations continue to violate my privacy and that I continue to allow them to. I think if we continue to let this to happen, we leave ourselves open to continued abuse of our basic right to protect our private information.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Little consideration given to the importance of Privacy of\u00a0individuals"},

What does \u201cnot forwarding violence\u201d mean? Why would I condone violence, let alone spread it? But as I read this message on the Take Back the Tech website, it began to sink in\n\nHow many times have you received a forwarded message that contains photographs or a video of someone being violated or humiliated? What do you do with it? Many of us do not stop and think about the potential long-term impact of our action when we record, share and pass on information using .\u00a0 In each act of viewing and forwarding, we continue and replicate the violence.\u00a0 With this pledge, we encourage you to stop and think. You have the power to stop the spread. Take a stand. Don\u2019t forward. I am firmly against violence against women. I will NOT forward any form of message, video or photograph of someone being violated or humiliated. I will NOT forward any form of message, video or photograph that violates another person\u2019s right to privacy.\n\nIsn\u2019t it strange how many of us naively spread the message and visuals of violence without realizing it? In fact we probably think we are advocating against violence by sharing these visuals. With the currently available communication tools which are so easy to use and with the emergence of Social Media, it is as easy as pressing a key. We click without thinking, we forward without realizing the harm we are causing, we share everything from photos to videos to comments to real names and locations without an inkling of what we are doing, without considering that by doing so we are in fact perpetrating the act of violence to a much broader degree, thus harming the very people we want to help.\n\nSo from now on let us think before we forward anything.

It features all 14 official teams along with official players, stadiums and kits, and is played directly in the browser. The game is powered by a superior cricket engine at its core, coupled with a pick-up-and-play interface to appeal to casual and core gamers alike.\n\nThis is the second time the company has made waves in the Pakistani gaming industry. Many of you will remember that their previous hit title \u2018Cricket Revolution\u2019 which won the P@SHA ICT Awards in 2009 and went on to win the Silver at APICTA in Melbourne. Mindstorm Studios has raised the bar in Pakistan\u2019s game development industry with the launch of Cricket Power.\n\nThe game is being published by Karkadann Games, an Abu Dhabi Media Company subsidiary, and is currently available at www.cricketpower.com.\n\nSo what is the big deal, you might ask? The big deal is that Mindstorm Studios is a young startup company from Pakistan. All the software professionals, coders, designers and the management are Pakistanis. It has received no outside funding. The team is self-taught. It has managed to cross all hurdles, conquer all challenges and emerge as a champion. Image has not stopped Mindstorm Studios from achieving their potential, from reaching their goal. It should give other young people in Pakistan hope and confidence that all one needs to do to succeed is have a dream and a plan, and to do whatever one can to execute the plan professionally and not let perceived and real challenges stand in the way.\n\nI for one take great pride in the achievements of this amazing company and I look forward to watching their growth and the continued i nnovation that I am sure will emerge from their studios.

That\u2019s why everywhere you look, you find there is a great demand for skilled staff who understand how to develop a User Interface for mobile applications, provide a great User experience and be able to develop for all sorts of mobile platforms \u2013 whether they be mobile phones or tablets.\n\nCompanies are setting up in-house training facilities and are spending many hours trying to bring their teams up to speed on the latest technologies.\u00a0 Some universities are beginning to provide additional courses on Mobile Application development to serve the needs of the industry and to make their graduates more employable.\n\nThat is why we were delighted when Rabia Azfar of Nokia Pakistan told us that Nokia was planning a Developers Workshop which would include:\n\n Introduction to J2ME and the tools, Mobile Java Standards, Nokia enhancements beyond the standard, Building GUIs with native components, painting one\u2019s own GUI, Memory management and performance, Java on Series 40 platoforms, Designing for touch and Qt for mobile development amongst other things.\n\nNormally the 4 day training would have cost each developer in the regio n of US$500 but Nokia made this training available for free to around 50 developers in Karachi from January 31 \u2013 February 3.\n\nI was there for the Inaugural session and then again for the closing session. It was good to see so many young developers stay through the 4 days of training. Usually there are dropouts on the 2nd or 3rd day but the training must have been intense and valuable because there was 100% attendance. At the closing session I had the chance to speak with Teemu Kiiiarvi, Developer Relations Manager, Middle East and Africa at Nokia South Africa in some detail. Teemu was of the opinion that the developer s in Pakistan were much more talented and keen to learn and absorb new ideas and skills than in many other countries in the region. He said it had been a pleasure for him and his colleagues from\u00a0 Nokia to work with the developers and to provide hands-on training. Teemu and Rabia both expected that in the weeks and months ahead, these young people and their companies would be coming up with innovative new applications for the Nokia platform that would certainly find its way onto the Nokia Ovi online applications store.\n\nI think they were not being overly optimistic because as I chatted with the young developers, some of them shared ideas for apps that they had already started working on. They were excited about the new skills they had learnt and were keen to implement them.\n\nWe need many more such workshops to happen across the country so that our developers will continue to be at the cutting edge of development. Nokia has already promised to hold a developer\u2019s training workshop in Lahore in April and then subsequently in Islamabad. But, as Rabia Azfar pointed out \u201cWe will only hold them if we have at least 60 registrations in each of the cities. Piece of cake Rabia \u2013 piece of cake! There are many more developers who are dying to attend hands-on training conducted by international experienced trainers. Bring it on and we will register the applicants. P@SHA was proud to be a partner in bringing this workshop to Karachi. We will continue to work with Nokia on subsequent workshops and other exciting initiatives.

Today I decided that I would stop looking for the misplaced card and apply for a new one.\n\nSo this morning off I went to my friendly neighbourhood NADRA office. The first thing I noticed was that Friday is Ladies Day at NADRA so only ladies can apply for ID cards on this day of the week. :) I wondered if that meant that ladies were discouraged from applying for new ID cards on any other day of the week. Nonetheless I was there for a purpose so I went and queued up.\n\nThe girl at the counter asked me if i wanted the card issued urgently or did it not matter when I got it. I asked how long it would take in the normal course. She responded, \u201cMaybe a month or maybe two.\u201d So of course I said I needed it urgently which still meant waiting 10 \u2013 12 days. She then asked if I would like to be on the Fast Track. I said sure and was immediately whisked away to a room where the process began immediately. Of course this meant I had to fork out Rs. 1,000. Not knowing how much it cost otherwise, I thought to myself: I have to get to the office. It is probably worth my time to just get this done quickly.\n\nIt was only much later that I found out how much time I had really saved.\n\nApparently, the normal process if you lose your card is:\n\n 1. File an FIR (First Investigation Report)\n\n 2. Wait 8-10 days in case it turns up\n\n 3. Pay Rs. 150\n\n 4. Get your form attested by the District Nazim ( if you can find him)\n\n 5. Then come back to complete the process\n\n 6. If you are married you need to have an attested copy of your Nikahnama (marriage certificate)\n\nNow listen to what the process is if you are on the Fast Track:\n\n 1. Pay Rs. 1000 and get a token\n\n 2. No FIR\n\n 3. No waiting period\n\n 4. No attestation by District Nazim\n\n 5. Just proceed with the process\n\nSee what a difference there is in the process so you actually save a lot of time.\n\nAs if this was not irritating enough, the process itself has changed since I first had my ID card made. This time they made me take off my spectacles, and instead of\u00a0 needing one thumb print, they had to scan both thumbs and all 8 fingers. I told the guy \u201cSo you are assuming that we are all criminals and are taking no chances?\u201d He smiled and said \u201cMa\u2019am I am just doing my job\u201d (couldn\u2019t fault him for that).\n\nThen I went to the next computer where I was asked for a copy of the ID card I had lost. The lady also asked if I was married or single. I said I was single. She asked if my parents were alive. I told her Ammi was deceased by that my father was in the land of the living. She asked for Ammi\u2019s name and asked for a copy of my father\u2019s ID. Now why should she need that? Fortunately, I had a copy because I needed it to apply for a Police Clearance Certificate for a visa (but that\u2019s another story).\n\nAnyway, after this the document was printed. I had to go to another lady to sign it and was then told to come back in 10 \u2013 12 days. And that was that!\n\nWhat occured to me as I got into the car was that it was a warped process at best and the fact that the rules were different if you had money, was really pathetic. Why should you need the Nazim to attest the information you have provided? But if for some Godforsaken needed, there was some rationale to it, then paying Rs. 850 more should not mean that you didn\u2019t have to. If an FIR was required, then the fast track could mean that a policeman was available on site for you to lodge it there. It should not mean that you didn\u2019t have to lodge an FIR. Different procedures for different people I guess. No wonder people feel that some are more equal in this country than others.\n\nAnother thing to note is that each time there is a change in your status \u2013 i.e. should you marry or get a divorce, should one of your parents be deceased, should you start your own business instead of being an employee, and in several other cases, you will need to go to a NADRA office to have the alternation made to your ID. Big brother must know what you are up to at all times. Talk about privacy! Sheesh!", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Different procedures for different\u00a0people"},

Arose my curiosity enough to go listen to this talk by Johanna Blakely which i thought was very interesting. Decided to share it here in case some of you may have missed it.\n\nIn this TED Talk presented at the December 2010 TEDWomen conference, Johanna Blakely talks about how social media could alter the assumptions held about gender. Blakely\u2019s background in studying the impacts of mass media and entertainment on our society gives her interesting insight into the way virtual socializing has affected the old-school demographics used by marketers.\n\nI had not realized that women were spending so much time on social media and were such heavy users of the space. I suspected it may be true but the figures that Johanna presents are overwhelming. Does it mean we will take over the media space, she asks. Clearly we are not but she believes that more and more media organizations will want to have women on their teams because of their expertise and knowledge of social media, that it is in fact going to change the way women are perceived. Stereotyping of women by media and advertisers will become more difficult, she says because the social media is populated by women of all ages who refuse to be a demographic, who are all very different and whose voices and preferences are now being heard.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Johanna Blakely talks about Social Media & the end of\u00a0gender"},

Ltd. The Pakistan Fast Growth 25 companies have grown an average of 81% a year for the past three years.\u00a0 They paint Pakistan in a new light, suggesting that Pakistan is a strong country for entrepreneurship, said the Press Release.\n\nWhat is even more interesting to note is that as a group, the Pakistan 25 broke AllWorld records for high growth of 8 countries in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. \u00a0The companies who made the Pakistan 25 posted a 81% annual growth rate between 2007 and 2009 with an average size of 400 employees per company, and since inception they have created 12,000 jobs. \u00a0On average the entrepreneurs are 41 years old, with a number having founded other successful companies.\u00a0 Leading the Pakistan 25 growth rankings are companies in High-Tech and Telecommunications, and Agriculture and Textiles. \u00a0Many of these rising Pakistan 25 companies are not just serving local markets, but are competing globally.\n\nMalik Ahmad Jalal, AllWorld\u2019s Director of the Pakistan 25 said in a statement that \u201cPakistani entrepreneurs have flourished in spite of some of the most restricting economic and security environments in the world. These dynamic men and women are a great resource and the best bet for Pakistan\u2019s future.\u00a0 US Ambassador Cameron Munter will host the Awards Celebration for the winners at his residence on 24 January 2011 which will also be graced by\u00a0 Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh and other VIPs.\n\nAround 100 companies competed for a spot on the Pakistan 25.\u00a0 Only the fastest growing private companies make the list, and each company is credentialed by AllWorld based on strenuous international standards.\u00a0 Of the 30 companies that made the Pakistan 25, Lahore had the most number with 12 winners and Karachi came in a close second with 10 winners.\n\nInteresting to note is that amongst the top 25, the top 10 were IT companies. So who says that the IT sector is not growing and not contributing to job creation. These companies have proven all nay-sayers wrong. Well done guys! We are extremely proud of you.\n\nJamal Khan, CEO of Arpatech that ranked third on this list says that his strategy was to develop a small number of anchor relationships and grow with those firms. I am an optimist, he said, about Pakistan\u2019s potential and its people. Pakistan is a compelling market with a tremendous resource pool of talented engineers and entrepreneurs. Arpatech develops innovative solutions for complex problems, and they do this by aligning themselves closely with their clients.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Focusing on deep relationships with a select number of customers is often counter-intuitive to a fast-growth business model, but this was key to gaining and international clie nts post 9-11 and sustaining those relationships in spite of turbulence in Pakistan. Arpatech looks to grow by focusing on incubating ideas and taking those to market. They are also looking at setting up a second office in Malaysia or the Middle East.\n\nAt Number 5 is TradeKey.com which is the world\u2019s fastest growing online trading platform. It connects over 4.9 million importers, exporters and traders in more than 240 countries including USA, UK, China, Germany, France, India, Pakistan and the Middle East. Aiming to make \u201cdoing business easier\u201d, TradeKey.com was founded in 2005 and within a short span of just over 4 years it is now ranked among the top 5 online B2B marketplaces of the world. Junaid Mansoor, the CEO of TradeKey says that his vision for the next 5 years is to make TradeKey a name that would be trustworthy and well known to Worldwide SMEs and will become a core part of their business process. TradeKey will reach out to 20,000 different cities of the World by forming partnerships with local entrepreneurs, and provide a kick-start environment to nurture entrepreneurship.\n\nAt Number 6 is Sofizar, a B2C Internet Marketing company with development and operations based out of Lahore, PK. Sofizar is aggressively pursuing a very rapid growth path with its experienced management, excellent team and a great track record since its inception in April, 2004. While Sofizar has worked with premier clients like government agencies and large multinationals, for exporting its technologies, their focus has been marketing directly to consumers. After clocking high growth rates over the past 3 years, Sofizar has annual sales of over $20 Million in 2009 through its Live Events Vertical Search Engine as well as its Events Tickets Business. Sofizar continues to be profitable by maintaining healthy margins as well as by rapidly growing its top line revenues.\n\nZafar Khan, CEO of Sofizar, says that his vision is that Sofizar will be the global leader in Search Engine based E-commerce and Lead Generation and they intend to be Pakistan\u2019s first internet marketing billion dollar capitalization company.

The CEO is a young man by the name of Mohsin Afzal based in Islamabad. Mohsin is a Fulbright Scholar and a recent MBA graduate from UC Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business. During his MBA, he interned with LucasArts in Product Marketing and prior to that worked with Trango Interactive for 4 years. The Simpsons, Sienfeld, Douglas Adams and Arsenal FC are some of his favourite tv shows.\n\nOver a 100 days after the devastating floods in Pakistan Mohsin and his team were extremely concerned that there were\u00a0 still mi llions of men, women and children in dire need of help. In order to prevent the more than 21 million lives destroyed by the flood from becoming a distant memory, we.R.play decided it would try to raise awareness and funds for those affected through an iPhone and Facebook app available now online and in the Apple App store. All of the revenue earned by we.R.play through Relief Copter will be donated for the rehabilitation of the Pakistan flood victims.\n\nRelief Copter is available on the Apple app store (http://itunes.apple.com/app/relief- copter/id404158691?mt=8) and on Facebook (apps.facebook.com/relief_copter).\n\nMohsin tells me that Relief Copter took them around 3 months to complete (both the iPhone and the facebook version). The development period would have been shorter if this hadn\u2019t been their first title. we.R.play partnered with\u00a0Bangladeshi\u00a0based G4R in the development of these applications. What is really interesting to note is that the main developer for the Facebook version is only 17 years old and in 2nd year of College. The process was slowed down when he had his monthly tests\n\nThe app, \u2018Relief Copter,\u2019 is a simple game in which users pilot an aid copter in order to drop relief crates accurately in order to progress. The app features 8 beautifully crafted levels depicting the landscapes of Pakistan. More importantly, it also features important facts and photos about the impact of the flood, and the Facebook version gives players the ability to share this information and donate to the flood relief effort.\n\n\u201cThrough this application we wanted to play a small part in helping the people who lost everything when the floods hit,\u201d said Kamil Waheed, the 17-year old developer with we.R.play, \u201cWe hope to remind the world that the flood waters might have receded, but there is still a lot of work to be done to put the millions of lives affected back on track.\u201d The flood affectees have drifted to the periphery of the worlds conscience. Relief Copter is just a small effort to remind people (particularly outside pakistan) that there is still a lot of work to be done and a lot of help still needed.\n\nKudos to Mohsin, Kamil and the team at we.R.play for having thought of yet another unique way to help in disaster relief.

The media internationally has not adequately focused on the extent of the devastation. I will not get into the whys and whereofs. Nor will I indulge in any conspiracy theories. Perhaps it is just disaster fatigue.\n\nThere are several ways to approach a situation like this. Either you whine and complain about how the world has let us down, have drawing room conversations about what the government or someone else hasn\u2019t done, or you just jump in and find some way to help. Fortunately many people did just that. From NGOs, student groups, doctors, professionals and individuals to large national and multinational organizations, many picked themselves up and either donated, raised funds or actually went into the affected areas with food, medicine and shelter.\n\nEnter Rahim Lalani! Rahim decided that outreach was the core problem \u2013 that there had to be a \u201cdifferent\u201d way of getting the message out. \u201cWe felt that we needed to bring the world\u2019s attention and care to the Flood victims; to appeal to people from all over the world; to move them and inspire them to action\u201d, said Rahim. And what better way to do that than to have an appeal made by someone they know and love? This is how the idea for Superstars for Flood Relief was born.\n\nRahim and his team at TRG Tech turned to Superstars \u2013 Superstars who could dedicate musical hits and share inspirational messages in the name of the Floods, Superstars who people considered their own, appealing to them in a voice that they recognised, evoking emotion for the plight of the affectees.\n\n\u201cWhile one disaster has already occurred, we are trying to prevent a second disaster of suffering, chronic diseases, malnutrition and poverty\u201d says Rahim.\n\nAmong the Superstars who have committed to the cause so far are the legendary Abida Parveen, Haroon, Hadiqa Kiyani and the Aunty Disco Project.

I asked him why he wanted just the women. There were a lot of men there too. He said \u201cbecause this is a woman\u2019s issue.\u201d How is violence a women\u2019s issue? How is crime a women\u2019s issue? How is a protest against irresponsible reporting a women\u2019s issue? How is totally senseless statements that are aimed at the survivor as opposed to the perpetrator a women\u2019s issue? How is revealing the name, car registration number and other details of the survivor a women\u2019s issue?\n\nWhen will people begin to understand that any issue that affects any citizen of this country, actually affects us all and all of us need to raise our voice against injustice, against violence, against corruption, against inadequate health and social services, against insufficient funds spent on education, against unethical and irresponsible behaviour. If we don\u2019t, then we have only ourselves to blame.\n\nWith the increased number of media channels, magazines, newspapers, FM stations and social media networks out there, it is extremely important that we become more responsible in whatever we say and write. I am not suggesting unnecessary legislation or censorship. However, we need to understand that with Freedom of expression comes great responsibility. We must ensure that whatever we say is accurate, is corroborated, does not infringe on someone\u2019s privacy and is not insensitive or unethical or likely to cause harm. We also need to do some research on the subject we decide to write or talk about.\n\nMany of the tv channels had only sent cameramen to the protest and even those reporters who were there, were unaware of the issues so how could they possibly create a credible report. A few of the Print media had sent people who asked some sensible questions. However, I was very disappointed to see that when WAR\u2019s (War Against Rape) Khadija started to talk about all the pending cases that needed attention, no-one from the press actually listened. It was very sad.\n\nWe look to the media to be watchdogs, to report the news responsibly, ethically and intelligently so that there is accountability. But with Breaking News being the order of the day, who checks facts, who bothers to be sensitive to the victims needs, who cares if the survivor\u2019s privacy is protected. Sensationalism and sound bytes is what it\u2019s all about.\n\nThis was the first time that the \u201cTake Back the Tech\u201d team participated in a street protest. We were proud to be there with our placards asking for an end to violence. Other protesters were curious but happy to see us there. They asked us what the Take Back the Tech campaign was all about and, once they knew, many of them held up the extra placards we had taken with us. If nothing else, we were able to create an awareness, speak up against injustice and show our support for the cause. I was also happy to see some colleagues from Microsoft at the protest. It was actually quite a diverse group. Amongst them were artists, writers, finance people, housewives, teachers, business executives, NGO representatives, students and activists.\n\nMaybe people are finally realizing that it is time to wake up. We are citizens of this country and if we want things to change, we need to speak up for ourselves and for others. Let\u2019s break the silence now. Let us hold people accountable. Let\u2019s join hands and offer solutions, not just criticism.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Let us break the\u00a0silence!"},

Finally, we decided enough was enough. It was important to fix a date and launch this event with whoever was available.\n\nSo the event was set for 5th December at T2F. It was a Sunday so we weren\u2019t really sure how many people would turn up. The idea was a simple one. There was a need for tech startups and people with ideas for starting tech companies or creating tech solutions, to be able to meet on a regular basis, network, share ideas, successes and failures and learn from each other.\n\nAnd so it was. The day dawned and at 4 pm people started to roll in. In all 40+ people showed up. Quite a substantial number! There was a bit of huddling and networking before proceedings began. Everyone introduced themselves, talked about what they were doing or wanted to do, why they were there.\n\nThere was a workshop type session whereby people were broken up into groups of 3, each group comprising of 3 individuals who hadn\u2019t previously met. They were given some time to come up with an idea for a new startup and then each group presented their idea. Some interesting ideas came up \u2013 nothing earth-shattering of course given the short amount of time allocated. However, it got people thinking, sharing, getting to know each other, strategizing. Great activity. I am so sorry I wasn\u2019t able to make it but I will certainly be there next time.\n\nStartup Sunday will be held every month in Karachi. Have spoken to friends in Lahore and Islamabad to work with us on organizing a similar activity in those cities. Naturally the format will change each time and new things will be added to so that the meeting continues to provide value to participants.

They are also part of an award-winning team that has concentrated on one area of expertise in software \u2013 Quality Assurance!\n\nRecently we were thrilled when their product \u201cKualitee\u201d was featured on VentureBeat. They announced that they were launching the world\u2019s first iPhone-compatible quality-assurance testing platform. The Kualitee app, according to the company, is aimed at giving mobility to technicians and engineers who have to constantly monitor quality-assurance processes in factories. Usually, these engineers are tied to their desks because they have to use enterprise software that runs only on their corporate desktops. \u201cIt\u2019s time to mobilize the quality-assurance industry,\u201d said Khurram Mir, CMO & Co-Founder of Kualitatem, the company that launched this application\n\nKualitatem was founded by these two bright young graduate students who, at that time, were looking to create Pakistan\u2019s first QA testing firm. It was formed as a university-incubator startup to develop innovative QA products and offer R&D-based, high-quality QA services to companies across the world.\n\nWhat did they bring to the startup in terms of expertise, one might ask?\u00a0 Jamil\u2019s Bachelor and Master Degrees in Computer Science and his four years of IT auditing experience and Khurram\u2019s MBA in Marketing, Bachelors in Computer Science, and with five years of QA experience, was a good beginning. And of course, the essential element \u2013 the will and passion to succeed despite all odds.\n\nKualitee is based on Web & iPhone based \u00a0interfaces. The web interface is made in flash and iPhone\u2019s version is a native app. The product is a SaaS based Test Management System and hence they have developed a process which is compact yet comprehensive. \u201cOur focus has been to ensure simplicity & ease of use of the product by all stakeholders of \u00a0the software development lifecycle,\u201d said Khurram. \u201cUnlike products which offer too many options and confuse clients, Kualitee offers a simple, efficient and easy-to-manage process. You can be at home or travelling the world with complete visibility into the test process\n\n at all times. Other testing platforms in the market, aside from Kualitee, include Zephyr and QMetry (SaaS based).\n\nKualitatem is making the product available to local Pakistani companies at a special price.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/12/22/violence-irresponsible-behaviour-cant-ever-be-justified/", "text": "I usually do not write about politics or politicians and restrict my blog to covering\u00a0 positive aspects of what is happening in this country. However, I am in no way an ostrich. I know that the world is a dangerous place and a lot of things take place that deserve to be condemned. This is one such occurrence. If I stay quiet I would never be able to forgive myself.\n\nA few days ago a young woman was gang-raped in Clifton. This is not the first occurrence of such a violent crime and unfortunately it won\u2019t be the last. Working on the Take Back the Tech campaign to end Violence against Women, I have seen digital stories from around the world and read accounts that have had my hair stand on edge.\n\nWhat I am finding hard to come to terms with is the way that one of our women politicians and the media have handled this entire matter. Instead of empathy and support for the young woman who is a survivor of this heinous crime, I have been absolutely flabbergasted to see nothing but unethical reporting of the case by many media organizations and irresponsible statements from Sharmila Farooqui who is the Advisor to the Chief Minister of Sind. It makes me wonder if they even understand what this young woman has been through.\n\nRape is a violent act. It is the worst crime imaginable and it totally violates the person it is perpetrated against. I don\u2019t even want to imagine what gang rape does to a person and how they are ever able to remain the same ever afterwards. To take away the focus from the crime in this instance by talking about the fact that the young woman was returning from a birthday party late at night, casting aspersions on her character, or saying anything else that remotely suggests that she was responsible for what happened to her, is to my mind totally unacceptable. Revealing the name of the survivor, trying to capture her on camera \u2013 my God do they even know what they are doing? Should they be in positions of responsibility? Shouldn\u2019t they be held accountable for making the situation worse for the rape survivor? Should we not ask them to explain themselves in the name of humanity if nothing else? If nothing else, shouldn\u2019t the privacy of a survivor be paramount?\n\nI am angry. I am disappointed. I am disgusted. I am confused at the total lack of sensitivity and the absolute idiocy of the parties concerned. The young woman in question has had two crimes committed against her \u2013 one was the violent act of gang rape that was perpetrated by her captors and the other was an equally reprehensible crime of unethical reporting by the media and irresponsible behaviour by the politician in question.\n\nMy friend Sana Saleem\u2019s post says it much better than I ever could in this Open Letter to Ms. Sharmila Farooqui and to the media. All of us need to raise our voices in protest.

Here are the two videos of these talks by Nuzhat Kidvai and Naveen Naqvi & Sana Saleem.\n\nThese talks were followed by a very compelling and powerful film that Beena Sarwar had made on Mukhtara Mai. It was the 9 minute version of the film. Hopefully we will be able to get her permission to put it up soon. The film started off what seemed much like a story circle \u2013 starting with comments on Mukhtara\u2019s courage and accomplishments and her ability to reach out and help others, with other people sharing their experiences of abuse. It was really an intense session.\n\nSabeen Mahmud then moderated a session on Online Social Activism. On the panel were Beena Sarwar who has been a journalist and a part of the women\u2019s movement, Atiya Dawood an activist and a poet, Farieha Aziz a young magazine journalist. Although the discussions started with the panel, everyone took part. The main question was whether online activism, online petititions, etc were actually effective and what was the reason that street protests were no longer the norm \u2013 why did people not turn up for them. The discussion was in English and Urdu with differing views \u2013 some saying that nothing could replace street protests, others of the view that with distances and security issues, and people being busy, online was where most of the mobilization and activity took place. I will put up the video in the next day or so.\n\nAll in all it was a great session.

In any of these cases, it is a brutal violation of a human being and is a serious offence.\n\nHowever, the violation that gets sidelined and is very often not even considered rape at all is marital rape.

In fact I was really excited at the possibility of seeing some of the entries that had been submitted.\n\nI remember putting up a post some time ago asking developers and companies to participate. I also remember sending out folders with posters and information regarding this challenge. I had thought it was a great effort on the part of Nokia to encourage development on the Symbian platform, and I hoped that the many talented developers would take advantage of the opportunity. Many did.\n\nGoing through the applications one by one, my fellow judges (Zia Imran MD of PSEB, Muhammad Amir Malik who is the Director ICT at the PTA, Farhan Chawla a blogger who is a Nokia specialist,Teemu Kiijarvi, Developer Relations Manager Nokia Middle East and Africa) and I spent two days over teleconference and face-to-face meetings to review the applications. The decision was unanimous. We all agreed that of all the applications submitted, the best ones were:\n\nWinner: Ten Pearls\u2019 Utrack \u2013 a multi-platform mobile application which provides a novel way of managing daily tasks easily and effectively streamlining one\u2019s life. This application allows user to visualize daily tasks and know his or her status at a glance. uTrack allows the user to track work tasks, school assignments, family obligations, etc. The concept is simple. The application features a virtual \u2018wall\u2019 where the user can put up sticky notes with their to-do\u2019s. Once the user decides to start the task, they can simply drag the sticky note from the \u2018To-Do\u2019 column to \u2018In Progress\u2019, \u2018Done\u2019 or \u2018Verify\u2019.\n\nPakistan\u2019s First Gully (street) Cricket Mobile Game that offers nationwide competition and it also solves the copyright issues of application developers in the developing countries i.e. follow registration model for each application.\n\nFunSMS by Edumid Pakistan is a free SMS chat software that makes Text Messaging colourful, vibrant and media rich. It bridges the gap between internet and text messaging as users can send link of audio, videos and other web content using FunSMS and the content will be downloaded displayed and played on the recipient\u2019s phone.\n\nThe winner was awarded Rs. 1,000,000 by the PTA Chairman Dr. Muhammad Yaseen; the first runner up was awarded Rs. 500,000 and the second runner up received Rs. 300,000.\n\nUnfortunately I was down with bacterial pharyngitis and could not attend the event. However, I am told by those who did that the morning session, which included a Developers workshop, proved to be very useful.\n\nThese kind of initiatives help to drive people to challenge themselves and I hope that Nokia, and others, will continue to invest in mobile applications development in this country.\n\nHowever, one of the things that should perhaps be kept in mind next time round is that perhaps there should be a division of categories \u2013 professional companies that are a few years old, products that are in beta, products that have been in the market for a while, completely new products developed for the challenge, products developed by university students or freelancers. It was difficult for the judges to compare apples with oranges. However, since the parameters hadn\u2019t been defined, awards were given on the basis the best app overall.\n\nI was happy to be a part of this activity and P@SHA will continue to work with Nokia to raise the bar in terms of innovation in the mobile space.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Mobile app developers win cash prizes at the Nokia Innovators\u00a0challenge"},

Very well put together by BBCL. I had dressed appropriately in black to fit in with the theme. No it was not a requirement. Just thought it would be cool to do so :).\u00a0 Ran into a lot of people I hadn\u2019t seen for a while. It was good to catch up.\n\nAs we waited for the proceedings to begin, the MC went around and spoke to various people about the event, about why they were there, about the local industry, about the opportunities that were out there for us to capitalize on, about various Microsoft technologies, expectations, etc. etc. All these interviews were run live on the many screens within the hall.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Country General Manager Kamal Ahmed had been sitting at our table playing host, cracking jokes and generally networking, but when his name was finally called so that the proceedings could begin, there was no sign of him. As we scanned the room for him, the door on the stage opened and he walked through Microsoft\u2019s Open Door \u2013 quite cool Kamal! Quite cool!\n\nKamal talked about the key innovations in Microsoft technologies and development tools and gave a birds eye view of the MS technology space and the sectors in which they were being used to make life easier and allow for processes to be smoother.\n\nIhsan Anabtawi from Microsoft\u2019s regional office) then took all of us on a journey of the Future of Productivity. He showed us some of the ways in which technology is already being used and how it was likely to be used in the immediate future. Ihsan\u2019s presentation made people like me pine to live and work in the kind of digital environment he showed us through the videos. It all looked possible and plausible \u2013 and seemed an absolute dream for gadget freaks like me. My friend Naveed Bajwa from Microsoft had asked me to talk about the innovation in the Pakistan IT sector at the event \u2013 a subject that I can never say enough about. It thrills me to relate the stories of the many successes from across the country. Slide presentations being what they are, and time being limited to 30 minutes, I could only talk about a limited number of companies. However, obviously it was enough to excite the visitors from Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0 regional offices. They were amazed at the kind of product development that was taking place in Pakistan and the kind of high end services being offered by a number of our companies. As often happens with me, a CEO from a member company whom I didn\u2019t talk about, came up to me afterward to congratulate me on a great presentation and to say (very sweetly) that he wanted to come and see me and excite me enough about what his company was doing, so that I would include him in any subsequent presentation. True to his word he came over to the P@SHA office the following day and told me the story of his professional life and his company\u2019s accomplishments. I was thrilled to learn of his achievements and there is no doubt tha t the company will be added to my innovation stack. :) One of the new Microsoft executives whom I met was Asli Bilgin, Web Strategy Lead for Middle East & Africa. A bubbly and passionate young woman born in Turkey, brought up in the US and living in Dubai. Asli was so excited about the talent that exists in Pakistan and the many opportunities that young technologists here need to grasp. We talked about several initiatives that we could embark upon and I am certainly looking forward to working with her. There are few people who enjoy what they do and whose work puts them on an absolute high. Asli is one of those people, and anyone who met her was totally caught up in the excitement she exuded. Stephane Consalvi is an old friend from Microsoft whose dedication and commitment to making a difference, has always impressed me. He travels so much that I am surprised he can call any place home. We are fortunate that he has a special love for Pakistan and the development community here. Over the years he and I have met several times and there has never been a time that I have not wondered where he gets all that energy from. It is always great for young developers to interact with this man who not only has a great deal of knowledge but is ever so ready to share it with others.\n\nAs the inaugural session was coming to an end, our MC Faizan informed us that there was a surprise awaiting us. Out popped someone you would never expect to see at a technology event \u2013 Ali Azmat! Yes yes the singer! Do you know any other Ali Azmat? And a surprise he certainly was. As Ali Azmat performed number after number, it was funny to see the room full of formally dressed young executives, and the older ones too, not quite knowing how to react. You know how people compartmentalize events? So this was a conference \u2013 not a concert. They had come to hob-nob with technology gurus, not listen to Ali Azmat sing. So most of them just sat there not reacting at all, prompting the singer to say: If you were any more stiff, you would be in a morgue. Aeiiiiiyah! He didn\u2019t make many friends with that remark \u2013 and I won\u2019t repeat what Kamal Ahmed said in response to this ;-). Anyway, if the purpose was to wake people up before they split up into tracks and got into the serious business of learning, then it worked. Everyone was wide awake and raring to go. Events such as this are important from several perspectives \u2013 the knowledge sharing, the networking and simply the excitement around technology. Well done Microsoft. We hope this will become an annual event \u2013 and hopefully it will be held in more than one city.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Microsoft\u2019s conference returns in great\u00a0style!"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/11/16/which-should-it-be-relief-or-anger/", "text": "I have been down with very high fever since Friday. Friends and colleagues suggested I get a test done for dengue fever which has been attacking a lot of people in the region this year.\n\nFirst a confession \u2013 I must admit that the mere thought of contracting dengue again, was terrifying. I\u2019ve had it once already \u2013 exactly 3 years ago. That was the first time I had been hospitalized since my birth, and believe me, although the hospital was very nice and the medical staff were very competent, the experience is not something I would like to go through again. I hate hospitals having spent many weeks with my mother (and, more recently, with my father) in several of them around the world.\n\nBut I had to find out whether what I had was dengue. So I went to a lab near my home and gave my blood for an IgM test (recommended test for dengue), CBC, LFT, etc etc. I figured i should do that on Saturday morning although I could hardly get out of bed, let alone walk or drive. I had to miss the National ICT Policy Roundtable which was jointly organized by P@SHA & BytesforAll. Anyhow, managed to go with my father\u2019s driver to the lab. Deepset narrow veins means blood tests can be a painful experience. This one was no different but at least it was over with.\n\nThen the wait began. All day as I dropped in and out of sleep, I wondered what the test would reveal. When I finally got the results at around 7.30 pm, I was depressed to see the IgM test (for detecting dengue fever) was positive. The CBC showed bacterial infections but it was the positve for dengue that scared the daylights out of me.\n\nMy doctor, who is available on SMS/Email/Mobile (you\u2019ve got to love the guy for being technology savvy and for being available to patients at any time) told me to scan all the results and send them to him. Unfortunately I had taken my scanner to the office so I didn\u2019t have it at home. I typed in some of the results and emailed them to the doc. He phoned back and told me not to worry. Asked some questions and told me to get another CBC done on Monday before I went in to see him at the clinic. If there\u2019s one person I listen to in terms of my health, it is my doctor so I did exactly what he asked.\n\nIn the meantime, I had been going crazy (and driving others insane) with my desperate questions on Twitter and Facebook regarding dengue. Thanks to everyone for their advice and support.\n\nNow for the anti-climax. I saw my doc yesterday and guess what? Although I tested positive for dengue, I don\u2019t have dengue. Huh? Yes you heard/read correctly. Apparently, there have been a lot of false positives and false negatives in terms of the IgM test. My doctor tells me that because of the false positives and negatives a lot of people who have typhoid or other such problems are being treated for dengue, and those with dengue are being treated for something else.\n\nIn his opinion (and I agree with him 100%) the IgM test is unnecessary and expensive (costs around Rs. 1200). The best thing to do is get a Complete Blood Count (CBC) done. This costs Rs. 500 and several things within the CBC will indicate whether you have dengue or not. The Platelet Count is the first indicator \u2013 if it is normal, there is no way you have dengue. The Haemoglobin level, the Haematocrit level, the White Blood Cells are all clear indicators as well. And last but not least, the SGPT (Alt) would be shooting through the roof.\n\nSo I needn\u2019t have tortured myself. I needn\u2019t have worried. I needn\u2019t have scared my family and friends. If only I hadn\u2019t\u00a0 had the IgM test done, this could have been avoided. If I had been aware of all the indicators, as I am now, I would have known the reason for the high fever was not the poor dengue mosquito.\n\nWhat I do have is Bacterial Pharyngitis and I am now under treatment for that. Another 3-4 days and I should be fine \u2013 and all this will be a faint memory. I am relieved no doubt but I am also angry. Why should anyone have to go through this sort of thing simply because of a test that is inaccurate, unnecessary and expensive to boot? If I had asked my doctor before having the test done, he would have simply asked me to get the CBC done. My mistake was to assume I knew what was needed before I saw the doctor. But what about the many doctors who prescribe the IgM test? Why don\u2019t they know better?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Which should it be \u2013 relief or\u00a0anger?"},

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/10/26/amazingly-weird-people/", "text": "Every year for the past 5 \u2013 6 years I have been working with individuals who have dedicated much of their valuable time toward making sure that the depth that exists in the Pakistan IT industry is recognized domestically and across the region. They have spent countless hours, days and many a sleepless night working with companies and individuals to ensure that they are ready to face the tough criteria laid down by the Asia Pacific ICT Awards (APICTA) Judging Committee. The same criteria is used to assess applications submitted for the P@SHA ICT Aw ards.\n\nEach year I continue to be amazed by the selfless dedication of these individuals. Why do they do it? Some people think it is because I bully them into it, that they can\u2019t refuse otherwise I would nag them to kingdom come. But that is not it \u2013 that is not it at all.\n\nThese gentlemen have faith in the expertise and talent that exists in Pakistan and they have a strong belief that the applications developed here are second to none in technological innovation and quality. Customers that our companies have worked with are already aware of this. However, the message needs to be broadcast far and wide for us to be able to scale up as only we know we can. And what better way to do that than to ensure that we are present at international events where we can benchmark our applications with those developed in other hi-tech markets \u2013 and prove ourselves beyond question to be at par with them, if not better.\n\nOn several visits to APICTA we have taken over conference rooms, executive lounges, lobbies or hung out in one of our rooms with several teams of nominees till the early hours, going over presentations, demanding they be rebuilt from scratch, tweaking the way presentations are delivered, asking tough questions, being absolutely ruthless in ou r comments. The reason? It is better that nominees go through this \u201chell\u201dwith us rather than in front of an international panel. Sometimes I wonder what goes through the minds of CEOs, CTOs, VPs and Directors of organizations as they are ripped apart by these seasoned judges a few days, or sometimes even the night before they are to make their presentations at APICTA.\n\nDo they hate us? Do they ask themselves \u201cWho do they think they are anyway?\u201d. Do they curse us in the deep recesses of their hearts? Well, apparently not (or maybe they are just not admitting it?) ;)\n\nThis partial message from one of our nominees at APICTA 2010 warmed our hearts:\n\nQUOTE\n\n Getting crucified & pushed forward at the same time by the judges has given us tremendous confidence in what we\u2019re up to. And by trying to show you why \u2018xyz\u2019 is important and how we can make it grow faster, we have also learned why it\u2019s important and how to grow it f aster. So you probably made us learn a lot more than you know :) I wanted to write to you to show my sincere appreciation for the awesomeness, dedication and competence of the entire team.\n\n UNQUOTE\n\nIt is one of several messages that we have received so far and it shows that nominees understand and appreciate that no matter how \u201cvicious\u201d the training may seem, the intent is a good one and usually delivers results.\n\nIt is only when people travel with us, or are involved in training locally before the teams depart for an international destination, do they realiz e the \u201cblood and sweat\u201d and teamwork that goes into prepping for these Awards. From the time the nominees win the local Awards, they are connected with mentors in the three main cities \u2013 Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, and the rigorous task of training them for international participation begins.\n\nThose who take advantage of this opportunity, and implement the changes that they are asked to, benefit. Those who don\u2019t, wish they had. It is a lesson learnt the hard way.\n\nAlthough it is important to take some of the same Judges to APICTA each year because they have built up a rapport with judges from the region, and also have a certain amount of credibility with the organizers, it is also important to add on new judges so that the pool of mentors and judges continues to expand over time. So each year we recruit at least one new judge. This also shows our friends in the region that we have a large number of qualified professionals within our industry.\n\nAnd you know what? It is not only the judges that adopt this \u201call for one and one for all\u201d attitude. Nominees to APICTA and previous winners are also drawn into the magic circle. You can see them helping each other, working with each other, making suggestions, and celebrating the success of their comrades. The unity is great to see, wonderful to experience.\n\nAs I watch these guys each year mentoring, coaching, demonstrating, as they fight sleep and are ready to pull their hair out while explaining for the umpteenth time why sales presentations won\u2019t work at competitions such as APICTA, I can\u2019t keep the smile from my lips. These are people I trust, people whom I have great respect for and whose opinions matter to me and to all the teams that they have worked with over the years. I am proud to count them amongst my circle of friends. Thank you Jawwad, Zafar, Sultan, Nadeem, Adnan, Badar, Yusuf, Imran and all the others who continue to contribute to the success and growth of this industry that we all believe in and cherish.\n\nI just re-read the post Jawwad Farid wrote as he left APICTA 2010 and I simply had to add these two bits from his post (though I really would suggest that you read the entire post he has written on this subject):\n\nThe process changes all of us. It changes the participants first of all because they are now able to look beyond their sales presentation and look upon themselves as ambassadors to the region. It changes us as Judges as we see the quality of work and the commitment of our delegation to not just winning but putting our best foot forward as a group. But most importantly it changes everyone who sees the results from APICTA EXCO members to delegates from twenty two countries in the region, who look at how far we have come in the last few years, despite all our challenges and handicaps. More importantly it allows us to reset the benchmark for everyone; for what qualifies as the best of the best in the Asia Pacific region when it comes to technology and the impact it must create on every life that it touches. At the Jakarta APICTA Awards in 2008 all our hard work was validated with three wins. TPS, Pixsense and Kraysis came back home with the winners trophies. The 7 merit awards across 6 diverse categories at APICTA 2010, Kula Lumpur, Malaysia, this Friday, proved that our wins in Singapore, Jakarta and Australia were not flukes. Great software gets written in Pakistan by great engineers who with a little bit of brow beating and abuse from their mentors (onsite and offsite) are able to stand on their own and make great pitches in front of international judges. Even nominees that don\u2019t pick up the first two wins no longer come home empty handed. They come back with the respect of their fellow delegates, of the panel of judges who reviewed and judged them and of the mentors who worked with them. For in the end the difference between success and failure is but a few decisions and that has never been more truer than at APICTA.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Amazingly weird people \u2013 what would we do without\u00a0them?"},

Training and Mentoring sessions were arranged for them in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad where Jawwad Ahmed Farid, Zafar Khan, Nadeem Aslam Malik, Zia Imran \u2013 all former APICTA judges \u2013 and Yusuf Jan (a P@SHA ICT Awards Judge) and Adnan Agboatwalla (twice APICTA Awards winner) looked at presentations, gave advice on the judging criteria and tore sales presentations to shreds.\n\nAs judges and nominees started to arrive in Kuala Lumpur, the mentoring and prep sessions began. We took over the Traders Lounge a couple of times (although that really is meant for the people staying on the Executive Floor and not their entire teams), we used the Board room twice and Zafar Khan\u2019s room was the scene of some of the late night sessions. Some sessions were even held in the Food Court and Burger King at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre (KLCC). The commitment of the judges and the dedication of the nominees gives one heart.\n\nEach year I see this. Successful entrepreneurs like Zafar and Jawwad, Nadeem and Sultan, Yusuf, Imran and Badar, take time off from their busy work lives to travel to some part of the world to work with these teams. They give up time with family and are totally sleep deprived the week they are at APICTA \u2013 all for one reason and one reason only. They want Pakistan to do their best, to put up the greatest performance, to showcase the innovation that exists.\n\nSometimes some of the judges are extremely brutal in their assessment of the presentations but I think nominees have begun to understand that those who listen to the feedback, actually benefit. You may have the most brilliant sales presentation on the face of the planet but it could do very badly at APICTA simply because it does not answer the key questions that APICTA judges are looking for answers to.\n\nAs we worked with the teams this year, we found them to be very receptive, very cooperative and willing to put in the time that was needed to revamp presentations and to rehearse them. And that makes our jobs as mentors worth the effort. Their success (and here I measure success not only in terms of awards, but also in terms of showing a regional group of highly qualified people the diversity and depth of the technology and business innovation that Pakistan is capable of) makes us proud. They make us proud. Their attitude, their willingness to listen and adapt brings us a great of satisfaction.\n\nAnd you know what else? This year we saw how we work as a team even at the nominee level. Junaid Khan advising the Folio 3 team on their presentation, Yasir and Bilal from Primatics helping Muadh \u2013 a candidate in the Tertiary Student Category; each one of them trying to hep the other become more proficient, giving them a better chance of performing at an optimal level. It was great to see and warmed our hearts.

APICTA gave me the opportunity to get to know him better \u2013 and I have come to a decision. I need to arrange a P@SHA get-together where Hasnain must share his story. He is an ex-Air Force guy who is an absolutely brilliant engineer. He has created some of the best and most innovative engineering products \u2013 solutions that address existing problems that are being faced by Pakistan and the world. But all this is something you absolutely must hear from him.\n\nAt APICTA Hasnain was calm as our mentors made him revamp his presentation to give it an APICTA-fit. He worked hard, rehearsed and even put on a suit (much as he would have preferred to present in the red t-shirt he was wearing).\n\nHasnain\u2019s products are developed with one aim in mind \u2013 inclusion. His ATMs alongwith their software, are created to address the needs of the unbanked sector in Pakistan and the region. They are inexpensive, rugged and open to abuse by heat and dust and other such conditions. Their impact on the developing world is something that cannot be questioned. So it is not surprising that Aerocar won the Merit Award in the E-Inclusion & E-Community category at APICTA. Congratulations Hasnain.

There were some great products in his category and sometimes the difference between winning and not winning is a score difference of 0.02. That is why I tried to bring him down to earth so that he would be optimistic but not overly so.\n\nI expressed my concern to Jawwad, Zafar, Yusuf and Badar who were the Pakistani judges at APICTA and they agreed that we needed to keep expectations real but hope for the best.

As I stood there at the podium watching the 550 people who had gathered for the event, there was a feeling of absolute joy and satisfaction. Many weeks of hard work and sleepless nights had gone into the planning and execution of this event but it was all worth it.\n\nThis was the first time the P@SHA ICT Awards had been taken on the road. The decision had been made by the Central Executive Committee of P@SHA that we should come out of our comfort zone and start rotating this flagship event across different key cities of Pakistan. Lahore, therefore, was the first choice. There is so much technology innovation happening in Lahore, so many successful companies and startups, so much talent coming out of the major universities.\n\nParticipation at the event i ncluded professionals, university students, startups, corporates, government officials, the media and bloggers not only from Lahore but also from Karachi, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Multan, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Peshawar and Sialkot. Student volunteers for the event came from 8 different universities. And the Royal Palm Golf & Country Club made for such a beautiful venue.\n\nThe proceedings started with an able recitation from the Quran by Awais, a Masters student from FAST Islamabad and a blogger & aspiring entrepreneur. Then we played Green & White, the theme song for the event, which was written and produced by Yusuf Jan. It was a great start to the proceedings which were\u00a0mainly a combination of the announcement of our Oscars interspersed with musical performances by various groups \u2013 the FAST Music Society, a combination of rock, rap and pop by the UCP Music Society, S ajid Hussain from Sofizar \u2013 a talented SEO specialist and a vocalist, the sweet voice of Maleeha Azeem and a duet by Maleeha and Nighat Dad, a TBTT activist and IP lawyer.\n\nAwards were given in 20 different categories. 130 nominations were received this year \u2013 the highest ever. A complete list of winners is provided here \u2013 P@SHA ICT Awards Winners List.\n\nOne of the unique things about this year was that 3 new categories were introduced: E-Marketplace, Mobile Games and Animation. There is a lot of interesting work being done in this space and it was importnat to recognize the new breed of companies who were making a mark for themselves both in the domestic and international arena.\n\nThis year, for the first time, one company won in 4 different categories \u2013 E-Government, Security, Communications and Research & Development. The name of the company: Center for Advanced Research in Engineering (CARE) from Islamabad. A group of PhDs quietly working away on producing really cutting-edge technologies that are being used both in Pakistan and in countries in the region.\n\nNone of this could have happened without the support of our sponsors \u2013 Naseer Akhtar President & CEO of Infotech who not only took on the Platinum Sponsorship but also arranged for us to host the event at the Royal Palm, Microsoft Pakistan who once again took on the Gold Sponsorship, wi-tribe who came to the party for the first time with a Silver Sponsorship & also provided free wifi and online streaming, PSEB and IBM who continued to play their role by sponsoring the Bronze. Zia Imran, MD of PSEB, was also actively involved at various stages of the planning for the event, Intel who continues to support our activities each year; Mixit, Dell & Oracle who supported the Tertiary Student Category thus enabling us to recognize good work being done by young upcoming talent in Pakistan. And of course Google who was the Digital Marketing Partner and CIO Pakistan who continue to be our Technology Media Partner. Rabia Garib, Editor-in-Chief of CIO Pakistan, was also my co-host for the evening.\n\nLast but not least, the young people without whom I would have been totally lost \u2013 Rafaeel Akbar Chaudhry who took on a lot of the organizational activity including Sound, Lights, Projection System, Photography & Video; Zaeem Yaqoob Khan and Maria from UCP who, together with Rafaeel, identified the young Volunteers who were there at every stage of the execution of the event; Usman Latif who led the bloggers initiative and worked with the wi-tribe team, Iftikhar Hussain who brought Pepsi Sting into our lives and was there to lend a hand with the organizational work, Rohan Emmanuel who went off to buy various things that we needed at the last minute and so many others who did their part to make the event into the stupdendous success that it was.\n\nFrom my team, Mustafa Parmar was there at every step over the past two months making sure that all the nominations were in, that the collateral (the cool knapsacks with the tshirts, mugs and notebooks) was ready in time, that the banners were printed, that it was all shipped out to Ovex Technologies (thanks to Faisal Khan who allowed us to use his office for storage and who arranged to send all the goodies to the venue and offered transportation and any help that we required) and Mustafa even reconstructed some of the Awards that came apart during the shipping process. Thank you Mustafa for all that you do :-).\n\nBefore we broke up for dinner at 9.30 pm, the CIO Pakistan team was asked to come and cut their second birthday cake \u2013 Blogger Haris Nadeem and I conspired to make sure that Lahore celebrated the birthday even if it was a belated celebration.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "P@SHA ICT Awards 2010 in Lahore was an absolute\u00a0blast!"},

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/10/04/bureaucratic-procedures-may-prevent-pakistans-representation-at-gitex-dubai/", "text": "Up until now the Pakistan IT industry believed that our government did not realize the importance of the ICT sector. Unlike other countries in the region and elsewhere in the world, our government is unable to recognise that the IT sector delivers across a wide spectrum, hence \u2018silo\u2019 mentality treatment is inappropriate. We thought they were oblivious to the fact that IT not only brings in revenues and provides well-paid employment to young people, but is also responsible for the improved efficiency of all other business sectors, of education and healthcare institutions and of government.\n\nThis week we have realized that a few things that the industry relied on the government for, are also being withdrawn due to idiotic bureaucratic procedures.\n\nOne event that the Pakistan IT industry has been participating in for 10 years is Gitex Dubai. Companies\u00a0 have found that it is a great place to showcase their work, network with potential customers and partners from the Middle East and Africa and pick up business. The Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) has subsidized this participation each year.\n\nYes there are last minute hitches now and again and complaints are lodged about inefficiencies in arrangements and business matchmaking sessions but overall it has been an activity that has helped several companies in growing their businesses.\n\nThe process of shortlisting companies for this year\u2019s Gitex took place a couple of months ago and companies sent in cheques amounting to Rs. 1.4 million to PSEB toward their participation. They then embarked on creating customized collateral for the event, fixing up meeting pre and post event and booking airline tickets and hotel rooms (anyone who has been to Gitex knows that this needs to be done well in advance).\n\nOn Friday participating companies were informed that all these weeks of preparation might be for nought. Apparently the PSEB which we are told has been set up to promote and increase the IT exports from Pakistan has not yet had their budgets for the year approved. They have been functioning on self-sustaining funds generated through the sale of fibre optic connectivity while they wait for the funds to be released.\n\nParticipation in Gitex would not have happened if not for the PSEB MD getting permission for the Federal IT Secretary to use the existing funds towards this event. This could then be replenished once the budgets were released. Okay so the problem seemed to have been sorted out, right? Noooooooo. The PSEB then had to apply to the Ministry of Finance so that it could purchase dollars to pay for the stall space at Gitex. The Ministry of Finance is not in a mood to grant that permission or is at least dilly-dallying over it until the extended deadline for payment has passed. Remember Gitex takes place Oct 17 \u2013 22, 2010 in Dubai\u00a0 so we are already well behind in terms of payments.\n\nIf the Ministry of Finance does not give PSEB the clearance to purchase dollars today, participation in Gitex will not come about. Companies will not only have tied up their funds for this period of time, they will also have wasted money and time preparing collateral, booking tickets, hotel rooms and arranging meetings.\n\nCan we appeal for good sense to prevail and for the Ministry of Finance to grant the permission PSEB needs? As it is PSEB has not been able to run most of its programs \u2013 apprenticeship, internship, CMMI, ISO, training programs etc because of the delay in the release of the budget. If the government really does not think that this organization needs to operate, and is of any benefit to the industry, then why does it exist?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Bureaucratic procedures may prevent Pakistan\u2019s participation at Gitex\u00a0Dubai"},

One such issue is that of permanent housing. For the moment, temporary shelter in the form of tents has been provided by most NGOs and relief organizations. But we need to remember that this is just a temporary measure. We need a permanent rehabilitation solution. That is why I was happy to see that some organisations have already started working toward this goal.\n\nOne such organisation is the Heritage Foundation who have been working in the Swat region providing what they call Guided\u00a0 Self Help Shelters \u2013 Green KaravanGhar. The initiative is led by renowned architect Yasmin Lari who worked with the IDPs in Swat and the northern areas during the earthquake.\n\nThe cost of shelter of size 18\u2032 6\u2033\u2019x 10\u2032 3\u2033, including supervision costs, is US$ 400. Another US$100 will provide the basic necessities for restarting lives. It is a green structure with low carbon footprint. The basic structure of the shelter from foundation to roof will be completed in 5 days, while the finishing by the family is expected to take another 5 days. The total construction time is 10 days.\n\nAccording to a e-flyer that a young friend who is working with them sent me, the structure will be constructed by skilled artisans, while finishing will be carried out by the family members. The shelter is the core unit to which more rooms or verandahs can be added later on.\n\nAccording to the Heritage Foudation, the design of the shelter is based on local and vernacular materials. It has been carefully designed by professionals at Heritage Foundation and eminent civil engineers Amin Tariq Associates. The structure is constructed with bamboo posts and cross bracing in walls, and bamboo ring beams and joists in the roof. The foundations are constructed with stone masonry using lime and sand mortar while a small amount of cement is used in foundation pad and grouting for mild steel bars for anchoring purposes. The finishing of the structure e.g. filling the cross bracing with stone, debris or brick, lime-mud plaster to walls, floor and roof will be carried out under guidance by the family itself. This is one way for them to feel a sense of ownership and also to learn how to add extra rooms to the structure at a later stage.\n\nThe work will be supervised by student volunteers (architectural/engineering students) drawn from various participating universities. This mechanism provides the youth of the country an opportunity to help fellow Pakistanis in restarting their lives.

Companies that are less then 24 months old have been invited to participate under this scheme.\n\nThe total cost of the trip for one person representing a member company, is less than Rs. 100,000 and includes all associated costs, such as exhibition space, visa cost, airfare,\u00a0 lodging/boarding etc. Selected companies will be provided with a\u00a0 counter and a bar stool at the Pakistan Pavilion at Gitex. Whereas Rs. 100,000 is nothing to sneeze at, usually participation at an exhibition like Gitex costs a whole lot more so those young companies that can afford it should certainly grab hold of this opportunity.\n\nThis cost can be reduced to Rs. 30 \u2013 35K if you can find someone to put you up in Dubai, feed you and take you to the exhibition every day. It has been suggested that this may be a wasted exercise for young companies. My take is that for 35K if you can get the exposure, work the show, see what is happening in the IT space regionally, then it is money well spent even if you don\u2019t generate direct business benefits from it. Usually participating at an exhibition is not meant to generate immediate business. It is a long term exercise but some small companies have actually been able to sign contracts at Gitex so who knows?\n\nAccording to a PSEB email shot that has been sent out:\n\nGITEX Dubai (OCTOBER 17 \u2013 21, 2010) is one of the top information technology events in the world and is considered to be the most critical and important platform for buyers and sellers in the Middle East as well as the African Continent. The IT sector in the Middle East is booming despite the global slowdown. Middle East based companies are expected to spend approximately US$50 Billion on IT related products and the region is forecast to show highest year-on-year IT spending growth in the world. At 11 %. Dubai alone is expected to spend US$ 4.79 Billion on ICT investments in 2010, an increase of 12.4%. Furthermore, Pakistani IT companies report that the probability of securing projects are higher in the Middle East as compared to the North American/European Markets. Interested member companies of PSEB and P@SHA are invited to submit their Expression of Interest (EOI) along with the following: * Duly filled-in Application Form\n\n * Company Profile\n\n * Objectives Statement and associated Strategy to attain results from participation in the exhibition\n\n * Signed TORs and Payment of Rs.5,000 in the form of Demand Draft. Application forms and TORs are available at:\n\n http://www.pseb.org.pk/UserFiles/documents/Application_Form_exhibition.pdf.

I am not much into gaming but Wordity is simple, easy-to-use, intuitive and nicely designed \u2013 and yet it challenges you to think up new words.\n\nWordity is a great arcade word game experience. It offers 4 different game modes: Classic, Anagrams, Word Search and Challenge \u2013 each interesting in itself.\u00a0At first I could only get to Level 3 (I told you I am not good at games) but after I had played for the third time, I reached as high as Level 12 and felt extremely accomplished :).\n\nAccording to the developers, Wordity Classic is a new game mode that is best described as a mixture of Bejewled and Scrabble! You post your high score on our Openfeint leaderboards and unlock achievements as you weave your way through the Wordity Challenge.\n\nIt costs 99 cents and is available as a Download from the Apple App Store. Take it from me, it is well worth it. Once you have played with it and are happy with the results, remember to go write a review and rate the game.\n\nThis is not the first game that Mindstorm\u00a0Studios has developed for the App Store. Other interesting games include Whacksy Taxi, Farm Break and Tetra Defence. I have personally tried Whacksy Taxi and although racing games are not my thing, I must admit I rather enjoyed it. And as far as the graphics are concerned, there is only one word for them \u2013 AWESOME!

Having gone through a bout of dengue myself a couple of years ago, I know how debilitating it can be \u2013 and of course in some cases, it can be fatal.\n\nThis year because of the devasting floods, the threat of diseases like malaria have become even more terrifying. And the news from across the border in India, is really troubling. According to media reports top cardiologists in Bombay warn that an angerous mutation of malaria vivax strain is leading to heart attacks among patients.\n\nDoctors have come across many patients over the past couple of months who had no heart ailments prior to the malaria, nor was there any family history of cardiac problems, who suffered from strokes after being down with malaria vivax for a few days. Many of these patients were not people whom you would have classified as being prone to heart disease. They were not overweight, did not drink or smoke, had healthy lifestyles and many were in their 20s and 30s.\n\nAccording to doctors, when malarial parasite enters blood cells it ruptures them and leads to clotting. This is exactly what happens in patients\u2019 arteries thus disrupting flow of blood and leading to heart attacks,\n\nThe risk of outbreaks is greatly increased in flood areas because of complicating factors such as changes in human behaviour like increased exposure to mosquitoes while sleeping outside, overcrowding or changes in the habitat which promote mosquito breeding like landslides, river damming and and rerouting.\n\nRelief workers need to address the threat of malaria even more urgently and create awareness amongst the flood survivors so that fatalities are reduced. Reducing overcrowding, providing shelter and mosquito coils, ensuring that people are moved away from stagnant water are all measures that need to be taken.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Mutation of malaria strain leading to heart\u00a0attacks"},

In an email sent out to the community in Pakistan, Google Pakistan Consultant Badar Khushnood, reveals that Google has created a crisis response page (Urdu) that hosts a variety of tools and compiles information about the disaster, including the latest news from local media sources, any available satellite imagery of the affected areas, and ways to donate to verified NGOs supporting the relief effort. It can also be accessed from the Google.com.pk homepage.\n\nThe Pakistan Person Finder Tool can be used to submit or search for information about people who may be missing in the floods. Similarly, the Pakistan Resource Finder Tool helps disseminate updated information about health facility services, including doctors, equipment and beds available, which may change rapidly during the disaster.

Like there is no privacy? Like you can\u2019t hide even when you want to enjoy a few moments of complete peace and silence? I have begun to feel that way sometimes. Partly it is my fault for having my mobile number, my email address, and my Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn ID on my visiting card.

It is also possible that your email could slip through the cracks or end up in my spam folder. Don\u2019t be heartbroken. Just give me a bit of time and then re-send it if you don\u2019t hear from me.\n\n5. The Facebook Wall \u2013 I have left the settings open so that if there is anything relevant that someone wants to post, they can, but when people start posting their sales messages and flyers on my wall, I begin to lose it. Please remember it is my wall. Tag me in\u00a0 photos or cartoons or advocacy messages but please refrain from posting political or commercial messages. Respect my space.\n\n6. If you want to meet with me, call my office. Make an appointment. Don\u2019t just walk in. I will probably not be there and even if I am, I may be in another meeting. Save your time and respect mine. If you have made an appointment to meet with me, please be on time. It shows me that you value time.\n\n7. If you comment on my blog, don\u2019t be anonymous. You know who I am. I should know who you are otherwise your opinion doesn\u2019t hold much value. I didn\u2019t moderate the comments on my blog to begin with but then I started doing it because sometimes people would use the opportunity to post defamatory comments against other people or they would just try and be negative about someone for the sake of \u201cbringing them down\u201d. It is my blog. I believe in free speech but I also believe that with free speech comes a certain responsibility.\n\nEntry filed under: Posts.

Of course you need to buy these bags for Rs. 99 each which I don\u2019t mind paying because it is a one-time investment and I can use them again and again. The bags are quite strong and large and can accommodate a lot of groceries at one time.\n\n Is there a \u2018but\u2019 coming up? Yes you guessed it. There certainly is. Considering that Metro is not giving these bags away for free, and I am having to pay Rs. 99 for each one that I buy, why am I then forced to promote their 3 sponsors who have obviously given them the money for the bags? Am I missing something here?\n\nMetro is not a charity or an NGO so it is absolutely not justified that they should have it both ways. Either I pay for bags that are not defaced with so many large logos, or I get them for free \u2013 then of course I have no reason to complain. What say you?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The story of the environmentally-friendly bags"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/face2face-grabs-the-attention-of-local-international-media/", "text": "Whenever a Pakistani IT company develops a new product, I am almost as thrilled as the developers themselves \u2013 maybe even more so! So when Shakir Husain, CEO of Creative Chaos, tweeted me to ask if I would come to the Media launch of Face2Face, an application developed by the Proximate Global team in Pakistan, I immediately accepted the invitation and slotted the event on my calendar, even though I had two other events that I had to attend that day.\n\nHow could I miss the opportunity to meet with the CEO of Proximate Global Hameed Khan, CTO Umair Aziz, Director Shakir Hussain, Mehdi Hussain (who is part of the Proximate Global Pakistan team and was formerly with PixSense)? I must also admit that I was curious to see the product in action.\n\nSo there I was in the beautifully done up PC Banquet Hall \u2013 kudos to Xenith PR for creating a lovely environment for the launch event \u2013 watching Hameed Khan presenting the functionalities of the new application the company had created.\n\nInteresting to read what Hameed had written a few months earlier on the face2face blog \u2013 the day the app had been accepted by the iPhone App Store:\n\nUMAIR & SHAKIR: These two gentlemen are the brains behind it all\u2026actually making the software that we all dreamed up. They are the brains of Creative Chaos. Remember their names, because when you want to tap off an angry or excited email about something you wish you was a little different, or you want to congratulate them for making such a killer app, they\u2019re the ones you should email! AMER & SULAIMAN Best friends from Yale. They come up with the procedures and the systems to take that dreamy idea and turn it into reality. ME, HAMEED Well, by now you probably know enough about me. On second thought, if you want to congratulate anyone, it should probably be me. Redirect all queries, criticisms and suggestions to the other guys. That\u2019s what I pay them for! Seriously though\u2026we\u2019ve been waiting for this day for months. The whole gang and I are going to celebrate by piling into a little Suzuki hatchback and driving over to boat basin for some ice cream. Face you later!\n\nSo what is Face2Face you might well ask? It is an application for your smartphone that instantly enables you to consolidate your existing social networks \u2013 Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace and Twitter. It also enables you to send instant messages. You can also view and comment on aggregated newsfeeds and can update your status across networks.\n\nHow is it different from existing location based apps like Loopt, Foursquare and Gowalla? The face2face blog tells us:\n\nFace2face is about integrating where other apps are about piggybacking\u2026 we don\u2019t want to make you take time out from your life to check in, or build a new network from scratch. We want to enrich your life, not complicate it! So face2face weaves seamlessly into your existing social network, gives users maximum control over who sees their information, and \u2014 of course \u2014 doesn\u2019t screw with your privacy by mapping your exact location for the benefit of prying eyes.\n\nHameed Khan says that Proximate Global is pioneering the concept of \u201cproximity awareness\u201d \u2013 allowing users to enjoy the benefits of sharing with friends in their network when they\u2019re nearby, without divulging precise location. Privacy and Security are a primary concern.\n\nDuring a bloggers-only event at the Proximate Global office is Karachi, we were given handsets (iPhone, Blackberry and Android) with the latest versions of the app. We spent some time playing with it and I must say I found it to be a very \u201ccool\u201d application.\n\nAnd it seems I am not the only one who thought so. It is amazing the amount of coverage face2face has received locally and internationally. Well done guys! You do us proud.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Face2Face captures the imagination of local & international\u00a0media"},

We have young companies developing some great applications and it is always good to try and benchmark your products against those being developed elsewhere.\n\nSo I put up a blog post, put up links on Facebook and Twitter and sent out emails to all the mobile application development companies that I knew. People are generally so caught up in work that only 5 companies nominated their products. I told Osama that it was at least a beginning \u2013 and maybe next year we would start promoting the event a lot earlier so that there would be more entries.\n\nThe mBillionth secretariat at Digital Empowerment Foundation (http://defindia.net/), New Delhi reached out to all of South Asia region to solicit nominations across 10 categories: Business, Culture & Heritage, Education, Entertainment, Government, Health, Inclusion, Environment, News and Travel & Tourism.\n\nMore than 200 entries were received and after rigorous scrutiny 175 nominations were successfully accepted and presented to the 14 Jury members of which there were 5 from Pakistan.\n\nThe Grand Jury of the mBillionth South Asia Award 2010 comprised of 14 experts including Zaheer Alam Kidvai from Pakistan. They struggled for 3 days in Colombo from June 9 \u2013 13 to find 24 best practices across 10 categories hailing from 8 South Asian countries.\n\nThe winners for the mBillionth were announced at at the South Asia Mobile Congress, Exhibition & Award Gala yesterday July 23, 2010 in New Delhi. The Indian Minister for Rural Development was one of the VIPs at the event.\n\nThe great news is that of all the 200 entries that were submitted 2 of the 24 winners are from Pakistan:\n\nSee N Report won in the m-News & Journalism Category,\n\nCongratulations to Sharjeel Ahmed Qureshi, Adil Saleem, Yaser Awan and Dr. Umar Saif of See N Report and to Atif Mumtaz of UM Healthcare Trust and Dr. Arshad Ali DG of SEECS who are collaborating on the Jaroka project.\n\nI think it is extremely important for our companies to continue to benchmark what we create against ICT products being developed within Pakistan by participating in the P@SHA ICT Awards and other such activities, in South Asia through programs like the mBillionth Award and in the Asia Pacific through the APICTA Awards.

So when I walked into my brother\u2019s office in Hong Kong and saw this unusual item sitting on his desk, I was naturally filled with curiosity. I asked him what it was and he said \u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d. I couldn\u2019t guess. He turned it on and i could feel a cool breeze but couldn\u2019t see where it was coming from.\n\nI examined it, put my hand through it and said \u201cWell it seems to be a cooling device but how does it work?\u201d He pressed a switch and it started to swivel like a fan. It could also be tilted. Amazing!\n\nOn further probing, I was told it was a Dyson Multiplier fan. But it didn\u2019t look like a fan. For one thing there were no blades. But a fan it was indeed. According to the website, Dyson Air Multiplier\u2122 fans work differently from conventional fans. They use Air Multiplier\u2122 technology to draw in air and amplify it \u2013 from 15 to 18 times, depending on the model. With no blades or grille, they\u2019re safe and easy to clean. And they produce an uninterrupted stream of smooth air, with no unpleasant buffeting. Here is a review on the Dyson Air Multiplier on CNET. Sir James Dyson, the creator of this bladeless fan, explains how it works.\n\nSo gone are the days when a child\u2019s hand could be caught in a fan, or someone\u2019s long hair or dupatta. Here is the solution and a neat one.\n\nNaturally I had to have one right away. Since they aren\u2019t available off the shelf in Hong Kong, I had to grab the one my brother had. It wasn\u2019t easy believe me. My brother is generous but his staff put up a lot of resistance. This was a unique item. They hadn\u2019t had a chance to even look at it properly and here I was ready to run off with it. But run I did and it now holds a prominent position on my office table. Come check it out if you like. It is so cool. :)", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "What is this strange looking\u00a0item?"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/psha-launchpad-next-stop-karachi/", "text": "After the successful launch of the Lahore event, we were a little more relaxed that the Karachi one which was scheduled for the next day, would go off without a hitch. However, force of habit meant that I was there several hours before I had to be \u2013 just to see that everything was going according to plan. I had also scheduled a meeting at 12 noon with someone who was visiting Karachi from Lahore even though it was a Sunday so I had to be there early.\n\nEverything was under control. My team was already there and so were most of the volunteers. The backdrop was being put up and everything else was being done. Some minor changes needed to be made with the stage setting and the seating but things were under control otherwise.\n\nSo when Khurram arrived for our meeting, we went down to the Nadia Coffee shop at the Marriott to have our discussions over a cup of coffee. It was only when people started to arrive that I was summoned upstairs.\n\nThe judges in Karachi included:\n\n Amin Hashwani, director of the Hashoo Group\n\n Yusuf Jan, Founder of Mixit Inc & Chairman of P@SHA\n\n Ashraf Kapadia, MD, Systems Ltd\n\n Jawwad A. Farid, CEO, Alchemy Technologies\n\n Nauman Sheikh, Director, Credit Chex\n\n Rahim Lalani, Director, TRG Tech\n\nArziRehaish.pk, a web portal focusing on exclusively on bachelor accommodation. The theme of this portal was to facilitate bachelor community of Pakistan who travel from their home towns for educational and employment purposes.\n\nPeople Capital, an online human resource management software as a service (SaaS) model, through which organizations (SMEs) would have their own online Human Resource Development, Management and Information system, orientation and knowledge resource without the need for setting it up, maintaining it and worrying about hosting it.\n\nKitabain.com is Usman and Jawwad\u2019s latest initiative towards making books accessible to a wider audience in Pakistan. About a year ago they started out The Readers Club, Pakistan\u2019s first online book rental service in Karachi (www.thereadersclub.com). Very often they get requests from members for the option to purchase books that they\u2019d like to hold on to and also a way to give away books that might be lying around.\n\nThey have tried to put the two requests together along with other ideas to come up kitabain.com. They envision it as a platform to enable individual sellers or independent bookstores to instantly make their inventory available to a much wider audience than they can typically hope to with a geographically constrained brick and mortar establishment. For Buyers; Whether they are looking for the latest releases or something hard-to-find, the hope is that they can find it at drastically reduced prices on kitabain.com.\n\nA simple idea that immediately resonated with the judges.\n\nFoot Mouse: Basicly Ahsan had been thinking of some design Innovation in the Mouse for a long while and one day he thought why shouldn\u2019tt we use this mouse with our feet. Naturally he google searched for existingproducts and found 2 major Foot operating Mice worth around 12000 t o 30000 Pakistani rupees, none of them as simple as the one he had in mind. So he brainstormed with teachers, his brother and his friends and voila, the Foot Mouse.\n\nWhy a Foot Mouse? Well, Ahsan thinks it can be used by people with physical challenges, it can be used by gamers and by musicians. He gave a live demo of the product and judges actually examined it. Price is estimated at Rs. 700. One of the judges asked Ahsan what he would do if he got an order for 100,000 pieces tomorrow. How long would it take for him to deliver? Where would he get the money to buy materials, etc. Valid questions to get him thinking. Interestingly enough the judge also said that he was part of a large NGO initiative dealing with physically challenged individuals and he asked Ahsan to meet with him so that they could explore the idea of turning this into a commercial product and getting him his first big order. Yay!\n\nPak Polling \u2013 Ali Naqi says this is a better and more efficient way of National Elections Voting through an SMS based service and Finger Print Scanning alongwith Automated camera snapshot and Live camera monitoring of Voter on the day of Polling.\n\nRenSoy is the \u201cthe search assistant you need\u201d, says Adnan Muzaffar. The idea behind RenSoy is simple.\u00a0 We all use Google as a search engine. Why? Because we get relevant, reliable and accurate results quickly, with a simple GUI.\n\n However, Google has advanced searching capabilities through different commands. But only the smartest people or the IT/Tech related people know how to use them effectively.\n\nThat\u2019s where RenSoy comes into play. It offers web, image, blog, news and books search all in one place \u2013 and all of the searches are legally powered by Google. So quality is assured, its fast, ajaxified and has 30 different ways of searching and the GUI is sleek and simple.\n\nReflex 360 \u2013 A research house that would be a setup, foundation or a unit where IT personals, IT-base companies and educational institutes will come together under the umbrella of \u2018research work\u2019. This research work for example could be based on discovering new technologies ( write down your technical wordy stuff here). On financial front and to sustain it, Reflex 360 could sell out newly discovered ideas and prototypes to interested companies. It could even invoke foreign investment in aspect of off-shoring research material. It would help give a culture of \u2018research\u2019 a base in the country. People with vague ideas and concepts about \u2018the next big thing\u2019 could come together with people with IT- genius and research and develop it. The house would publish research papers, materials and develop piloting systems if the idea is worthy.\n\nWi-track \u2013 Taimoor Zubair says that this is a GSM/GPRS based tracking system which uses cellphones to track users. He says that it is a novel concept which provides an alternate to GPS based tracking and is much more flexible and cost-effective. The location of a user is determined by using nearby cellphone towers and applying the principle of triangu lation. This location information can be sent in real-time to the server using GPRS or sms.\n\nSEO tool \u2013 Sadia Abdullah said that their tool provides optimization services to increase web page ranking on search engines especially Google. It performs Keyword Analysis and will suggest appropriate keywords with respect to pages. It determines Site Popularity and analyzes HTML Code for better optimization\n\n and generates reports. They are planning to offer SEO outsourcing services to customers domestically and internationally.\n\nDhaaba, says Ali Iqbal Khan, is the first implementation of a \u2018data-aggregation\u2019 idea of Enroi. Basically it will enable consumers to order food online or through SMS. Right now it is not possible to order food online, consumers need to remember the phone number and make a call. Few restaurants have their websites and they are seldom well-maintained. Dhaaba is envisioned to fill this gap.\n\n Features:\n\n -Portal with data aggregation from restaurants\n\n -Consumer can view/search/compare dishes of various restaurants at one place\n\n -Consumers make order through website or SMS\n\n -Dhaaba will communicate order to particular restaurant and food will be delivered to consumer\n\n -Consumers don\u2019t need to enter address details etc. as Dhaaba will save them.\n\n -Consumers can save their whole week\u2019s lunch plan, Dhaaba will make order appropriately on each day.\n\n -Consumers\u2019 money and time will be saved for making an order.\n\nInteractive Learning for the Muslim world \u2013 To provide an online platform for students all over the world, especially Pakistan, where they can learn and play at the same time.\u00a0 Apart from conventional classroom learning, children will now be able to enhance their creative and interpersonal skills on an online forum.\u00a0 It would play a role of discussion board for students, teachers and parents. Online lessons, exercises, modules, chapters and one to one sessions on all subjects will be provided 24/7.\u00a0 Because of this imitative, students will get out of the typical home tuition and academy system.\n\nFYDest \u2013 The idea is to guide the people by telling them the shortest path to their destination. It is the same function provided by the GPS in cars. GPS can tell you to turn right or left to rea ch to your destination. Our idea is a little bit different. In addition to the service similar to GPS we want to provide additional information to the user. We inform the user that from all possible paths, which is the easiest, shortest and fastest. These goals can be achieved by giving the user the current situation of the path that he is going to take. Or at least inform the user the fastest path after analysis of all the possible ones.\n\nFormal Shirts Online \u2013 Shahzeb Saeed brings together handpicked fabrics, light but durable, and meticulous tailoring in order to deliver the very best to you. The carefully proportioned collars, made of 18 individual pieces, are reinforced by removable collar bones to ensure durability and edge bones to maintain shape. Plackets help strengthen the cuffs and hide the wrists. The shoulder fit is perfect every single time, because of the use of a two piece split yoke at the back. The details matter here, and extra care is taken in the hand-stitching and finishing so that you never have to worry about your shirts, ever again. He is running this business online and has achieved some level of success already.\n\nPakiPay \u2013 Ahsan Saleem sais that PakiPay is a small tool for bridging the Pakistan mobile world to the internet, by allowing users to share mobile balance to purchase small value items via the internet or phone. It currently works only in Pakistan. There was some discussion as to whether PakiPay would require a license from the State Bank of Pakistan as has been the experience of products like Amaana and Innovate.\n\nTelecom Clicking GE \u2013 a web based application that binds the tools of Mapinfo into Google Earth, with facility to view\u00a0 3D plots of sites. Mapinfo is the most widely used software in telecom. It plots the sites of the network in its window and has tools that display the frequencies assigned to the cells of site, and the adjacencies (neighbors for Handovers) created in the database. This allows the engineers to plan and audit the Radio Network of cellular systems. They also use\u00a0 Google Earth for updated geographical info. As Mapinfo tools for displaying frequency/adjacency are not portable in GE, the engineer constantly switches between Mapinfo & GE. Telecom Clicking GE integrates the benefits of desktop application Mapinfo into web application Google Earth, while resolving the problems in usage of Mapinfo. The product displays height of site, hence allowing faster & efficient plan and audit of Cellular Network.\n\nHelp Me \u2013 According to Farzal Dojki, H.ELP.ME is focused at providing technology support \u2013 pre launch but mostly post launch \u2013 for technology products, primarily, mobile applications. HELPME staff is trained by product owners, and then the consumer support interactions are migrated to be handled by HELP ME staff. The expected client base is supposed to be small product companies with < 20 people and needing between 0.5 to 5 people in support role \u2013 and hence the necessity to outsource instead of building in-house team and managing it. Farzal was looking for ideas on how to scale his business. The judges were impressed with the niche he had selected and saw impressive growth. They felt that he needed to tap into networks of individuals whom he had studied with, worked with in different industry segments and people he had had as mentors. Those would be the ideal channels in addition to the referrals from satisfied customers.\n\nKidsconvent.com \u2013 Kidsconvent.com is Pakistan\u2019s first customizable online/offline animated syllabus with Urdu Script. It supports and wants to promote activity based learning methodology of education. According to Ahmad Raza, animation and graffiti can help a child to capture & understand concepts more quickly than a regular notebook. Their idea is not to make the book obsolete, but to use animated syllabus as a supporting tool.\n\nTagit \u2013 This service attempts to create an easy way to communicate with your consumer in three simple steps:\n\n 1. Brand/ Blog/Organization visits the Tagit website and registers itself and receives a unique ID similar to brand name or a simple widget to integrate into their website.\n\n 2. Brand/ Blog/Organization asks their consumers to SMS their uniqueID to the given mobile short code for example \u201cSMS Microsoft to 3456\u201d.\n\n 3.\u00a0 If the consumer texted Microsoft to 3456, Microsoft and the consumer are now connected, consumer can send any message to Microsoft by simply texting to 3456, and Microsoft can send notifications, updates to connected consumers.\n\n Websites or blogs can integrate a simple widget on their homepage through which a reader can subscribe to their RSS feeds which he/ she will receive through SMS.\n\n Internet users can interact with the brands through Tagit\u2019s Brand Social Network by simply joining/ following the brand pages to get their latest updates. Possibilities are endless and the solution is simple.\n\nThe winning entries in Karachi included Kitabain.com for the product category whereas the winner for the idea category was a tie between Foot Mouse and Tagit. What was more satisfying was that in addition to the cheques, the winners had additional offers of assistance and collaboration. Khurram of Evolve offered to connect Usman Siddiqui of Kitabain with some of the main bookstore chains in Lahore and Tagit has signed a termsheet with a local technology company to work jointly on developing the product.\n\nThe participants were all pleased with the questions and feedback that they received from the judges but some people in the audience felt that the judges were very tough on the presenters. However, as one judge pointed out, \u201cWe wanted to be tough on them now because the opportunity cost of changing direction is low. We want to prevent them from the kind of heartache that we went through at a later stage on our entrepreneurial journey.\u201d So there were questions like:\n\nHave you had any user feedback vis-a-vis the utility of the product and the UI?\n\nOkay so it is cool, but have you done some research on existing competitors and pricing?\n\nWho is the customer? What will he pay for the product? What problem does it solve?\n\nHow will you market the product or service? How will you grow the business?\n\nHow is this different from what already exists in the market? How is it innovative?\n\nSome of the kids made the mistake of using a significant portion of their time \u201ceducating\u201d the judges regarding the internet or technology in general or about education. This cut into their presentation time and they were unable to talk about the innovation, the impact and the business viability of the product or service. However, some of the presentations were very good and it was generally a good start to the kind of activity that is needed to generate more and more ideas, and increasingly the setting up of new and successful businesses in the IT space.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "P@SHA LaunchPad: the Karachi\u00a0event"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/a-good-beginning-to-the-psha-launchpad-activities/", "text": "Planning any event is both an exciting and arduous task and when you are limited by time and resources, you sometimes wonder why you took it on at all (here is a picture of me praying that all goes well).\n\nStanding in the Dome Room of the Royal Palm Golf Club and Resort in Lahore surrounded by 200+ excited young people on a Saturday afternoon, I had my answer. This was why. I was in a room full of talented and motivated young people. The energy was electrifying. It was these young people with their ideas, their passion and their commitment to excel that made it all worthwhile.\n\nThe volunteers (spearheaded and led by Rafaeel Akbar Chaudhry) had been there for hours. There wasn\u2019t really that much to take care of but whatever needed to be done, they had taken care of it. This included having the backdrop and banners put up, lining up the presenters, copying and testing the presentations on one laptop to save time, preparing the badges, testing the connectivity so that tweeting would be possible, making sure the scoring sheets were ready for the judges, that the microphones and multimedia projector were working, that the huge cheques were placed in an accessible spot \u2013 in fact all the nitty gritty that goes into event management. All I had to do was hang about worrying for no reason at all until people started arriving. Rafaeel and I even had time to compare the Apple iPad and the Chinese made iPed. Not surprisingly there is no comparison between the two. The iPad is far superior! :D\n\nI met a lot of old friends and made some new ones. Once the judges showed up we huddled and went through the score sheet discussing the criteria, the number of entries, time allotted etc. The judging panel included luminaries like:\n\nZia Imran, MD, PSEB\n\n Zafar Khan, Founder of Sofizar Constellation\n\n Dr. Umar Saif, Founder, Saif Center for Innovation\n\n Ibrahim Qureshi, Director of Raffles\n\n Nadeem Aslam Malik, VP Strategy & Business Development, Infotech\n\n Badar Khushnood, Country Consultant, Google\n\nA very high-powered panel indeed and their commitment to entrepreneurship in Pakistan was obvious from the fact that they had committed to being there for the next 5 hours assessing ideas and providing feedback.\n\nI started with a very brief intro as to the whys and whereofs of the event and naturally mentioned the sponsor organizations PSEB, Microsoft and Sofizar Constellation who had made the event possible through their generous sponsorships. I also mentioned the CIO Pakistan team who was not present at the Lahore event but had provided online support by promoting the event.\n\nThe list of ideas and products presented included:\n\nMax99 \u2013 a Chatroom oriented platform with some interesting Business Models. A\u00a0 connected experience by aggregating various features like Unlimited Chat Rooms, MultiKicking Game Rooms, Private Chat, Color chat, Translation Bots, Voice Messages, Offline Messages, Flood Control,\u00a0 Social Networking, Photo Sharing, Presence Based Messenger and strong Security Features.\n\nVcred.com \u2013 VCred is a unique web-based service that enables organizations to make smarter and more cost-effective decisions through instant online verification of educational qualification, employment history and references.\n\nFaceXS \u2013 a 3D Face Recognition device that uses advanced technology capable of identification and verification of human Faces in less than a second and addresses all the problems that are associated with much hyped fingerprint and hand geometry systems. It even works with dirty and wet faces!\n\nExam Master \u2013 A web based application developed in .Net 2.0 Framework with C# as development language and MS SQL SERVER 2005 as database.\n\n It separates Login and Control Panels for instructors and students. There is a Randomization of the algorithm to ensure the shuffling of questions, an Online Timer and number of questions prescribed by the teacher.\u00a0 It is biometric enabled and there is a maintenance of the performance history and exam continuity in case of power failure.\n\nBudEx \u2013 This group creates Web, mobile and Facebook applications that are primarily focused on solving everyday trivial problems. The idea they presented at the LaunchPad event was a recent Facebook app that they launched \u201cBudEx\u201d which\u00a0 is a friends based parc el delivery service that uses social media for its purpose.\n\nGreen \u2013 a concept of packaging multiple solutions in one mobile application compatible with all kinds of mobiles developed in the MXIM Framework. Its biggest strength lies in its flexibility to customize itself with the personal needs and requirements of each and every type of individual. Green is an application ledge offering different mobile applications to use from. It also has the capability of upgrading itself without the manual download of a newer version of same application every time. Any new application can be added to the ledge and it will appear in the user\u2019s mobile without any hassle.\n\nFindnumber \u2013 When you change your mobile/home/office number, get it updated on findnumber. Now if someone needs to find your new number, they can enter your old number on findnumber and they will get your new number. Not only that they can also register on the site and share their new contact numbers with their friends, colleagues, etc. You can use settings to customize who can/cannot have access to your new number.\n\nSchoolGuide.pk \u2013 A web based application that allows parents to search for schools in Pakistan, read and write reviews and interact with other parents via question and answers, stories and advice, and school groups.\n\nPakReviews \u2013 Are you looking for the perfect dress for your cousin\u2019s wedding but don\u2019t know where to go? Do you want to hire the services of a professional photographer but aren\u2019t sure which one to contact? Do you want to impress your in-laws by taking them to some fancy restaurant but are confused when it comes to deciding which one? Or do you simply want people to hear you out? If such is the case, then the creators of PakReviews says that it is the place to be! At PakReviews, you can find reviews on just about anything pertaining to Pakistan; be it fashion, education, business or entertainment.\n\nHozaa \u2013\u00a0 a group of computer vision researchers, enthusiasts, and professionals who share the common goal of developing next generation products that have automated understanding of visual content (images and videos) as their core building block. Hozaa, which is video search engine in the works, is a step in that direction. Hozaa makes large video repositories searchable by recognizing unlimited number of objects, concepts, and events in videos and by generating appropriate content specific textual tags that could be used for search purposes within existing text based search infrastructure.\n\nnaqshaBiz \u2013 a very powerful visualization tool, which uses Microsoft\u2019s Bing Maps Silverlight Control enabling organizations to see patterns that would be otherwise invisible. It is often very difficult to \u2018see\u2019 patterns in a typical organizational database, but relatively easy to see patterns and relationships in maps and other graphical material. naqshaBiz makes it possible to\u00a0 visualize\u00a0 demand and supply separately as well as\u00a0 together. . Such spatial and GIS analysis and databases provide visual results with countless business and operational applications.\n\nCyberLancing \u2013 Freelancing portal in which the buyers will be from all over the world but the providers will be just from Pakistan.\n\nhttp://teebuzz.designers99.com/\n\n A garments designer application and initially the scope of which is custom design tshirts that people wear. Unlike the conventional way of buying, you can change the color of your tshirt, draw graphics on it, put your own custom text before you can actually buy the customized tshirt. This idea has already been initiated by a few service providers in US market but this is absolutely new in our local market.\u00a0 We have seen a few shirts done is custom fashion, but no one is offering this service to those who will wear these shirts eventually.\u00a0 Additionally, we want to compete US service providers by equipping our designer with easy to use garments designing tools. It would be a designing portal where not only people will design their tshirts, but they can also design dress shir ts, ties, hoodies and their suitings in next phase.\n\nNibula \u2013 a web platform that connects organisers, attendees and sponsors while enabling organisers to create a network for their group, society or chapter and maintain events. It\u2019ll be a one stop platform to subscribe events related to any field of life and share them with friends and colleagues at school with a built-in module to sell tickets. The organisers can see who the attendees are and what they are saying about it. Nibula is unique because it provides organisers with tools to create full featured event portal, with ability to sell tickets instantly though web and mobile app. The service will get the leverage of existing UGC sites like Facebook and twitter to share the events.\n\nCost per Acquisition (CPA) or Cost per Sale (CPS) marketing is emerging very fast in Western world and in Pakistan it\u2019s yet to be introduced. Behind the CPA technique its very simple formula i.e. Credit will only be given to selling party when they generates any action (sale). We would be providing a state of the art platform to keep track of the progress for both Advertiser (Sales) & Web Master (Earnings).\n\nThe youngsters did a great job in presenting their ideas and products. The ideas that generated a lot of discussion included Hozaa (the winner in the Idea category). Several of the judges felt that if they delivered on the promise of the idea, it could be a billion dollar idea out of Pakistan. The challenges were however great and they needed to work on addressing them. A couple of the judges offered their assistance in brainstorming the idea that is already on its way toward beta. Not surprising therefore that Babar Khan who presented the idea walked away with one of the cheques!\n\nAnother idea that generated a lot of excitement was the SchoolGuide.pk presentation by Ahmer Mumtaz. He clearly said that they were not looking for investment; just ideas. And that is what Ahmer got. Judges felt that the product was well developed and that it had a lot of merit. Several of them said that if something like that had existed when they were looking for schools for their kids, they would have used it for sure. Suggestions were made on how to extend the idea to generate more interest and make it a revenue earner.\n\nFarhan Masood made a very slick presentation of his product FaceXS which is still a startup although the product has been bought and is being tried by various industry segments in Pakistan. A hardware-software solution, it was judged to be a very sophisticated and extremely affordable solution that could be marketed locally and internationally. Farhan walked off with the cheque for the best product pitched.\n\nWhat was also exciting about the event was the live tweeting that was taking place from the venue with feedback coming in from people who were not in Lahore or not present at the venue. Great job done by the Tweeples.\n\nThe networking that followed was of great value as many of the youngsters surrounded the judges and other experienced professionals, firing questions at them and asking for advice. Overall a very satisfying event that ended with some of the youngsters wanting to know when the next one was :).", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "A good beginning to the P@SHA LaunchPad\u00a0activities"},

I am happy to say that they were wrong.\n\nThe Dome room at the Royal Palm Country Club & Resort was full of energy, full of mostly young people who were there either to present or to watch and listen to the ideas being presented. Granted some of the presentations could have been more focused but the fact that people were thinking and creating and looking at opportunities that were out there, was in itself good to see.\n\nIn my book they were all stars \u2013 the nominees, the winners, the judges, the guys who tweeted the whole event live and all the participants and we must not forget the volunteers and the sponsors who made it all possible. Thanks everyone. It was a pleasure being in Lahore, it was amazing meeting many of you and talking about things affecting you, your businesses and the country.\n\nThe judges were absolutely amazing \u2013 their tough questions, their blunt comments, their suggestions and advice were a learning in themselves. A number of young people came to me afterward and said that this was more than they had learnt in 4 years of university. This was real life learning. So true.\n\nDetails, photos and videos will be uploaded in the coming days.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/06/12/creating-our-first-digital-stories-as-part-of-the-ftx/", "text": "I know it is not a very difficult task to create a digital story (especially with the kind of easy-to-use software that is available today) but the process of creating a story that is personal to you can be extremely stressful and can take a lot out of you. Remember also that for many of the women who took part in the FTX, this was a first.\n\nHere is what the process involved:\n\nThe story circle took the most out of the majority of the participants as they reached into the deepest recesses of their soul to pull out a personal story. This element of the workshop took the longest time as well.\n\nOnce the stories poured out, full of emotion and accompanied often by tears and heartbreak, the facilitators broke them into parts so that they could help us all to put a story idea together with some clarity and focus. Once this was done we had to write our scripts. It is one thing to break down and ramble on about something that hurts you to the core. It is another to take a step back, look at what happened and clearly put the words down so that it can be developed into something you can share with others.\n\nAs the ladies (and our one male feminist) tried to put words down on screen, we realized that as we worked, what we were actually doing was starting the healing process.\n\nThe next step was to record the narration once Jan or Jenny or Val had looked at the scripts and told us if there were any amendments that were needed. We had been taught Audacity by Cheekay so we knew how to record, remove noise, increase the volume and edit the narration if necessary.\n\nWith the narration completed, it was time to visualize the story. This was tougher than one had imagined. Whether it was one\u2019s own story or a story about someone else in which one was present. you had to be careful about who you depicted, whether to use visuals but annonymize them, whether to use sketches instead or to find abstract photos that would serve the purpose.\n\nOnce the visuals were found and worked on using open source manipulation software, it was time to merge the narration, the visuals and add the music and the transitions so that it became a story. We had been given a tutorial in both MovieMaker (for Windows) and iMovie (for Mac) so that we could put our digital stories together. Easier said than done of course. Some of us found we had too many visuals, others found there weren\u2019t enough, syncing the narration with the right visuals was a challenge too. And we had a deadline to work with. Yikes! Tough facilitators wanted it done in time so that there could be a screening on the fourth day :). It didn\u2019t help that everyone was trying to be a perfectionist, wanted their stories depicted just so!\n\nThere was frustration, there were cries for help and poor Jamal, the facilitators and some of us were called upon to assist at various stages of the exercise as data disappeared from laptops and the Movie making apps did all sorts of weird things.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that the internet connectivity was slow and intermittent and that the airconditioning played havoc with our lives. Headphones were broken and some laptops faced static issues.\n\nWe had been told that we should only use open source or licensed software and copyright-free images if we wanted to distribute the stories later or use them for training purposes. Certain websites were identified where copyright images and sounds were available.\n\nIt is not surprising that many of us worked through the night in order to finish our digital stories, and even then we weren\u2019t really satisfied with them. We wished we had had more time, that we were better illustrators, better photographers, better script writers and narrators, better at putting together a movie.\n\nBut when the time finally came for the screening of the Digital Stories we had created, we realized that we had unnecessarily been too hard on ourselves.\n\nAs I viewed movie after movie, I was amazed at the way each story had been crafted. The sensitivity and the pain came through each story as did the courage of each of the women whose stories we saw and heard. The talent and technique, the artistry, the ability to put into words something so personal, so deep, so heartbreaking at times that all you wanted to do was go and hug the storyteller.\n\nI think our facilitators were as surprised as we were at what we had accomplished in three days. As I watched them watching the visualization of the stories they had heard that first day, I saw some of the expressions \u2013 the empathy, the amazement, the pride and the joy of seeing the result of the process that they had started only a few days earlier.\n\nEntry filed under: Posts.

Although I was confident that most of the participants that we had nominated for the first Train the Trainer program of the MDG3 Feminist Tech Exchange were confident, dedicated, talented, hardworking, fun-loving individuals with a strong commitment to making a difference to the society and the community, I wasn\u2019t really sure what the take-away from this first workshop would be.\n\nHaving attended zillions of conferences, seminars and workshops over the years, I am very often put off by the format of such things. There are facilitators or speakers who, through those much-dreaded Powerpoints, tell us how much they know, how much they have achieved and what we should do to join the ranks of the successful and be more like them.\n\nFortunately for us, the FTX facilitators turned out to be pleasantly very different. Jan, Jenny, Val and Cheekay have put a structure to the workshop no doubt, but the space has been very much ours. From the get-go participants have been encouraged to share, to create and to be a part of the proceedings.\n\nIt started with the three videos that we were shown. They showed each of us how a simple but impactful message could be created using very basic tools. It didn\u2019t require one to be a creative genius or a nerd.\n\nThe story circles were powerful and totally unexpected. The sharing of experiences (our own or those in which we played a central role) revealed much more than any of us had really expected. The struggle, the abuse, the violence, the challenges and the eventual strength, confidence, success and empowerment that resulted from not letting the circumstances engulf us but deciding to survive instead and go on to empower others, was a message that came clearly through.\n\nSure there were tears as many talked about very personal experiences for the very first time but it resulted in catharsis of a sort although it was unbelievably draining. I think that the sharing of the stories and experiences created a bond between most of the participants. It also showed them that they were not alone, that things happened which were sometimes totally out of their control. It also spelt out quite clearly the many varied societal issues that exist and how some have managed to not only survive them but have got stronger because of it, and are now prepared to help others avoid similar challenges and issues.\n\nMore later.

We all were. However, I don\u2019t think any of us could have foreseen how inspiring and powerful the first day of the workshop would be.\n\nA quick look at the FTX Website tells us that:\n\nThe Feminist Tech Exchange, also known as the FTX, was developed in response to calls from feminist and women\u2019s rights movements for greater understanding of emerging technologies, their potential and impact on the rights and lives of women. Through skills sharing, information exchange and discussions, the FTX explores feminist practices and politics of technology, and raises awareness on the critical role of communication rights in the struggle to advance women\u2019s rights worldwide.\n\nThe FTX-es also aim to create a connection between ICT and the empowerment of women, for women to take control of technology and use it for their own benefit and for the benefit of the communities and societies in which they live.\n\nThe first ever such workshop in Pakistan started in Islamabad yesterday. It was a day I will not soon forget. Digital Story Telling, Online Security and Online Advocacy skills are all very much part of the agenda of this 5 day workshop. In this video, Jan Moolman, the Global Coordinator for the MDG3 project who is an expert from South Africa and a core member of the APC, told us the importance of Digital Stories and read out some prose that explained why people wrote what they did (and why they told the stories that they did).

Or is he an animator/producer?\u00a0 An Islamic economist? Or perhaps an entrepreneur? Or maybe he is all these rolled into one. Shehryar was in Karachi speaking at a Mobile Applications & Animation event organized by P@SHA and PSEB. It was a great opportunity to get him into the CIO Webstudio for a chat on ITLoW.\n\nA couple of key points that came out during the talk were:\n\n1. Telecom companies and multinationals don\u2019t want to take a risk in trying something new, something cutting edge, something that no-one has done before in Pakistan. They would rather stick to their comfort zone and bet only on tried and tested techniques and campaigns.\n\n2. You don\u2019t need a degree to be an artist. You just need the opportunity to explore, to learn, to be exposed to the best from around the world. All this is possible and available via the internet to anyone sitting anywhere in Pakistan. The story of the young man from Peshawar who was thrown out of school because the curriculum did not interest him and he preferred to draw and sketch \u2013 was hence seen to be a failure who would amount to nothing \u2013 should ring alarm bells about an education system that is ready to give up on the talent that exists in this country. He was lucky that he had access to his boss\u2019s graphic tablet for two hours and created something that caught the eye of the team at Trango Interactive, and he is now a successful 3D artist and designer who has outgrown them.\n\n3. \u2018Someone\u2019 (the government, rich private sector organizations) need to do small things to push the animation industry forward in order for it to reach its true potential. As Shehryar suggests, perhaps giving a bunch of companies Rs. 500,000 \u2013 Rs. 1,000,000 each to develop localized games, might be one option. PTA, PSEB, USF or the National ICT R&D Fund could do that quite easily. After all, before Captain Safeguard was launched, no-one even looked at creating or using a local super hero. That led to the creation of the demand for a lot more comapanies turning to 3D animation for their advertising.\n\nWe should not allow another Shera Jutt type game be put on the shelf. It might not be your type of character or game but it could lead to other innovative local content with local heroes from South Asian culture and history speaking and singing in local languages. Or will we forever continue to absorb only content created by others for our consumption?\n\nShehryar Hydri had a lot more to say but it would be better if you go watch the interview rather than read a transcription of the entire thing on my blog.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "A conversation with Shehryar Hydri \u2013 COO of Trango\u00a0Interactive"},

Fazal, who is a driver, picked me up from Benazir Bhutto International Airport, Islamabad on Wednesday evening. On the way to the Guest House we had a very intense conversation on everything from politics to education to healthcare and, believe it or not, street protests.\n\nAmongst other things, Fazal asked me why it was that:\n\n1. Other countries have at least some sincere political leaders who have led their nations to great heights when we have not had a single leader, since 1948 to date, who has come to office without a personal agenda, someone who simply wanted to help this country reach it\u2019s true potential. Did we really deserve this fate, he wanted to know. We are good people who work hard to make an honest living. We love this country and continue to have high hopes for it, he said. When will those hopes be realized?\n\n2. Protests take place in every country, said Fazal, and people should have the right to voice their opinion. However, he had seen that when people protested in most other countries, most of them did so in a disciplined way. Even when there were hundreds of thousands of them they stuck to the route that was assigned to them, they didn\u2019t destroy property or resort to violence or intimidation. Why was it, he asked, that 9 times out of 10, when we went out onto the streets especially under the auspices of political parties, we ended up causing chaos and damaging public property? When will we learn, he asked, that we only hurt ourselves when we burnt vehicles and shops.\n\n3. A good education, sufficient food to sustain oneself and healthcare when it was needed, was the right of the citizens of every State, said this amazing man. He said that he knew that not all States were able to provide all these benefits to all their citizens but at least one could see that they were making an effort. Why, asked Fazal, did our leaders not even try to fulfill these needs for the average Pakistani? They were so busy scoring points off each other and filling their own pockets that they didn\u2019t even see the hopes and aspirations with which their electorate looked toward them?\n\nI was speechless \u2013 didn\u2019t quite know what to say to him. Here was a man without the benefits of an education who had just voiced the thoughts that go through the minds of many of us often. I wanted to say something to reassure him but I couldn\u2019t. All I could do was agree with him and wish that someone like Fazal could be voted to office and given all the support he needed. With his wisdom, his integrity and his sincerity, we could possibly embark on the right path. Despite all these questions that went through his mind, Fazal still managed to be optimistic and confident that one day things would improve. God keep you safe Fazal and may you see a change in your lifetime.\n\n\u2013 Posted using BlogPress from my iPad", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Why can\u2019t we learn from this\u00a0man?"},

Have any of you noticed how slow the internet has been the past week? And how many times the connection has dropped? Some ISPs have been worse affected than others.\n\nWorking in the cloud has certainly been slow of late. Reminds me of the days when we used dialup connections. If you are wondering why we are facing these service issues, wonder no more!\n\nWhen internet monitoring & surveillance takes place and when content filtering is being done, service can depreciate anywhere from between 10 \u2013 75% \u2013 usually at least 35%.\n\nNo I am not making this up. There has been a debate going on in Australia where the government is spending A$42 billion on improving and expanding the broadband infrastructure because they realize that broad internet access is going to be essential for E-Learning, E-Health, E-Government and E-Business and to assist in the further development and growth of the economy.\n\nThe debate has been surrounding content filtering and if under the current security situation around the world, one should buy/develop content filtering and monitoring software and hardware solutions. Researchers and technologists have warned that if filtering and monitoring is built in, it will slow down the overall Internet experience by as much as 75% thus hurting the Australian economy.\n\nHas our government even thought about this? As it is, service levels are not that amazing and work often takes longer than it should. If filtering and surveillance becomes a trend, we have to worry about declining service levels. In addition to a lack of access to hundreds of sites, even the ones we can access take forever to load, thus impacting on the user experience.\u00a0 I hope the powers that be will wake up to the fact that the actions being taken are only hurting Pakistanis and the Pakistani economy.

Do we speak up against it in a civilized fashion like:\n\n\u2013 Writing blog posts and opinion pieces in mainstream media\n\n \u2013 Signing a petition\n\n \u2013 Pursuing Facebook and asking them to take down the page because it is offensive\n\n \u2013 Writing to our parliamentarians and asking that the government officially protest\n\n \u2013 Protesting using all sorts of media\n\nNo of course not (well some of us do, but most of us don\u2019t). Why would we do something as sensible as that, and have our voices heard? Instead we do what people have come to expect from us. We stifle our own voices by banning a social networking site where 2.5 million Pakistani could have been heard. We hide our head in the sand like ostriches. We react like little children do \u2013 closing our eyes and pretending that if we don\u2019t see it, it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nHow does that affect the \u2018offensive\u2019 page? It doesn\u2019t. They go on to do exactly what they were doing \u2013 and now there are no voices of protest on Facebook from Pakistan because we can\u2019t access Facebook in Pakistan. How ridiculous is that?\n\nWhen I tweeted about this yesterday, some young people angrily wrote back asking why I could not live without Facebook for a cause as important as this? That, my friends, is not the point. The question is not whether I can live without Facebook. The question is why should someone else \u2013 court or government \u2013 have the right to make a decision regarding what I can or cannot access online? Why should I allow my freedom to be compromised because some idiot somewhere has decided to push our buttons by starting a competition such as this?

There are also fears of employee and customer poaching (although, in my opinion, that is more likely to happen if you are not collaborating).\n\nWell it seems that finally things are beginning to to change, and it warms my heart to see it happening. Many more companies are now working on projects together not only domestically but also internationally; project referrals have also become commonplace whereby if a company is not working in a particular domain or have their hands full, they are now referring other firms who they know are capable of delivering on the project.\n\nKnowledge sharing, too, is catching on \u2013 companies and individuals who have been successful in a certain market or vertical, are sharing what they have learnt with colleagues and friends in the industry.

I remember teachers who seemed to be on a mission, a sort of crusade to educate, who wanted kids to open their minds to the possibilities around them. They were our counsellors, our mentors, the ones who guided us and listened to our sometimes extremely ridiculous ideas.\n\nThey encouraged us and never told us there was anything we couldn\u2019t do. They earned our respect because of their passion for teaching, for the values they inculcated and for the integrity with which they conducted themselves. Were they a different breed? Aren\u2019t there teachers like that anymore? A few of my friends have dedicated their lives to teaching, to illuminating the lives of children who were or are under their care. But I don\u2019t know if there are many others like them out there. Teaching appears to have turned into just another profession.\n\nEducation has become a business \u2013 not that \u2018business\u2019 is a bad word. It is just that schools and universities have become such commercial enterprises that everything is measured in terms of profits. There is a professor who told me the other day that he used to teach two courses at university and that was tough enough and left just enough time for him to dedicate to some of the research work that really interested him. He also had teaching assistants who helped him with assignments.\n\nNow the same professor teaches 3 courses, has no time for research and the teaching assistants position no longer assists. When he asked the management of the university where he works how he was supposed to teach so many courses and check assignments and projects all on his own, yet maintain the quality of the teaching he imparts, he was told that he could do away with the assignments (as we all know it is the project work that actually brings concepts to life and allows kids to experiment with innovative ideas). His objections to this suggestion were totally ignored.\n\nThat is the story that one hears at several universities in the country \u2013 that although fee structures are high and universities are very profitable, they do not want to invest in adding on more professors and teaching assistants. Instead they want to retain more and more of the profit. Is it any wonder then that the quality of education is not what it used to be a few years ago? Is there a way out of this situation?

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/insult-to-injury-first-no-paypal-now-no-payoneer/", "text": "We have been holding a discourse for quite a while about Paypal not including Pakistan on the list of countries in which they operate. They operate in 189 countries of the world. The only ones they don\u2019t operate in are Cuba, Pakistan, Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan and Syria. This post from Faisal Khan provides the details. We have been trying to find out why this is so. Several people have tried to get an answer from Paypal, we have also tried to find out from the US Department of Commerce if there is any US regulation that is stopping Paypal from offering its services in Pakistan. As the efforts continue to bring Paypal here, insult has been added to injury as freelancers and small companies using Payoneer cards very recently received this message: Due to a change in requirements from our regulators, as of June 1, 2010 Payoneer cards will be blocked for transactions in the countries listed by the US government as having strategic Anti Money Laundering (AML) deficiencies. This change will affect card usage in the following countries: Angola, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Sao Tome and Principe. If your card is in use in one of the countries listed, we encourage you to use all funds by May 31, while transactions are still possible in these countries. Please note that beyond May 31 your card will continue to be fully functional in all countries not banned by the US government, and we will be happy to load payments to the card without any change. We apologize for the inconvenience and hope that the Payoneer card will continue to provide you with valuable service. This means that all the freelancers and small businesses from Pakistan who used oDesk, Elance.com, Freelancer.com, RentaCoder, guru.com (there are many such individuals and companies who have been providing quality services to customers around the world through these sites) suddenly find themselves without a payment mechanism.\n\nSome of the youngsters who have been affected wrote to me and asked if I could help. I know they are not members of P@SHA but they are part of the technology community (and this will affect more than just technology providers \u2013 it will affect anyone that is using Payoneer as a service to do any kind of online business).\n\nSo why has this suddenly happened? Didn\u2019t we have an Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance in place? Of course we did \u2013 and that kept us off the list of high risk Money Laundering countries although everyone knew that we would only be taken off the list completely once we had a permanent law in place.\n\nAre the claims regarding the AML deficiencies\u00a0 that they mention in the message sent to providers valid?\n\nThe FATF welcomes Pakistan\u2019s efforts to ensure that its Anti-Money Laundering\n\n Ordinance (AMLO) remains in effect and to implement a permanent AML/CFT\n\n framework through legislation. However, FATF remains concerned regarding the\n\n ML/FT risks posed by Pakistan and reaffirms its public statement of 28 February 2008\n\n regarding these risks. In particular, the FATF expresses concern that Pakistan\u2019s Anti-\n\n Money Laundering Ordinance (AMLO) will expire on 26 March 2010. The FATF\n\n strongly urges Pakistan to implement a permanent AML/CFT framework before the\n\n expiration of the AMLO and strongly encourages Pakistan to establish a\n\n comprehensive AML/CFT framework. I am not sure how good or bad this Ordinance is. Advocate Nighat Dad tells us that The Asia Pacific Group on Financial Action Task Force (FATF), did not blacklist Pakistan but actually upgraded Pakistan\u2019s ranking from the list of high risk countries to the lowest risk countries or Category III. FATF had given Pakistan a February 2010 deadline for formal conversion of the ordinance into an Act of Parliament and it was expected that strict action might be taken against Pakistan, including dishonouring of letters of credit, if it failed to pass an Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Terrorist Financing Act. However, President \u00a0Zardari signed the approved legislation on Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act on 26, March 2010\u00a0 after getting approval from both houses of parliament. Here is the link to AML Act 2010 http://www.na.gov.pk/acts/act_2010/anti_money_laundering_act2010_260310.pdf The FATF is now scheduled to meet at Amsterdam in June 2010. In the meantime Nighat is going to have an indepth look at the Act because there appears to be concern in some quarters that parts of the Act have been amended and may infringe on Privacy, Human Rights and rights of businesses. Some parliamentarians actually suggested that the Act needs to be discussed again clause by clause. We are going to have Nighat and some other experts look at it before we comment any further on this. If anyone has suggestions for alternate payment mechanisms that these kids can use in the meantime, kindly let us know.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Insult to injury \u2013 first no Paypal; now no\u00a0Payoneer!"},

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/04/20/we-have-been-there-and-know-what-not-to-do/", "text": "Whenever one spends weeks and months planning an activity, it takes a toll because of the effort it involves. The Startup Insiders session at T2F on 14th April 2010, on the other hand, was put together in 36 hours. A blog post, Facebook, Twitter and a thread of emails were used to spread the word. Within 24 hours we had 45 registrants for the SI session on \u2018Business Models that work\u2019 which was co-organized by P@SHA and TiE Karachi. Usually if 45 people register,\u00a0 you expect to see around 30 which would have been okay with us because we wanted a good interactive group \u2013 not necessarily a large one. But imagine our surprise when around 75 people \u2013 mostly young and a few seasoned entrepreneurs \u2013 walked into T2F 2.0 for the session.\n\nThe panelists were an amazing group \u2013 Jawwad Ahmed Farid of Alchemy Technologies, Nauman Sheikh of Credit Chex, Adnan Agboatwalla of PixSense, Adnan Haider of Lootmaar.com and Imtiaz Mohammad of Inspire-x. From the get go they wasted no time in singing their own praises and talking about their achievements. They got straight into the business models that they had used at various enterprises which they had started that just hadn\u2019t worked and the lessons they had learnt from those mistakes.\n\nAdnan Haider started off by saying that whereas Imtiaz should be viewed as a new entrant into entrepreneurship, he was exiting and so while others on the panel might tell the participants what to do, he was going to tell them what not to do \u2013 because he had learnt it the hard way.\n\nNauman Sheikh revealed that he had started a company in the US during the dot com bubble when funding was easys to get; it went bust after which he decided to become an intrepreneur. What he suggested to would-be entrepreneurs who didn\u2019t have the money to invest in a venture, was to find a wealthy investor and go for work for him as an employee, ensuring that you were given 5-9% equity in the company and the products you helped it create. He said that is what he had been doing for the past few years. While he helped the investor become even wealthier, Nauman said he was leading a comfortable life.\n\nImtiaz advised that although ri sk is very much at the core of entrepreneurship, it was always best to ensure that one took a calculated risk and a reality check at various stages of the business.\n\nAdnan Agboatwalla started off by saying that in the almost 5 years of Pixsense\u2019s existence, the business model had changed five times, the last time as recently as last week (well, at least the new business model went live last week), and that is what he was going to focus on in his interaction.\n\nJawwad Ahmed Farid accepted that he had driven 3 companies into the ground in quick succession and didn\u2019t have a wealthy employer from whom he could take stock options. What he was there to deliver were some lessons he had learnt from the \u201cschool of hard knocks\u201d.\n\nSo that is how it all began. Some of the pieces of advice given by the panelists:\n\nAdnan Haider said that some of the mistakes they made at Lootmaar was to forget that there were two elements to look at \u2013 technology risk and market risk. He thinks that because they were a bunch of geeks, they spent too much on technology development \u2013 the auction engine, web 2.0, lots of other cool things but not enough time spent on market adoption. How fast was the\u00a0 market going to adopt the product and use it?\n\nThe second major mistake he thinks they made was to consider Lootmaar a part-time exercise. Adnan believes that if you are going into developing a serious venture, you can\u2019t moonlight, you can\u2019t keep your day job and do this. Maybe that is possible in the first month while you are developing your business plan or in the second month while you are developing a prototype but after that you need to give the project your total focus, your heart and soul.\n\n\u201cTo me, entrepreneurship is about what excites you, what you want to do, what kind of challenge you want to undertake, what problem you want to solve, to innovate.,\u201d said Nauman. He said that he wants to be an entrepreneur but he doesn\u2019t want to be bogged down with the administrative and operational tasks and if he has to hire people to do that, he would need money \u2013 quite a bit of money. \u201cSo my take on this is,\u201d said Nauman \u201cfind an entrepreneurial home, a 9-5 job where you can continue to innovate.\u201d He has been able to do that at Credit Chex where he has so far been responsible for the development of 8 out of the 9 products they have launched. He was responsible for coming up with the research and innovation for these products all of which now have real customers.\n\nImtiaz said it takes a bit of insanity to be an entrepreneur. He emphasized that one should only do what one loves to do. He said that for a startup, it is important to keep costs down \u2013 be lean and mean. A laptop, a cell phone, home-cooked food for yourself and any friends you may want to persuade to do difficult stuff for you and your home internet connection that someone else pays for is really all you need to begin with, says Imtiaz. Don\u2019t incur expenses you cannot afford at an early stage. Most entrepreneurs start ventures from their homes, their garages or whatever. Imtiaz has no designation on his card. He says he doesn\u2019t want one because he just wants to do the fun stuff which is to think, to strategize, to talk. He wants to get other people to do the difficult things \u2013 the coding, the presentations, the operations work.\n\nAdnan Agboatwalla first did a poll determining that the majority of the participants were either students or had been working for less than 3 years. 60% wanted to start companies but when he asked how many of them would quit their day jobs to do that, not one hand went up! So naturally Adnan\u2019s next question was \u201cHow come all of you want to become entreprenuers but none of you want to give up your day jobs?\u201d Some said they were still at University, others said they were scared of failing, yet others said they were afraid of the risk, that they either didn\u2019t have enough money, didn\u2019t think they had enough experience or the vision to start a venture, or that their families were against them taking this step.\n\nAdnan explained that the risks differ with age. When you are young, the risk is that you probably don\u2019t have the experience to run a venture and you spend your own money funding your entrepreneurial education whereas if you first get a job, someone is actually paying you to learn. When you are older you have the risk of giving up a well-paid job, putting your family at risk because you have decided to go and try this adventure.\n\nPixSense\u2019s first business model was developed in a coffee shop in Silicon Valley with the founders meeting once every week (because they still had their day jobs) and it took almost 8 months to develop and refine it before the first line of code was ever written. Adnan believes that software can do anything \u2013 it is the business model that has to be right for the venture to succeed. Adnan and his co-founders jumped ship and got into full time entrepreneurship only when they had brainstormed several business models with their mentor, the pros, the cons, what was likely to work and what wasn\u2019t. They finally settled on the one they were going to try out and PixSense became a reality.\n\nJawwad Ahmed Farid spoke about the first company he wanted to start which was an online education site for analysts. He spoke to three professors. The first one asked him how he expected to succeed when some one much more experienced had not been able to write a book on the subject. The second one told him that there was only one way to find out \u2013 give it a shot! Now that he had a tie, he asked the third professor who said that although Jawwad was an unknown quantity and it was difficult to see why analysts at Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sacs etc would pay any attention to whatever he came up with, he agreed with the first professor that the only way to find out was to give it a shot. And Jawwad did. Little did he know that the dot com burst was around the corner and that a much larger player with existing contacts in the finance industry and capital markets already had the same idea.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "We have been there and know what not to\u00a0do!"},

Everything works at such terrific speed.\n\nThe Multi-touch technology works even better on the iPad than it did on the iPhone \u2013 switching between screens, manipulating photos, looking at them in different sizes and angles, arranging them any which way, it is all so easy \u2013 like magic.\n\nReading a book on the iPad is as close to actual reading as is possible. Turning the pages feels like the real thing, looks like the real thing. The resolution (as on all Apple hardware) is absolutely out of this world. You can increase the font size and reading in landscape mode makes it all the more easier on the eyes.\n\nAs for reading the New York Times on the iPad, it is an experience in itself. They have truly made perfect use of the medium \u2013 switching between sections, viewing videos within the paper, listening to audios, it is all absolutely brilliant.\n\nAs for the keyboard, it is huge \u2013 almost the size of the keys on my Macbook. Very easy and intuitive. I had no problem with it at all. Video streamed well. Wifi didn\u2019t disconnect throughout the time I was using it. Browsing is a dream. The Calendar and the Contact apps are terrific. Skype, Facebook and Twitter all work well.\n\nAdobe has incorporated a free iPad app called Ideas. You can now draw something by hand on the iPad with free-flowing creativity as a first draft and then refine it later in Illustrator or Photoshop on your laptop. Another app called iMockups lets you \u201csketch\u201d Web designs. Just some examples of the kind of apps that are being created for the iPad. Of course Apple\u2019s own Keynote and Pages are available for the iPad and there is a connector that one can buy that can connect the iPad to a VGA so that you can use it to present or to connect it to a television or a monitor for watching a movie.\n\nI guess once I get my iPad, I will use it for most things other than very long documents and developing presentations (even that I am not too sure about because I found the keyboard so easy to use). And travel, especially domestically, I don\u2019t think I will have to carry my laptop anymore. The iPad would enable me to do most things on short trips. Yes I know everyone thinks the iPad should have had are a USB port and a camera, and multitasking all of which the next version will probably have .\n\nThanks again Taimur. I loved using your iPad but now I want mine even more desperately!", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The Apple iPad is sooooo\u00a0cool!"},

Very often we have all the ingredients that we need to start a venture \u2013 the right concept or product idea, a great founding team, enough finances to sustain ourselves for a while and the infrastructure and resources that we need. The product sells, we continue to innovate and create, operations move along smoothly and yet suddenly we discover that we are going downhill,\u00a0 that our cash flow is not allowing us to move on or to scale. Something is wrong and it is difficult to identify exactly what. Very often it is the business model which we have adopted that is responsible for the collapse of the business.\n\nOur panel will share their experiences and openly talk about the business model that worked for them,\u00a0 the mistakes they made in the selection of a business model, what they could have done differently and how things can be turned around by tweaking the business model over time and ensuring that it starts delivering value.\n\nBy the end of this session you will understand how to design and implement a new business model or to analyze and renovate an old one.\n\nThe session is taking place at:\n\nPlease be on time. Following the 90 minute session, which will be very interactive, participants will have the opportunity to link up with the panelists and discuss their own business models, find out if they are on track or if they should be doing something differently.\n\nTo register for the event which is free, please email secretariat@pasha.org.pk.\n\nJawwad Ahmed Farid has already put up a post regarding the event \u2013 and I see I am in trouble.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "P@SHA & TiE holding SI session in Karachi on April 14 at 6\u00a0pm"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/04/12/innovation-initiatives/", "text": "Did you know that Pakistan has a Federal Innovation Board? Well, I didn\u2019t know this very important fact until a few weeks ago when I was invited to make a presentation on \u201cInnovation in the Pakistan IT industry\u201d at an Innovation workshop organized by the Competitiveness Support Fund (CSF) and the Higher Education Commission (HEC) in Karachi.\n\nSo what does this Board do one might ask? Well, we were told that in fact the Board hasn\u2019t yet had its first meeting in all the time that it has existed. That is innovative indeed!\n\nVisiting the CSF website I was a little confused. Apparently an Innovation Strategy Working Group (I-SWOG) was set up in April 2009 with the purpose of developing a National Innovation Strategy Framework and for the preparation of a\u00a0 National Innovation Policy for submission to the Cabinet. The Board has been created to oversee all activities related to fostering an innovation ecosystem in Pakistan. Now I am not sure if there are two Boards. They had a couple of meetings in May 2009 and then there is no more information on the site regarding any other activities until this Innovation Workshop which I was a part of on March 4, 2010.\n\nI am told that there is a fresh move to reconstitute the Board and actually move ahead with developing a strategy. So let\u2019s see how things progress. I wish them luck.\n\nWhat I really wanted to highlight in this post was that there is some great stuff happening in Pakistan and some of it is being driven by the HEC. Dr. Sohail Naqvi\u2019s presentation (he is the Executive Director of the HEC) was an eye-opener in many ways. He talked about some of the initiatives taken by the HEC which included the setting up of a Mac Product Design Lab at the University of Gujrat where women come and design some amazing furniture and products. There is a lot of work being done to improve the quality as well as increase the production of citrus and other agricultural produce with amazing results \u2013 almost triple the amount that was being produced before. There is work being done in the development of vaccines and much much more. I pointedly asked Dr. Naqvi why some of these amazing initiatives were not highlighted in the press and and different industry events. He responded that both of us were guilty of the same thing because when I made my presentation on Innovation in the IT industry, it left quite a few people in the room wide-eyed. There is so much innovation taking place in our sector that no-one appears to know about. Obviously Sohail and I will both need to get our act together and showcase all the great work that is taking place a lot more.\n\nDr. Samar Mubarakmand, Member Science & Technology Planning Commission talked about the Competitiveness and Innovation in Pakistan\u2019s Manufacturing industry. This was followed by a presentation from Dr. Lars Eklund, Founder of the Scandinavian Competitiveness Group who talked about the different innovation models that had been adopted by various governments in Sweden and Finland.\n\nBreaking for tea, the roundtable was then broken up into 4 groups who then discussed what the objectives of Pakistan\u2019s short and long term innovation system should be as well as the challenges that would need to be overcome.\n\nIt was a good session that produced some very useful ideas. However, one needs to see where this will go from here. It was good to see people like Faizan Buzdar of Scrybe participating in the workshop but I wish more young people had been involved. After all this strategy is going to affect them. They should be involved in its formulation. Perhaps I am jumping the gun and there will be some move on the part of Arthur Banyan and his team at CSF and Sohail Naqvi and his team at HEC to take this to the universities for input before a concept paper in finalized. Good luck guys. We are here to help in any way we can.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Innovation initiatives?"},

Pattaya Viewpoint (Buddha Hill) is a well-known landmark in South Pattaya, providing a complete view of Jomtien and Pattaya. It is dominated by a massive big Buddha statue painted in gold, some 300 feet above Pattaya\u2019s coastline.\n\nForty years ago Pattaya was just a small village with a few huts scattered along the beach. With financial assistance from some wealthy business people and contributions from the community, the monks of Pattaya built the Big Buddha by hand. It was originally white but was later painted in gold.\n\nSurrounding the Big Buddha are ten or more smaller Buddhas each with their own role in life and seven of them represent the days of the week each of which is a guardian for those born on a particular day of the week. And then of course there was this buddha that became so tired that he decided to get some rest :).\n\nWhat I liked most about the place were the steps leading up to the place. When I first saw the 90 \u2013 100 or so steps leading up to the statue, I nearly turned back because I thought that my knees just couldn\u2019t take that climb. But when I went closer I saw that the steps were very intelligently constructed. I could easily climb them without a problem. They were made just for me :-). If everyone would be considerate enough to make steps like these, I would face no issues at all.\n\nMy favourite buddha of all has always been the laughing/smiling buddha. There is such serenity in the smile, such joy. My kid brother Samar and Ammi also love this buddha so I just couldn\u2019t resist having a photo taken with the smiling buddha.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Visiting some Buddhas in\u00a0Pattaya"},

If you look at most of the hoardings that have been put up on our roads, they are not put up in a sturdy fashion. During rains and strong winds, people and vehicles are in danger of being hurt by flying signboards and hoardings. That is why when I saw these structures on the road leading from Bangkok to Pattaya, I was extremely impressed at how sturdy they were \u2013 something we can definitely learn from.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "If you have to put up a hoarding\u00a0\u2026"},

I have been a Lewis Carroll fan ever since I can remember.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting much and it was just as well. This new Alice in Wonderland shows 19 year old Alice returning to the whimsical world she had known as a child where she meets the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the Dormouse, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the Red Queen, the White Queen and many other characters. Her destiny appears to be to end the Red Queen\u2019s reign of terror by slaughtering the jabberwocky.\n\nIt was strange seeing Alice as a young woman trying to wiggle out of a possible marriage instead of the little girl I remembered from way back when. I guess she did a decent enough job considering that there really wasn\u2019t much of a storyline except for Alice going back in time, falling through the rabbit hole and saving \u201cWonderland\u201d or \u201cUnderland\u201d.\n\nHowever, I had gone to see the film to revel in old memories of the fantasyland of my childhood. In that the movie sufficed. The visuals were strong, colourful and vibrant. My favourite character, as always, was the Cheshire Cat (voice of Stephen Fry). It was done beautifully and each time Chesh popped up I could feel my smile broadening to match his \u2013 his smile has always been so infectious.\n\nA couple of things confused me though. The White Queen who is supposedly the \u201cgood\u201d person in this story appeared to be rather sinister in my view. I found the Red Queen to be more real. I felt sorry for her because it appeared as if she was nasty because of the way she looked and because no-one loved her. The second thing that confused me was when Alice was talking business with her father\u2019s friend regarding opening up the trade routes to China. The map she was looking at appeared to be very clearly defined \u2013 more a 21st century map rather than one that was relevant for that time period. They might as well have used Google Maps if they weren\u2019t concerned about that sort of thing! :-)\n\nAnyway, although I felt that the 3D part was not really capitalized on as much as it could have been and there was no real storyline, it was fun just watching it and seeing some of my favourite characters.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Watching Alice in Wonderland in\u00a03D"},

We didn\u2019t know the significance. All we knew was that it gave us an excuse to think up clever tricks to pull on unsuspecting people. Admittedly, as years passed, April Fools\u2019 Day began to lose its appeal and I more or less let the day pass without giving it much thought.\n\nAll that changed on April 1, 2003. Something earthshattering happened that changed my world forever. My mother, my wonderful sweet mother whose smile lit up every room she walked into, whose very presence brought a serenity into our lives, into our very existence, left us on April 1 seven years ago.\n\nWhen I think about how long it has been, it\u2019s hard to believe that 7 years have gone past. It seems like only yesterday that I came home from work to Ammi\u2019s warm and loving smile. It was a norm. I would walk in, peep into her room to see if she was awake. She would be waiting. I would sit down with her and bring her uptodate on the day\u2019s activities \u2013 whom I had met, what they\u2019d said or done. She was the repository of all my joys and frustrations, of both the good and bad things that happened to me. She knew all about my friends, my business colleagues, people I met through the course of my day.\n\nShe would listen to me chatter on and on smiling indulgently at all the funny bits. She was so proud of every little thing I achieved and she shrugged off every failure as if it didn\u2019t really make a difference to who I was. Ammi made everything seem okay. She was our number one champion. She could see the best in us \u2013 and it was her confidence in our abilities that made us strive to put in that extra effort.\n\nWe are better human beings because Ammi expected that from us. She could never understand cruelty and meanness of spirit. War, struggle, poverty and illness all worried her and she would always try and figure out how we as individuals could make a small difference to the community in which we lived.\n\nThis morning as I placed the orchids that I had brought back from Thailand for her on her grave, I remembered the many times Ammi had smiled at the sight of those lovely flowers.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/03/21/campus-conversations-starts-off-with-a-bang/", "text": "It was my first visit to the FAST-NUCES main campus in Karachi. I had been to the City campus many times but somehow the trek out to the National Highway had always put\u00a0 me off. On 17th March I realized that the campus wasn\u2019t really as far as I had thought. It only took Yusuf Jan and myself 45 minutes to get there. So now that the fear of the unknown is behind me, I guess the second and third visits will not be that tough to undertake :).\n\nThis was the first in a series o f P@SHA-CIO Campus Conversations, the purpose of which is to try and bridge the gap between industry professionals and the faculty and students at the Universities throughout Pakistan \u2013 one of the initiatives that will hopefully address the HR and Recruitment problems that everyone complains about.\n\nThe panelists from the industry included myself, Yusuf Jan, Head of\u00a0MIXIT Technologies (and current Chairman of P@SHA), Ashar Zaidi, Country Manager Intel Pakistan;; Rahim Lalani Head of\u00a0TRG Tech; and Danish Nafay, Deputy Manager SBS at\u00a0National Foods Limited.\n\nFrom the academia side, the representatives included Professor Zafar Nasir, Head of Department (CS), Dr. Zubair Sheikh, Director FAST Karachi Campus, Amna Ali, Ravendar Laal, Taha Rafiq and Sohaib Qamar.\n\nI will not go into a blow -by-blow account of what was said, and by whom, because that is all available in the videos that have been uploaded at the CIO Webstudio. However, I just wanted to mention some of the highlights. A more complete coverage with photos is available at http://ciopakistan.com/2010/03/campus-conversations-goes-to-fast/.\n\nThe faculty and the students were very welcoming and, as always, it was a pleasure to be amongst bright youngsters who would soon be a part of our industry. The industry representatives started by explaining their domain areas and the kind of work that was done in their organisations. This was important so that the kids would know what kind of work scenario awaited them. Their mantra was that they were all looking for smart, committed, enthusiastic and hardworking young people who wanted to do something in their lives.\n\nRahim Lalani, head of TRG Tech, insisted that the GPA was one of the things that he considered before interviewing an applicant for a job \u2013 his reason was that since they were all smart kids (getting into one of the best tech schools in the country was indicative of that, he said), and they had such good faculty, a low GPA could only mean one thing \u2013 that they had been lazy and had not worked hard enough \u2013 and he didn\u2019t want lazy people on his team.\n\nThe other industry players placed less emphasis on the GPA and more on problem solving skills (which Rahim also looks for), and the ability to learn & imbibe new things and to communicate and work with teams of people.\n\nYusuf Jan was of the opinion that most of our youngsters spoke better English than was spoken in metropolitan cities like New York so they didn\u2019t have to be hesitant and tentative.\n\nFAST has started language classes because of feedback from industry that kids lacked sufficient communication skills. My take is that it is not only the language, it is the communication area that is weak \u2013\u00a0 the inability of most youngsters to convey an idea in 30 \u2013 60 seconds in any language! But then how many professionals can do that? :)\n\nSome of the kids felt that there weren\u2019t sufficient internship opportunities provided by industry and hence they lacked the knowledge of the real world workplace. One student asked why industry players expected graduates to be ready and productive as soon as they left university. Why did they not feel that it was their responsibility to train youngsters who joined their organisations for six months?\n\nDanish Nafay of National Foods said that the corporate sector usually did not hire fresh graduates. It was only after youngsters had spent 3 years in a software company that the corporates picked them up.\u00a0 Mixit and TRG Tech had hired throughout the depression and continued to be on a recruitment drive \u2013 but they said they only hire the best, the smartest,\u00a0 thinking, indquisitive and problem-solving young minds who were high achievers and hard workers.\n\nOne thing that struck me was that the youngsters were unsure of what awaited them. Some of them had chosen computer science without actually knowing what careers were available, others didn\u2019t know the technology landscape. Book learning is important but a holistic knowledge of the business and societal problems that technology can solve, is extremely important. This was echoed by one of the kids when he said \u201cI am confused \u2013 tell me what I should do\u201d.\n\nSome of these young people were already working on developing applications and products and needed guidance and direction. Others needed career counseling.\n\nOne thing was for sure. Industry needed to increase its interaction with these young people. I know some of us speak at universities and go to view and assess final year projects but a more concerted effort is needed to keep the conversation going, and to finding solutions.\n\nThe solutions that were offered included:\n\nP@SHA will start an online mentoring network for kids who needed advice on careers or projects\n\n P@SHA will start a P@SHA University Chapter \u2013 the first one being at FAST Karachi\n\n P@SHA will also start a series of regular tech talks and business interaction with universities \u2013 Mixit Technologies will be sending their team to FAST in April, TRG Tech will do also send a speaker. They have already been doing so. We will now start signing up other CEOs, CTOs and Project Managers from across the country and will ensure that regular sessions are conducted at different universities.\n\nAsher Zaidi offered his time for a session at the City Campus and Danish Nafay also said that he would run a session.\n\nI think the \u201cconversation \u201d has started off well. The next one is at NED University on the 27th \u2013 and the journey will continue \u2026.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Campus Conversations starts off with a\u00a0bang!"},

I have explained it a little in this interview with Rabia Garib at the CIO Webstudio.\n\nToday\u2019s panel includes Yusuf Jan of Mixit Technologies, Rahim Lalani of TRG Tech, Ashar Zaidi of Intel Pakistan & Danish Nafay of National Foods. Rabia Garib and I will be there too of course! We are heading out to the FAST Karachi Main Campus.

VAW and ICT needs to be taken to schools, colleges and universities.\n\n2. There is a need to develop an online portal where all policies, resources, reports, discussions, strategies, links to videos and presentations & to women support groups can be provided. This portal should also contain information on how or who to report VAW to, what process to follow and who to contact in case help or advice is needed.\n\n3. It was strongly felt that the TakeBacktheTech website should be localized to achieve maximum impact and outreach.\n\n4. Presentations on VAW & ICT should be developed and shared so that various TBTT activists can use the same material when presenting at schools and colleges across the country.\n\n5. More detailed hands-n workshops and awareness sessions are needed to learn the Online Activism Tools and how to maintain Privacy and Security online.\n\n6. There was a need for various stakeholders to continue to raise issues, keep them current and advocate policy interventions that were required to ensure that women-friendly policies were framed and adopted.\n\nParticipants were told about the upcoing Feminist Tech Exchanges (FTX) that were being planned, the Digital Storytelling sessions and the Small Grants that would enable some interesting and useful initiatives.\n\nFariha live-blogged from the workshop on both days and I have a sneaking suspicion that a few of the people who showed up on Day 2 did so because Fariha made it sound like a discussion that just couldn\u2019t be missed \u2013 and she was right.\n\nI came out of the two day workshop feeling that we had accomplished a great deal, that we had created linkages that would serve us in our activism and our policy efforts for a long long time. All the work that had gone into organizing this workshop, had been more than well worth it. Shahzad and I thanked Nuzhat Kidvai and Tahira Abdullah for their support and their guidance throughout the process. Without them we would never have been able to get the kind of participation that we did. We also thanked all the out-of-towners who had showed up and engaged in discussions.\n\nThe workshop may have ended but Fariha, Nighat, Shahzad and I sat in the hotel lobby having coffee or tea and going over all that had been said over the past two days and planning what needed to be done next. Follow up activities were very important to keep the momentum going. Many important issues had been flagged and we needed to make sure that they were addressed and we lived up to our commitments.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "ICT & VAW: National Strategy Workshop Part\u00a03"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/03/16/ict-vaw-national-strategy-workshop-part-2/", "text": "After the intense morning session, Dr. Awab Alvi (better known as Teeth Maestro), gave a very enlightening presentation on \u201cOnline Activism Tools\u201d. He engaged the participants in a discussion on how they currently engaged in activism, awareness-creation and policy advocacy and showed them how various online social media and SMS tools can be used to effectively involve people in activism on important issues. He also showed them how to organize groups of people for rallies and protests and how to remain annonymous if one needed to, while engaging in these activities. Some of the tools were even new to those of us who are actively using new media already. Awab\u2019s talk was received very well and participants asked him a lot of questions which he answered very patiently.\n\nThe next presentation was by Rabia Garib, Editor-in-Chief of CIO Pakistan. She spoke about Online Privacy and how to keep oneself safe online while using all the latest technologies. \u201cWe are our first line of defence\u201d, she said and there are simple things we can do to ensure that we are secure online and that our privacy is not invaded.\n\nShe gave some common-sense tips that participants could follow to avoid being cyber-stalked and to keep ones personal data \u201cprivate\u201d. She made it all sound so simple and easy to do. The Q&A showed how interesting and relevant the talk had been.\n\nOn the second day of the workshop Tahira Abdullah gave a very comprehensive presentation on existing laws and policies that affected VAW in Pakistan. She explained how many of the policies were actually in conflict with the Constitution of Pakistan. The presentation was extremely detailed and presented with the passion that one has come to expect from Tahira. She had participants listening intently to every word she uttered. A copy of the presentation is available for download here.\n\nTahira spoke about seve ral pieces of legislation and policies that had been enacted over the years and explained how they were inadequate. These included the Women\u2019s Protection Act, the distorted Domestic Violence Bill, the laws on Sexual Harrassment in the Workplace and a draft bill on Reproductive Health and Rights. Her contention was that positive new legislation cannot be effective without repealing existing anti-women legislation. She also emphasized that there was a need to collect, compile and analyze all data sets disaggregated by gender. There also needed to be greater participation of women in all fora: political, economic, legislative \u2013 decision-making and policy planning, she said.\n\nI then made my presentation on the Prevention of E-Crime Ordinance & VAW \u2013 the gaps, the issues and why all of us should be concerned and should work with the government to bring about the changes that are necessary. In fact the consensus was that any policy that was being formulated should have a gender element and focus to it.\n\n(Part 3 of this post will be put up in the morning).", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "ICT & VAW \u2013 National Strategy Workshop (part\u00a02)"},

There was anticipation and yet there was fear \u2013 anticipation because it was an important initiative that we were all excited to be a part of; fear that perhaps we had taken on more than we could handle, that the relevant people would not show up, etc. etc.\n\nBut we needn\u2019t have worried. They were all there \u2013\u00a0 the presenters and all the stakeholders \u2013 an interesting mix of women\u2019s rights organizations, activists, media professionals, bloggers, la wyers and technologists who had gotten together to develop a National Strategy for the \u201cStrategic Use of ICT to combat Violence Against Women and girls.\u201d We had made arrangements for between 40 \u2013 50 participants but were not expecting more than 25 to show up. Imagine our surprise when close to 50 showed up on both days and actively and passionately participated in the proceedings.\n\nAfter having got the welcome and introduction of the project out of the way, Shahzad Ahmed of BytesforAll and I (on behalf of P@SHA) handed over to Nuzhat Kidvai who has been a key part of the Women\u2019s Movement in Pakistan for many years. Nuzhat had been requested to present highlights from the draft Country Issue Paper which had been put together by Kyla Pasha. She did this very coolly while pointing out that the statistics and surveys were weak and some of the facts inaccurate.\n\nTahira Abdullah, a very outspoken and well-respected long-time activist from Islamabad, was not that gentle. She tore the paper to shreds (metaphorically speaking) stating that whoever had written it had very little knowledge of the women\u2019s movement in Pakistan, its uphill struggle for decades and its achievements. Some of the key areas that she highlighted were:\n\n1. The statistics, facts and figures in the paper were taken from an Aurat Foundation report that was already out of date and contained results that were questioned by Aurat Foundation themselves.\n\n2. The surveys conducted for the Issue Paper were very superficial and limited to a very small segment of te population. The results therefore did not reflect the facts.\n\n3. Types of VAW that were listed in the paper were incomplete\n\n4. The commentary and opinion stated about the Women\u2019s movement was offensive, insulting and false. The paper stated that the women\u2019s movement targeted religous groups and was anti-religion but did not take up the legitimate causes of VAW. The paper also stated that women\u2019s rights organizations did not conduct research or provide input to the government on policies. Nothing was further from the truth, said Tahira. Consistent research had been carried out, policies had not only been scrutinized and commented on point by point, some policies had actually been drafted and provided to the government to move things along.\n\n5. The list of organizations in the Issue Paper was anything but complete and in fact contained some organisations that were responsible for some of the ills that were faced by women in Pakistan.\n\n6. The policies mentioned within the Issue Paper were also incomplete.\n\nTahira\u2019s critical analysis of the paper was added to by Nuzhat Kidvai (who now felt she didn\u2019t have to hold back how strongly she felt about the quality of the paper and its contents), Hilda Saeed and Nilofur Farrukh, all of whom had been active members of the Women\u2019s Action Forum for decades.\n\nAfter much passionate discourse, there was consensus that the paper needed to be re-drafted. Nuzhat Kidvai and Tahira Abdullah were requested to take responsibility for different parts of the paper and involve anyone else who was required.\n\nAfter the intense discussion on the Issue Paper the group broke for a sumptuous lunch.\n\nWatch out for Episode 2 of this report ;-) which will be posted soon.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "P@SHA & Bytes4All organize National Strategy\u00a0Workshop"},

Their main objective, they say, is to help the industry grow. And what is more important is that they are taking all stakeholders on board and are holding consultation sessions with different segments of the industry before they embark on any new initiatives.\n\nOn Tuesday for instance, CEOs from technology companies in Punjab have been invited to the PITB office in Model Town to discuss an initiative which is being referred to as the IT Bootcamp.\n\nThe purpose of this meeting is to discuss and agree upon tentative outlines for an IT Boot Camp for fresh graduates to prepare them for the current job market. The gap in knowledge and skill of fresh graduates has been something that has been voiced by many CEOS and CTOs in Pakistan as well as around the region.\n\nThe first IT Boot Camp of 50 students at each of the campuses is being planned this summer for about 9 weeks and will be conducted at the FAST, PUCIT and LUMS campuses. So what is the idea? The program will be advertised and applicants will be screened online before they are asked to come for interviews and tests at various IT colleges. The course fee will be Rs.100,000, 80% of which will be subsidized by PITB.\n\nIT companies are being asked to assist in structuring the program and the course content, as well as to teach the course. Companies are also being asked to provide 12 month internships to all students who pass out of this Boot Camp. PITB will give Rs. 10,000 subsidies for 6 months for each student thus employed.\n\nSome reservations have already been expressed. There is a larger supply of qualified graduates available on the market right now than there were in previous years so is the Boot Camp really necessary at this stage? Will the program be able to attract good quality applicants from Tier1/Tier2/Tier 3 universities? And even if it does attract them, how does one incentivize these kids to spend 9 weeks in a Boot Camp and consider investing Rs. 20,000 to improve their chances of getting a good job? Is it even feasible to expect them to? Will companies commit to hiring these kids? Will they stick to their commitments? Will they take time out to help structure and deliver the program? How can continuity be ensured? The PITB\u2019s\u00a0 intent is that this not be a one-off program.\n\nAfter the completion of the first Boot Camp, they want to extend the program to other cities in Punjab like Faisalabad and Multan and to other university campuses.\n\nI have asked PITB\u2019s permission to put up this information so that some of you can contribute to the discussion and help them make this into a workable program that has a buy-in from all stakeholders. Come on guys and gals. These chaps are trying to do something for our industry. Let\u2019s help them. They are open to productive feedback, criticism and ideas. The team comprising Dr. Jawaid Ghani, the Chairman, Athar Mian, the Chief Strategy Officer, COO Joudat Ayaz and Nasser Lone are all very gung-ho and are keen to help the IT sector grow. Let us extend our support as partners and team-players.\n\nI guess some of these questions will be answered during the meeting on Tuesday which I am looking forward to attending.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "PITB\u2019s upcoming IT Bootcamp\u00a0initiative"},

Fortunately I have always been granted visas that exempt me from police reporting although city restrictions have applied. We have all constantly grumbled about that but have learnt to live with it until both governments see reason and try and find a better, simpler way \u2013 maybe a Saarc visa that allows easier access across borders for business, culture and tourism. It would help create a better understanding and would drive the economic and social development of all countries in the region. Far-fetched? Perhaps.\n\nLast week in Mumbai, something happened that has never happened before. I received a call from the reception desk asking me to go downstairs with my passport and papers because there were some gentlemen from the CID who wished to see me. I was a bit taken aback but of course the request could not be ignored so I sauntered downstairs and came face-to-face with three CID types.\n\nIn the meantime my colleagues Faisal Khan and Syed Ahmad had received similar phone calls and were trying desperately to get me on the phone. As Syed said, they figured they needed to let someone know what was going on in case they were taken away to some unknown destination by these guys. Paranoia? Maybe not. It is a dangerous world and agencies around the world are increasingly being given more and more powers at the cost of the rights of individuals.\n\nAnyway, to cut to the chase, we met with the three gentlemen from the CID in the lobby and as they went through our documents, we chatted about the kilos of kaju katli we had bought that morning and the amount of last minute shopping we had done resulting in Faisal having to help me carry loads of packages back to the hotel. We laughed and chatted partly to overcome the nervousness we felt at being investigated. How does one behave when one is being viewed suspiciously by guys whose job it is to suspect anyone and everyone? Having said that, the CID guys didn\u2019t quite know how to handle our nonchalant behaviour either. They kept trying to draw our attention away from the kaju katli discussion to the seriousness of the checking that was being done. They asked us why we were India, how long we had been there, when we were leaving, etc etc.\n\nI thought they had asked enough questions so I started asking them some questions. Yeah yeah that is one way of dealing with a situation one has not been trained to handle :). I asked them if we had the honour of their visit because of what had happened the night before. They pretended not to know what I was referring to. I wasn\u2019t going to let go so easily so I persisted \u201cYou know \u2013 the Pune blast!\u201d They responded by saying that it had nothing to do with that and that this was just routine standard operating procedure. I smiled and said \u201cWell, I have been coming to India on business for the past 8 years and I have never had the pleasure of seeing you or your colleagues before.\u201d They smiled slightly and ignored my remark. After they had gone through all the papers and asked their questions, they thanked us and left. And that was the end of an encounter that none of us wanted to go through again. It was an uncomfortable situation at best.\n\nWhat amused me was what Syed said next. He wanted to know why it was that in the movies the CID/CIA types were all depicted as good looking, dashing and glamorous guys when in fact in real life, they weren\u2019t. Good question Syed! :) I wouldn\u2019t have minded a visit from a James-Bond type.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "How does one behave when visited by the\u00a0CID?"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/playing-tourist-in-mumbai/", "text": "There are currently only two flights a week from Mumbai to Karachi so we had to stay on in Mumbai for a few extra days thus giving us the opportunity to play tourist. So after breakfast on Saturday we decided to leave the hotel and head for South Bombay (which is about 20+ kilometres from where we were staying). Taking a cab would have been boring. So we thought why not travel by train as most of the locals do in Mumbai. It is, after all, one of the most heavily used rail networks in the world. So off we went.\n\nWe took the scenic route to the train terminal \u2013 the skywalk which gave us a birds eye view of this part of the city \u2013 the traffic jams, some slums and the 60 sq km of mangroves in Mumbai which are\u00a0 known to attract nearly 206 species of birds, 35-40 reptiles, 16 crabs, at least three types of prawns and several fish species.\n\nMost cities have poor, crowded, under-developed areas as well as highly developed modern segments, but this city is truly a contradiction. You get off the plane and on the way to your 5-star hotel, you will see little khokas, slum housing alongside some of the finest buildings and highways.\n\nWhat is unnerving is that with the wealth that is being generated in this country, the slums don\u2019t appear to be decreasing, nor does the number of those who live below the poverty line. At least that is the impression I get having travelled here many times during the past 9 years.\n\nAs we looked around we saw how some of the poor people lived, with huts constructed on water pipes & sewerage piple, the water that flowed in the fields where their vegetables grew (and was probably the water they drank & used for washing clothes and utensils) was absolutely black. And yet as we walked, we saw how technology is becoming quite pervasive with satellites of Airtel, Tata and other carriers finding their way on to p of these make-shift homes.\n\nWe finally made it to the train station. It was not that long a walk but since we stopped for discussions and photos, it took a lot longer. Anyway, after purchasing the train tickets, we waited for a train that had apparently already departed but the sign didn\u2019t indicate the change. When the train arrived, we got into the first class cabin and started our journey. We were told that sometimes, the kids whose homes were on either side of the tracks, tended to throw stones at the train purely for fun not realizing that it could take someone\u2019s eye out, or as in the case of someone we know, actually cause a death because it hit him on the head at great speed.\n\nAs we emerged from the train station\u00a0 in South Bombay, we saw how beautiful the Railway terminus building and the Town Hall. Great photo opps for sure :).\n\nWe continued our walk to Kala Ghora but the walk was interrupted by stops at Bookzone and a computer bookshop where Syed Ahmad went crazy. He ended up buying so many books that they had to arrange delivery to the hotel :).\n\nWe couldn\u2019t spend much time at Khala Ghora because we had planned to head off to Elephanta Island to see the caves. We had just enough time for a quick but substantial lunch before we hurried on to the Gateway of India having bought ferry tickets for Elephanta.\n\nI love being on the water so the one and a half hour ferry ride, with the wind blowing across my face, was just what I neede d. When we got to the island, and I realized that I was expected to climb 100 steps to get to the caves, I decided I was going to stay put while Syed and Faisal sauntered off. Thanks to Syed\u2019s flip, I was able to see what I had missed \u2013 amazing carvings out of stone, most of them damaged over time. Totally worth seeing.\n\nThe Taj Hotel and the Gateway of India are both such lovely structures by day and by night.\n\nWe got back from Elephanta Island and then I broke away from the group for a while so that I could go check out Kala Ghoda Festival which is an annual 9-day festival started off in 1999 and held in early February, in the Kala Ghoda area of South Mumbai.\n\nThe Festival is organised by the Kala Ghoda Association (a non-profit organisation that states its objectives as \u201cphysically upgrading the Kala Ghoda sub-precinct and making it the Art District of Mumbai\u201d) and curated by teams handling each of the sub-festivals.\n\nThe sub-festivals feature the visual arts, dance, music, theatre, cinema, literature, lectures, seminars and workshops, heritage walks, special events for children, and a vibrant street festival. Entry to all events is free and costs are met through corporate sponsorship.\n\nAs I walked around the festival exhibition area looking at the arts and crafts stalls put up by various NGOs, and listening to the musicians and watching the dancers who were performing on the Open Air stage, it was nice to see how people from different parts of society had converged on the site enjoying all the activities that had been arranged for them free of charge \u2013 a great way to promote art and culture.\n\nI wandered around until it was time to meet up with the others and head back to the hotel.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/02/12/nasscom-2010-this-is-how-it-began/", "text": "On February 9 as the four of us \u2013 Yusuf Jan, Faisal Shuja Khan, Syed Ahmad and I \u2013 walked into the Grand Hyatt, and registered for Nasscom 2010, we met various people from the Nasscom team and from the Indian IT industry. Some were old friends who were happy to see us and others were people that we were meeting for the first time. As we chatted and caught up, it was obvious how easy it was to relate to each other and once again I thought how unfortunate it was that we couldn\u2019t meet more easily and more frequently. This was echoed by a lot of the people I met who thought that as a region we were losing out because we could not capitalize on combining our strengths and collaborating to make our region richer and more vibrant. \u201cLook at what others around the world have been able to do in the EU, NAFTA, Asean,\u201d said someone I have been meeting at various Nasscom events over the years. Yes we have disagreements which we may never resolve but does that mean we should let that keep us from developing our region and letting the benefits of such collaboration alleviate some of the common issues that plague our people? I am not a political being and have never really understood if wars and strife and political posturing ever helped anyone. I am not naive enough to believe that serious problems don\u2019t exist but as Yusuf pointed out, can our politicians not let a functional layer continue to operate with efficiency while they blow \u201chot and cold\u201d at the political level? We have spent the past 62 years fighting several wars, making political statements that helped neither side, keeping each other from alleviating the poverty that exists in our countries, from sharing the strengths and talents that exist in our region and from developing an understanding that could perhaps one day lead to solutions that we as independent nations are looking for.\n\nAnyway, at our level, we continue to try and meet, to exchange views and to learn from each other. Som Mittal, President of Nasscom, warmed our hearts when during his inaugural address at Nasscom 2010, he said that he specially wanted to extend a warm welcome to the delegates from Pakistan. There were 1700 delegates at the Nasscom event this year. This included around 300 foreign delegates. Som was one of the key people who was responsible for processing our visas as quickly as he could. He called the Home Minister himself to ensure that it was done. Thanks Som.\n\nThe inaugural session included the traditional lighting of the diyas, the addresses by the Chairman and President of Nasscom who talked about how a 5.5% growth had been achieved despite the recession, how challenges like the Satyam scandal had been dealt with and how the Indian IT industry had to transform itself to address the challenges that were yet to come. Complacency should not be adopted simply because they had acheived as much as they had. \u2018Giving back\u2019 and addressing the problems of the rest of India was something that was repeated throughout the conference. The Indian IT industry lives in a magical bubble despite having created massive employment opportunities and wealth for their country. The focus therefore was on how to extend the benefits to the smaller cities, towns and villages.\n\nThe Chief Guest at the inaugural session was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra Mr. Ashok Chavan who talked about the increasing adoption of technology by the government and the growth in government services that would impact on the larger number of citizens in the country.\n\nI am glad to see that Nasscom is now awarding products that are being developed to address social issues. Jerry Rao who is the Chairman of the Nasscom Foundation announced this year\u2019s winners during the opening of the conference and the Chief Minister presented them with awards. Although there is a long way to go to get corporate India (and for that matter corporate Pakistan) actively involved in the social use of technology (this was pointed out during the CSR track at the conference where you could see a larger percentage of women), at least there has been a beginning. In fact one of the participants brought this up during the Q&A session commenting that it was the heart of India that was in that room. Maybe the rest of India would follow, he said.\n\nSome of the applications that were showcased in the CSR track were not innovative in themselves but were impressive in the volume of adoption that had been achieved. I was happy to see that areas like health of the masses, missing children and education were high on the agenda. Again this is an area that organizations on both sides of the border are working in and where the benefits of each others work, research and experience can be shared very easily.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Nasscom 2010 \u2013 this is how it\u00a0began"},

So having checked in to this lovely new hotel, Faisal, Syed and I headed for the iMax Cinema with Vickram Crishna, a friend and colleague based in Mumbai. We had decided we were going to watch Avatar.\n\nThe iMax Cinema in Mumbai is a beautiful building in the middle of nowhere. I guess more development will happen eventually but at the moment one actually has to plan an expedition (an exaggeration really because it was only 20 minutes by car). There was no problem with tickets because it was the 4.15 show.\n\nOnce the tickets were purchased we bought popcorn, nachos, vege-burgers and drinks and went in search of our seats. Much of the food was consumed even before the movie began. Remember we hadn\u2019t had lunch because the immigration process had taken so long.\n\nDonned with our 3D glasses, we watched trailers\u00a0 until the movie began. Syed and Faisal had already watched the 2D version but were keen to watch the 3D version. I was watching it for the first time and WOW! It was simply amazing. The production, the graphics, the animation, the music, the dash of romance, the sci-fi. It just totally blew me away. I was so glad we had decided to come watch it. The strange thing about the movie is that it has done so well at the box office in the US (admittedly 70% of the revenue is from outside the US) even though the movie\u2019s storylin e shows America as the big evil, aggressive megapower who, acting out of greed, totally tries to destroy an entire civilization to get what it wants. I would highly recommend that this movie be watched in 3D if at all possible. The experience is totally out of this world.\n\nHaving \u2018done\u2019 the movie, we decided it was time to have our first South Indian meal. Before we did that, we happened to pass the bookshop \u201cCrossword\u2019 and, as expected, we immediately lost Faisal. The rest of us followed and all three of us ended up buying some books.\n\nThe cab ride to the restaurant took us through a large part of the back alleys of Mumbai thanks to Vickram. The traffic is crazy at that time of day and it took us an hour and fifteen minutes to get there. Quite a ride. The meal was sumptuous \u2013 dossa, pau bhaji, uppatums, idli/sambar, lassi and anaar ka juice, at the end of which we were totally stuffed and the immigration woes were totally forgotten. A great start to the trip with another 6 days to look forward to.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The partying begins!"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/the-journey-to-mumbai/", "text": "On the flight to Mumbai from Karachi were people from all walks of life \u2013 across the aisle was Javed Jabbar who was obviously on a mission vis-a-vis Ramchand Pakistani or perhaps some other film; sitting next to me was a lady who had lost her husband five years ago and had been in denial for all this time, filling her time with work and family obligations. Now she was\u00a0 off to visit family in Mumbai and then going on to Bangalore to a health farm to detoxify and come to terms with the reality of her position and in order to start living again. There were musicians who were possibly headed for an Aman-ki-Aasha event (which i was told Zia Mohyeddin was also flying up for). There were old people who were flying to India to meet family. There were\u00a0 some tourists, young honeymooners, and couples with small children who were either just out to discover Bollywood or were heading to Mumbai to catch up with family and friends.\n\nThe flight itself was a very short one \u2013 one hour and 25 minutes and although take-off was 10 minutes late due to air-traffic control, we landed in Mumbai at 12 noon. We were excited about the upcoming conference and happy that the visa had been granted. It had been a real hassle this time with Home Ministry clearance, NoCs from the Ministry of External Affairs and the Maharashtra State Government all being part of the requirements. The President and Vice President of Nasscom, and several friends within the Association, had put in a lot of effort to ensure that we got our visas at the 11th hour. Unfortunately our visas were single entry, Mumbai-only conference visas for a 10 day period, instead of the multiple-entry business visas that we had requested, which would have included cities like Bangalore, Delhi and Hyderabad.\n\nI wish that after 60+ years both our governments could get their act together and make it possible for legitimate travelers to get visas easily so that they could travel to multiple cities. I think ours must be the only countries that provide city-specific visas instead of country visas. It is so idiotic. What if I meet someone at this Nasscom conference with whom I want to explore a business relationship. He or she may be based in Bangalore or Pune or Chennai. I cannot travel to those cities because I had not foreseen that I would meet this person and would be traveling to any of these cities so I wouldn\u2019t have a visa for that city. Can you believe that if I apply for a multiple entry visa, I need to specify which cities I will be visiting on each of these trips, where I will be staying, etc etc. Absolutely absurd! And both Pakistan and India have these requirements for each other\u2019s nationals.\n\nBut that is not even the beginning of the absurdity. Listen intently to what happens when we land. The flight took only 1 hour and 25 mins but then, because we were Pakistani nationals, we had to form a single file at one counter where our passport particulars were manually noted down by an immigration person. The process was painfully slow. There were old people, people in wheelchairs, infants and business people who just stood there patiently as the queue inched forward. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The officials were all very polite, very friendly and even apologetic at times for the discomfort but this process, defined by some very wise people in Delhi and Islamabad, had to be adhered to. Once we were registered, we were given resident permits which we had to fill up before we could proceed to the immigration desks.\n\nI thought that now things would happen quickly but we were unfortunate. Mumbai airport had just installed new software that day, which most officers did not really know how to use, so as they strugged with it, the passengers waited. Their supervisors helped them but the process took time so it was only 2 hours after landing that we finally ventured out to grab a cab.\n\nWe were met by a very nice young man from Trident Hotel where we were staying who helped us get into an airconditioned cab and half an hour later we finally walked into the beautiful Trident Hotel in Bandra Kurla Complex tired but happy to have that ordeal behind us. Hopefully the rest of the trip will be free of bureaucratic hassles.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The journey to\u00a0Mumbai"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2010/02/04/connecting-with-an-old-friend-on-facebook/", "text": "I don\u2019t remember exactly when I first met Adrian Batten. I know it was during the 1978 \u2013 1981 timeframe. He was a marketeer who came to sell media space in international trade publications to GESL, a shipping company for which I worked. I remember thinking, even in those days, that Adrian was a born salesman and could possibly talk eskimos into buying bikinis if he wanted to. :) The company I worked for in Hong Kong was not in a mood to advertise at that point in time so I really didn\u2019t see that much of him. In fact I evaded him as much as I could.\n\nThen I moved to the UAE for about 5 years and when I returned to Hong Kong in 1985 and was looking for a job, I came face-to-face with none other than Adrian Batten. The woman who was his Recruitment Manager/Executive Assistant interviewed me first. I don\u2019t think she liked me very much and would probably have thrown my CV aside if Adrian hadn\u2019t spotted it and insisted on interviewing me himself. As the interview progressed and I asked him more questions than he asked me, I found him looking more and more amused. Before I could puzzle over that for too long, he wound up the interview by saying \u201cWell, if you are as good at marketing as you are at evading marketing people, you will be a brilliant addition to the team\u201d.\n\nI think he sensed my confusion at that point cos he said \u201cYou obviously don\u2019t remember me,\u201d and proceeded to tell me of our old connection, so to speak. I was horrified and embarrassed that I had forgotten, but he just laughed. Anyway, he offered me a job instantly. I told him that I needed to look at the material he had given me and make a decision on whether I would be happy doing this kind of work.\n\nI did however end up joining Headway Media and spent 9 happy and interesting years working with Adrian to make it into a very successful regional Far East player. We worked well together. I travelled a lot during that period and after a couple of years, Adrian promoted me, eventually making me a Director in the company and giving me 25% shares. By the time I left Headway, I was running it as Managing Director. Adrian\u2019s interest in it had waned over time and he was spending more and more time away either in the US or in Bali where, alongwith his fiance Nicole, he was planning to set up a Spiritual Healing Center.\n\nIn the years we worked together, Adrian and I became friends. We developed a mutual respect for each other and he trusted me implicitly with all things to do with the company. When he gave me sole signing authority on all of the company\u2019s accounts \u2013 US$, Deutsch Marks, Pound Sterling, HK$ etc, I questioned him saying \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do that Adrian. How do you know I won\u2019t clean up the accounts and run away with the money?\u201d He just looked at me and said \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d How could I have betrayed that kind of trust?\n\nWhen I left the company and moved to Pakistan in 1993-1994, because of my mother\u2019s ill health, it was tough. Headway Media had in a sense become my company. I felt a sense of responsibility, a sense of ownership. And Adrian and the team had become like family. We had shared so many ups and downs, so many stressful times, so many successes.\n\nAdrian\u2019s name came up during a conversation I was having with Zak the other day. Zak had spent some time working out of the Headway office in Hong Kong and he and Adrian had developed a good relationship. We wondered what Adrian was up to and where he was, so I searched for him on Facebook. And lo and behold, there he was \u2013 still in Bali, still \u201cin a relationship\u201d with Nicole. Hey Adrian, I have heard of long engagements, but come on man, this has gone on long enough, don\u2019t you think? :)\n\nAdrian Batten recognized my potential and gave me an opportunity to learn a business I knew nothing about. He gave me breathing room to grow into the job, making of it what I would \u2013 going all the way to becoming head honcho (well, technically as Group Managing Director, he was still head honcho). He trusted me with a company that he had started, that was his baby. He recognized my sense of values, my integrity and my contribution to the growth of the company,\u00a0 and treated me with the respect I deserved.\n\nThis anecdote is a great example of the kind of person Adrian is.\u00a0 Adrian had set up a meeting with a very important Publisher from Japan. Unfortunately something came up and so Adrian wasn\u2019t in the office when the Japanese gentleman arrived. Our secretary told him that Mr. Batten had been detained but that he could meet with me. He met with me but would not discuss details of the agreement. When Adrian called him later to ask what the problem was, he said he couldn\u2019t negotiate or sign a deal with a woman. Anyone else would probably have met with the guy and signed the deal which was more or less in the bag but not Adrian. He told the man \u201cMs Jehan Ara is the Managing Director of Headway Media. If you cannot deal with her, then you can\u2019t deal with Headway.\u201d And that was that! Is it surprising then that I remember him fondly, and am glad to be back in contact with him?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Connecting with an old friend on\u00a0Facebook"},

He is the CEO of TkXel, a company based in Lahore with a staff strength of 35. Umair says they are still 10 people short but there is only a certain type of individual that he is prepared to hire and that kind of individual is not that easily available.\n\nIn this interview with Umair on ITLoW, I tried to capture the essence of what Umair has been doing in the technology space, where he feels the stumbling blocks are and what he is doing to counter the problems that exist.\n\nTkXel (or Technology Accelerated) works in the Software Development space with a niche in Mobile Application and Rich Internet Application development (mostly for the international market). They have, however, recently started offering their expertise in Social Media Marketing to local companies.\n\nUmair is a graduate of UET Lahore and a Gold Medalist from LUMS with a couple of years experience at Techlogix who then decided to venture into the entrepreneurial space. He also teaches at LUMS and several other institutions because he thinks that if we are to get the kind of individuals we need for our companies, we have to contribute towards developing them.\n\nAlthough a large component of TkXel\u2019s revenue still comes from services, they have increasingly got into the product space and have developed high value games that have done extremely well on the Apple App store with their Real Deer Hunting game having made it to the Top 100 all paid apps, Top 50 games, Top 5 Simulation, What\u2019s Hot and Best Fishing & Hunting games categories.\n\nThe iPhone is the best thing that could have happened for Pakistani developers, says Umair Javed, because it has given us access to end-users in the US and European markets without the need for a marketing team based in those markets. TkXel has had a 100% acceptance rate on the Apple App Store.\n\nThe absence of a Payment Gateway came up again and I assured him that we were working on many fronts to make it happen.\n\nBut enough said already, I am not going to give the whole interview away in this post.

The air was full of energy and we didn\u2019t really\u00a0 need the Red Bull.\n\nListening to Badar Khushnood\u2019s presentation the second time was just as fun as it had been the first time around. While Fariha blogged, I tweeted and took some photos :).\n\nThe participants were totally engaged from the get-go and some of them challenged and dug deep into what Badar had to say. Others amongst them \u2013 people like Adnan Ali who is a Google certified expert, and Zafar Khan of Sofizar who is a SEO whiz, were able to assist.

His choice of printer and frame-maker was amazingly economical too. Gosh we have quite a community! They all pitch in to make it all happen. Thanks guys. You\u2019re the best.\n\n\n\nThe networking that followed was very intense. People shared ideas, techniques and experiences. They caught up with each other. I met some old friends and made some new ones. Fariha too met people whom she had so far only known by their names and DPs on Twitter.

The purpose was to create a awareness about ICT & VAW and the implications of various government policies on women. Spearheading the organizational task of putting this event together in Lahore was Advocate Nighat Dad, who is also part of the project team.\n\nI must admit that I had doubts about the number of lawyers who would show up but our superwoman Advocate Nigi (as Fariha referred to her in her presentation) did a tremendously effective job of getting about 80 lawyers from the Lahore High Court, media and a couple of educationalists to this extremely important session. The Honourable Justice (Retired) Nasira Iqbal who is the President of the Lahore High Court Bar Association was the Guest of Honour. Retired Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court the Honourable Mian Allah\u00a0Nawaz was the Chief Guest.\n\nThe session started with a Welcome address and an overview of the MDG3 Project from Sh ahzad Ahmad, B4A Pakistan. He explained in very clear and coincise terms why, who and what the project was about. He explained that is was an APC Women\u2019s Networking Supoort Programme which is being financed through a grant from the MDG3 Fund: Investing in Equality and is being implemented in 12 countries including Pakistan. The project, Shahzad explained, included conducting research and analysis on policy issues related to women\u2019s right and ICTs; promoting women\u2019s engagement in ICT policy spaces that impact on women\u2019s right and gender equality, designing and implementing ICT-enabled interventions, localizing the annual Take Back the Tech campaign and administering small grants for women\u2019s ICT development projects.\n\nThen I made a presentation on the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Ordinance (PECO) and its possible impact on women if the Ordinance was not redrafted. I pointed out the problems with the definitions, the excessive powers given to agencies, the lack of protection built in for individuals and businesses and the lack of any chain of custody and judicial oversight. In addition, I also pointed out that there was no way that, in its current form, this legislation would be effective. I also pointed that that some parts of the Ordinance were actually in contravention of Articles 13, Article 19 and 24 of the Constitution. I asked the legal community to get involved, to join hands with civil society, with women\u2019s rights organisations and with business to ensure that any legislation that was drafted protected the citizens as well as the State.\n\nIn her presentation, young Fariha Akhtar gave an overview of how technology was a great enabler for women and women\u2019s rights organisations as well as opening up ways and means for criminals and perpetrators to further harrass women and girls thus adding to the violence that already existed. She spoke about the Take Back the Tech campaign which was meant to create an awareness of VAW and ICT. Pakistan this year has been an active part of this global campaign and Fariha explained how we had engaged the media, bloggers, tweeples and women\u2019s organizations to spread the word regarding TBTT. This included producing postcards, writing blog posts, articles in magazines, press conferences, interviews with electronic media, using Facebook, Youtube and Twitter to disseminate information about how to keep yourself safe online.\n\nThe Q&A session that followed was very interactive. Many of the young lawyers \u2013 mostly women \u2013 had lots of questions and suggestions and seemed extremely enthusiastic about collaborating with us on policy.\n\nFormer Chief Justice (Retired) Mian Allah\u00a0Nawaz addressed the gathering and said that\u00a0 technology while being highly useful and empowering, can be at the same time highly dangerous as well. He said technology can facilitate and distract. Lawyers, he said, must be aware of\u00a0 the \u201cdeviant behaviour of cyber technology\u201d. Laws, he said, cyber or otherwise, should be made through debative, argumentative and counter argumentative procedures.\n\nJustice (Retd) Nasira Iqbal suggested the formation of a Technical Committee at the Lahore High Court Bar Association l which could assist in assessing and offering analysis of cyber laws and laws that affect women. She also requested P@SHA and B4A to organize training sessions at the Judicial Academy.\n\nSome of the lawyers suggested that we should hold TBTT awareness sessions at schools and colleges and they volunteered to collaborate with us as did some of the educational institution representatives who were present.\n\nAll is all a great and invigorating event that will lead to the legal community, the IT community and civil society joining hands to help the government to come up with policies that are effective for the country and yet do not infringe on citizen rights.\n\nHere is the link to Fariha\u2019s presentation: TBTT Storytelling session with lawyers in Lahore .\n\nSome of the lawyers who were present at the event.\n\nNighat and Fariha putting together the collateral and the documents in the TBTT bags.\n\nA picture of the bags and stickers.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "B4A and P@SHA host VAW & ICT event for legal\u00a0community"},

Well, the man has changed gear and as of today, has taken on the challenging position of Managing Director, Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) \u2013 a position that has for some reason been lying vacant for the past two years.\n\nThe Secretary, Ministry of IT & Telecom, Mr. Nagibullah Malik, should be congratulated on the selection of such an impressive candidate to fill this post. He must have seen in Imran what many of us who have worked with him, have known for some time \u2013\u00a0 an honest, committed, hardworking and intelligent person with a passion for making a difference. Those of us who have been involved in policy discussions with him know that he has been very vocal about the policy changes that are needed for Pakistan to become a greater player on the world ICT scene.\n\nImran strongly believes in the raw talent that exists in this country and has been known to press the case for small and medium sized companies who need extra support from both the government and the private sector in order to overcome the challenges that they face.\n\nImran is a man of vision. Many of you may remember that as recently as October 14, 2009 at the P@SHA ICT Awards, recognizing the potential of Zayd Enam of MediConnect and Babar Ahmed of Cricket Revolution, he gave the time allocated for the Chairman\u2019s address to these young men so that they could present their innovative ideas and products to the 540 people assembled at the Sheraton in Karachi. His faith in them (as well as the faith of all of us who were inspired by them) was justified when they went on to win the APICTA award and the Runner up award in their respective categories in Melbourne Australia.\n\nImran is an MBA (Finance and Entrepreneurship) from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. He is also an MS (Computer Engineering) from Cornell University and a B.Sc. (Electrical Engineering) from UET, Lahore. He has over 17 years experience working in senior managerial positions in sales, consulting, product management and product development at Oracle, Altera and other hi-tech companies. At Oracle he was recognized for his contribution to the sales and consulting teams and was nominated to Club Excellence on two separate occasions \u2013 an award given only to the top performers in Oracle sales and consulting. Imran has been bit by the entrepreneurial bug and is a serial entrepreneur who has started software companies both in the US and in Pakistan. He has also been teaching\u00a0 entrepreneurship at FAST-NUCES Lahore for the past couple of years.\n\nWhen I interviewed him on IT LOW in April last year, he spoke about a variety of issues (I also put up a post on this blog to coincide with the interview). It will be interesting to have him back on the show after he has settled into his new position, just to see what he thinks can be done from within government.\n\nImran Zia is an amazing chap and his friends and associates, and all of us at P@SHA, believe that his appointment is a good omen for the ICT industry. We all know that Imran will put in 110% into his new role. However, perhaps all of us need to manage our expectations in so far as what, even a person like Imran, will be able to achieve with the limitations of the government framework in which he will find himself. Let us give him a bit of time to settle in, a bit of room to manoeuvre and to understand the lay of the land, before we begin to expect him to perform miracles.\n\nImran, the industry offers you its full support and cooperation. Let us join hands and work together to ensure that the brilliant minds within the Pakistani ICT sector are able to meet their true potential. Good luck Imran Zia. Our prayers and good wishes are with you as you take on this challenging role.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Imran Zia takes over as MD\u00a0PSEB"},

He is able to bring together Human Resource specialists from a variety of organisations to discuss issues related to the development of people who work within these organisations. They get together to share ideas, exchange best practices and develop strategies.\n\nFor the last few years, Azfar has been inviting speakers from the IT industry too because as IT companies have grown, they have started focusing more and more on capacity building, on training and on retention of talent. This year Azfar had included on his panel Al-Karim Hassan, who heads the Global HR development for Etilize, and Badar Khushnood of Google.\n\nWhen he asked me to identify a dynamic speaker from within our industry, I suggested Jawwad Ahmed Farid who, in my opinion, is an amazing speaker. And after his performance yesterday, I think there are many people in the Human Resource community who will agree with me. I capture the presentation on my flip for those who couldn\u2019t be there.\n\n\n\n Some of the people spotted at the Talent Management Conference included Shireen Naqvi from the School of Leadership, Ghalia Naseer from TRG and Hina Mehboob from PixSense. Others from the tech community included Humayun Bashir, Country Manager of IBM Pakistan. Some of the discussions did indeed provide food for thought.\n\nI had to leave early because there was another conference that I had to go to so unfortunately I missed Badar and Al-Karim\u2019s presentations. However, knowing them I am sure they were great.\n\nJawwad\u2019s presentation showed that the individuals who work in the IT sector are bright individuals who want to make a difference, who dare to dream and who are different from the average Joe or Jill.\n\nJawwad has kindly shared a copy of his presentation.\n\n", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Jawwad Ahmed Farid wows the HR\u00a0community"},

Sabeen Mahmud and I were grateful that he had so readily accepted our request to speak to technologists and entrepreneurs in Karachi at such short notice. It just shows how ready Naeem Zafar is to share his experience and his knowledge.\n\nEach time I meet Naeem I am awed by his personality. He has accomplished much in his life, through hard work and his ability to grasp hold of opportunities and run with them.\n\nDespite his achievements, he is a very modest, very approachable, very down-to-earth individual who believes in empowering others through sharing and mentoring. He teaches Entrepreneurship at the Haas School of Business, University of Berkeley, he runs Concordia Ventures, he has written 6 books and is the President of the Organisation of Pakistani Entrepreneurs of North America (OPEN). In addition to all this, he finds the time between semesters, to fly to Pakistan and speak at various fora including several universities across the country.\n\nHaving announced the workshop only a couple of days earlier, we were not sure how many people would turn up but they all came. The room was full of young entrepreneurs and some older ones who were all there to learn how they could bootstrap a business. And learn they did!\n\nThere was nothing complicated in what he suggested. He simply shared how he used various free tools and networks to conduct his business. The Internet, he said, had flattened the world so there was nothing keeping us from starting a business and running it successfully irrespective of which part of the world we were living in. He shared examples of Pakistani youngsters and companies who had done it.\n\nNaeem Zafar showed how he used LinkedIn, Twitter, blogs, websites, Google Adwords and online survey and research tools to run his business, to recruit teams, to collaborate, to expand his network and to market his products online \u2013 most of it for free, most of it at zero cost.\n\nThe one clear message that came through in his talk was that it was available out there but to benefit from it, you had to put in the time and effort to learn, to research, to create content, to use what was available. Of course you had to know where to look and you needed some initial direction to get you started. Naeem\u2019s talk yesterday did just that. Everyone I polled said they had learned something new, something they could use.\n\nAfter the workshop Naeem was surrounded. People put specific questions to him. I listened in to some of the queries and the advice he gave. He was honest, he was forthright, he made suggestions, ga ve advice, cleared up misconceptions and set several of them on the right track. Thank you Naeem \u2013 from P@SHA, from TiE Karachi and from all the people whose lives you touched yesterday. Thank you for sharing, thank you for caring enough about entrepreneurship in this country, thank you for taking the time. May God bless you.\n\nThe networking continued well beyond the allotted time of the workshop as people ordered coffee and sandwiches and cupcakes and cheese twisties and stuck around chatting and sharing.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Ultrabootstrapping the \u2018Naeem Zafar\u2019\u00a0way!"},

Within hours we had about 50 people registered. This is when I started to get nervous.\n\nWe had decided to hold the event at T2F because it offers a much friendly atmosphere than a cold hotel room. The space at T2F can accommodate upto 100 people for a seminar/workshop style event (and 250 people butt-to-butt for OpenMic sessions :)).\n\nIn two days the registrations had crossed 100. We decided to cap them at 110 expecting dropouts of about 20% \u2013 which usually happens when people register online for an event.\n\nBut we were wrong. 108 people registered and over 100 showed up. Must be Badar Khushnood\u2019s charisma that drew them to T2F or perhaps it was the sandwiches and cupcakes! Even people like Rahim Lalani of TRG Tech and Munir Usman of Pi Labs showed up before 10.30 a.m. :)\n\nBadar is a fountain of knowledge regarding Google Business Tools and various Google Apps. In 3 hours he took us through a journey which started with some statistics regarding the internet landscape. He said that out of the 1.4 Billion users of the internet, 18 million were Pakistanis. That is only 11% of our population. Our mobile growth\u00a0 is amongst the top 3 or 4 in the world, he said. According to Badar, 77% of the internet users search daily while 38% users search 4 or more times a day.\n\nParticipants were given a taste of Google Insights, Google Trends, Google Adwords, Google News and various other Google Business Solutions. Badar showed how easy it was to use these tools to market products and services online.\n\nHe also showed some of the common mistakes that were being made by webmasters. While checking out the P@SHA website some problems were spotted that may affect its effectiveness as a marketing tool for the Pakistan IT industry. Naturally the issues will be taken care of. :)\n\nThe audience at the workshop was amazing. They were thoroughly engaged from the get-go, asking questions, challenging some of information, digging deep into the usage of some of the tools. Some of them were extremely knowledgeable but a snap survey that I carried out on the spot, indicates that whoever attended the workshop went away feeling that they had learnt something new, something they would be able to apply to their businesses. Many of the participants also asked when we would be running the next advanced workshop \u2013 or actually the demand was for a series of workshops which would cover in detail each of the tools. A calendar is being worked on and these will be announced but first we have to be run this particular workshop in Lahore and Islamabad. Maybe we should run a workshop for government employees, the MNAs, MPAs and the ministers Badar. :)\n\nSome of the questions at the workshop focused on Search Engine Optimization and effective ways to brand a product or service. Badar pointed out that fresh and relevant content is very important for a web presence or any kind of online strategy. Using the correct terminology, making sure that one did not misrepresent oneself or one\u2019s company, was essential.\n\nDr. Irfan Ahmed, Director of Sales for the Middle East, Africa and Pakistan, was also present at the workshop and added value by sharing some of his experiences with customers in Pakistan.\n\nThe lunch session was as much of an opportunity for participants to interact with Badar, as it was for them to network amongst themselves. The conversation seemed centered around online marketing though.\n\nI suspect some deals were also in the offing but I couldn\u2019t really discuss the details (even if they had been shared with me). And a lawyer was also spotted in the audience. Wonder what he was doing there ;).\n\nOverall the workshop was very productive for all attendees. We will be on the road to Lahore soon to run something similar.\n\nOur thanks to Badar for a very interesting workshop and to CIO Pakistan for covering the event. And to the team at T2F especially Mariam Bilgrami, thanks for the wonderful arrangements and the delicious sandwiches and cupcakes.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "An effective marketing\u00a0exercise"},

Pakistan (represented by P@SHA) is one of the 23 economies who are members of ASOCIO.\n\nCollaboration can play a key role, helping countries in the region build on collective strengths and overcome shortcomings, to grow faster than they would expect to grow in isolation.\n\nThe Vision 2020 report identifies the specific challenges that each of the member economies must address in order to realise the benefits on offer.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "ASOCIO launches Vision\u00a02020"},

She was the kindest of souls, the most unselfish person I have ever known or will ever know; she was a happy individual despite having had quite a tough childhood; she always saw the best in everyone and would somehow look deep beneath the surface to find something good about whoever she met. If someone did something to hurt her or cause her pain, she would find an excuse for that person\u2019s behaviour and would instantly forgive them.\n\nAnd as for us, her immediately family, we were her life. Being around us was what made her happy. She didn\u2019t need anything else. Whenever any of us asked her what we could get for her from whichever city we travelled to, she would say she didn\u2019t need anything, that she had everything she could ever want.\n\nAmmi had a wonderful sense of humour and a ready smile that could cheer you up on the dreariest of days. Although she was always there as a mother to cater to our every need, physical or emotional, as we were growing up, she was at the same time a friend, a buddy, a confidante \u2013 someone you could say anything to without the fear of being judged.\n\nShe taught us to find joy in the smallest things. She taught us what unselfish love truly is. She showed us through example how being gentle, kind, compassionate and generous with ones feelings was the best way to live ones life. Her heart cried for the sufferings of humanity \u2013 war, disease, poverty \u2013 and if she could have, she would have alleviated all the pain she saw around her.\n\nToday as we mark the day of her birth, I try and focus on all the happy times, all the cherished memories that she helped create so effortlessly, all the moments spent in the warmth of her love.\n\nAnd I remember again how Ammi and Abbaji always celebrated their birthdays together (or at least we insisted on a celebration). So at midnight on January 5, they would both cut one cake and we would sing Happy Birthday, and then they would open their presents and complain about the money we had \u201cwasted\u201d on everything. They didn\u2019t really need anything, they said. I guess that is the way parents are. They work hard to give their kids everything they could possibly need or want, but when it comes to their own needs and desires, they consider it unimportant and unnecessary.\n\nHappy Birthday Ammi. We love you and miss you so much. You were the best mama in the world and we hope we remembered to tell you often enough how special you were and what a difference you made to our lives. On this, your special day, I hope you are having a whale of a party up in the heavens. We feel your absence every moment of every day but we continue to feel your presence in whatever we do. We know you\u00a0 watch over us from the heavens even now and the memory of your smile and the sound of your laughter, still warms our hearts.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Happy birthday darling\u00a0Ammi"},

On my best day I don\u2019t have a good singing voice and can\u2019t ever hold a tune, but early in the morning it must have been torturous :). Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have done that to him.\n\nAs he does every year, he told me that this was not his \u201creal\u201d birthday. What he meant by that was that when he was born, no one actually recorded births. The only indication of when exactly my father was born came from my Dadi (paternal grandmother). She said the weather was cool, the sun shone beautifully in the sky and the birds sang happily in the trees. Not quite enough information for us to really figure out his date of birth.\n\nAnyway, when he went to school and college, he had to have a date of birth for the record. And subsequently he got a driving license and finally a passport so the date that was used on all his documents and official records is the one that we accept as his official date of birth.\n\nEach year he tells us that it isn\u2019t really his birthday but each year he is happy that we have bothered to remember and to celebrate.\n\nMy brothers and my sister all phoned him today \u2013 not once but several times \u2013 to let him know that they were thinking of him. I prepared a special food hamper for him of things he likes to eat and drink \u2013 a jar of honey, muesli, chocolate coated raisins, honey coated cashews and peanuts, ribena, raspberry cookies, rich tea biscuits, oreo biscuits, cheese \u2013 and I bought him a Levi\u2019s shirt, trouser and a pair of socks.\n\nI had wanted to take his friends and him for high tea to the Boat Club but he wasn\u2019t feeling up to it. So we had a nice meal prepared at home and some members of the family joined us for a pleasant dinner and the chocolate caramel cake and trifle.\n\nMuch as Abbaji may protest the efforts we put into celebrating his birthday each year, he loves being fussed over. Who doesn\u2019t? Happy birthday Abbaji. May you be with us for a long long time. Aameen.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Happy Birthday Dearest\u00a0Abbaji"},

However, this time at the Asia Pacific ICT Awards and ASOCIO General Assembly & ICT Summit in Melbourne, I considered whether I was perhaps wearing too many hats simultaneously.\n\nI was juggling the following responsibilities:\n\n1. Economy Coordinator for Pakistan for APICTA\n\n 2. EXCO member for Pakistan for APICTA\n\n 3. EXCO member for Pakistan for ASOCIO\n\n 4. Executive Director for Pakistan for ASOCIO\n\n 5. Roving reporter for iP@SHA, CIO Pakistan Webstudio and for my own blog\n\nWhat did all this mean? Well, there was the ASOCIO General Assembly and ICT Summit to attend and participate in, the ASOCIO ED\u2019s meeting to share our annual programs and statistics with, the APICTA Economy Coordinator\u2019s meeting and the APICTA Exco meeting. In addition, I had to be available to the delegates from Pakistan and to both the ASOCIO and APICTA secretariats in case there were any queries that came up. The judges from Pakistan had their hands full with the judging schedule and the mentoring.\n\nWhen Sultan Hamdani asked me why I wasn\u2019t accompanying the rest of the team for a day\u2019s outing to take in the blue-green ocean and the beautiful Australian countryside, for a few seconds I wondered if it was a serious question. I have a suspicion that he was teasing me because he knew well that I had several meetings to attend. But it got me th inking. Each time I make an official business trip, I end up working twice as hard as I do when I am home. And of course there is always the game of catch-up that one has to play when one returns home. There is definitely something wrong with this picture, don\u2019t you think? And yet i thrive on it. Must be the great food and the company of friends from ASOCIO and APICTA whom we have come to know and cherish over the last 6-7 years. Each time we meet it is like a reunion.

I am not referring to the Cantonese that I picked up while I was living there, but to things I have been able to apply throughout my life \u2013 energy, diligence, respect for hard work, attention to detail, value of time and the ability to enjoy life to the fullest.\n\nAs I walked around Hong Kong I felt a renewed energy, a renewed sense of urgency to get things done. I could feel the energy all around me \u2013 people walking at a pace that you rarely see anywhere else. And the sea of humanity that I saw as I emerged from the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) in downtown Causeway Bay, was unique even for Hong Kong. I tried to take a picture to capture that moment in time.\n\nIt is a wonder people don\u2019t get trampled in crowds such as this.\n\nI somehow managed to squeeze my way out into a less crowded place and found myself standing in front of Christmas carolers. I thought to myself that the tune of the carol sounded familiar but the words didn\u2019t. And it was then that I realized that it was \u201cSilent Night\u201d being sung in Mandarin! :)\n\nIt attracted some families and young couples who stood holding hands and moving to the tune of the music. Quite serene. Brought a smile to my face as I stood there taking it all in.\n\nI strolled along and window shopped with nothing specific in mind that I wanted to buy, and whiled away the time until I met my brother for dinner. That was another experience and a half. I had fussed and told told him I was not interested in going for a buffet. I would rather go to one of the small restaurants in the city that were favourites of mine. But he insisted and so I agreed.\n\nIt turned out to be a good decision in the end because in the buffet were some of my favourite things \u2013 sushi, crab, fishball and tofu soup, steamed fish in soya, etc. And amongst the deserts they had chocolate fondue, bread and butter pudding, fresh crepes with whatever filling you wanted, waffles with ice cream and loads of other stuff. I am sure I am adding on a few pounds as I remember the spread. :) It was a nice evening. I was tired after a long and activity filled day but I was happy that I had managed to do so much in such a short period of time.

I was supposed to be there but loads of things conspired to keep me from Lahore today. But hey guys I will be there in spirit. :)\n\nGoogle Map Maker [ http://mapmaker.google.com/ ] is an open editing tool for Google Maps that has resulted in the mapping of streets, businesses, restaurants, hospitals, clinics and other venues in Pakistan. It is mainly community driven and people who know their districts and locales well, have started \u201cmapping\u201d them so that anyone wanting to get from \u201canywhere to anywhere\u201d, in a particular city, town or district can do so with the help of these digital maps. This has become even more useful as the number of mobile phone subscribers heads towards the 100 million mark in Pakistan.\n\nAccording to Badar Khushnood, the Pakistan Consultant for Google Inc, the Google Mapping Party is being held to take stock of what has been accomplished so far, and to highlight the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nThe announcement for the event, which has been organized by the FAST Lahore ACM chapter, in collaboration with Google (P@SHA is supporting the event of course), is indeed tempting. This is what it states:\n\n * Interact with the Google Map Maker Community of Pakistan\n\n * Take part in a mapping workshop with Google Map Maker led by top mappers\n\n * Brainstorm with technologists, bloggers and urban activists on technology and its role in urban development.\n\n * Mingle with like-minded people over tea, and share your ideas.\n\nThey also share an example and ask you to look at http://bit.ly/mapmaker-lahore to see Lahore\u2019s map on Google Maps and to see how Badshahi Mosque\u2019s neighborhood has been mapped http://bit.ly/badshahi-mosque-mapmaker\n\nLots of youngsters have registered for the event. Amongst them will be two young Pakistanis from the UK \u2013 Faraz Ahmad who is a 26 year old programmer living in Glasgow and Jabran Rafique who is an IT Administrator. These young men live 400 miles apart and have never met but, between them, have been responsible for over 70,000 map edits on Google Map Maker since they started using it in 2008 soon after the application was launched.\n\nAccording to a New York times article published in mid November, Faraz is the top contributor to Google Map Maker having logged more than 41,000 changes. They have also been featured in a post on the Google blog.\n\nWhy did they start on this journey? Simple. Like many other people in the UK, they use Google Maps extensively to get around and they felt that the lack of definitive maps in Pakistan, deprived Pakistanis\u00a0 from availing of the convenience of digital maps. So they formed a virtual team online and started on a mission to map Pakistan. Wow! That is the spirit guys.\n\nThey started with their own home towns and places they know well personally \u2013 adding roads, streets, schools, hospitals, grounds, coffee shops, restaurants, government offices, banks, tourist sites, etc \u2013 and the maps started taking shape. Whenever they met people from other districts, towns or cities, they would sit them down, open up Google Map Maker and get them to identify their locales in detail, adding these edits and thus mapping more areas.\n\nFaraz and Jibran have also been assisting other young people in Pakistan to learn how to use Map Maker and add and edit maps. They will share their experience at the Google Mapping Party in Lahore and I really wish I could have met them and spoken to them in person. If you are in Lahore and can be there, do not miss this opportunity.\n\nHowever, please note that you MUST REGISTER at http://bit.ly/google-mapping-party to be allowed onto the FAST campus.\n\nHave fun mappers! We will follow you online. Badar has promised that he will try and livestream the event.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Google Mapping Party at FAST-NUCES Lahore\u00a0today"},

In pursuit of knowledge, he went for his undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering to the University of Minnesota. He remembers having to clean toilets to cover some of his costs at college \u2013 certainly very different from the comfortable life he led playing cricket in the afternoon on the streets of Islamabad.\n\nFresh out of college, he founded eBot, an email management company, which he sold to a major computer software provider in Minnesota. He then spent 4 years developing and driving innovative strategies as VP Marketing and Business Development for a couple of computer software organisations in the US until the entrepreneurial bug bit him again and he co-founded Gravitywell which was very quickly swallowed up by the bubble burst in 2001.\n\nThe next venture, Chegg Inc., was inspired by Osman Rashid and Aayush Phumbhra\u2019s frustration with the policies and procedures of their own university\u2019s bookstore. They knew there had to be a better solution \u2013 one that worked for students, professors and publishers alike. Since its launch Chegg has grown 25 times its original size. Chegg\u2019s purpose is simple: Students don\u2019t need to purchase textbooks; they just rent them.\n\nChegg was launched at Iowa State University in 2005 as a \u201chyper-local\u201d classifieds directory. In the fall of 2007, Chegg introduced its revolutionary textbook rental service. It now offers its services to more than 6,400 universities and community colleges across the country.\n\nAccording to the company website, Chegg lets students rent as many textbooks as they like with just a few clicks. Books are delivered in less than a week. Renting textbooks through Chegg not only saves students\u00a0 50-70% off the cost of buying new or used books, it also eliminates the hassle of waiting in long lines at the bookstore. Not only do students and their parents save money and time, they also help preserve the environment.\n\nYet again we see a simple idea born out of a need and executed well. Modeled after online movie rental pioneer Netflix, to date Chegg has saved students $83,967,896.38 in textbook purchases \u2013 and the ticker continues to tick every second. Because the concept is so easy to understand, makes great sense and has made money from Day 1, Chegg has managed to raise more than $84 million in four rounds of venture funding, and $55 million in credit and debt facility, since it started four years ago.\n\nNow Techcrunch has revealed that Osman Rashid has been working on a stealth startup by the name of Kakai which already has 40 employees and has raised Series A and B Funding to the tune of US$9.35 million.\n\nTechcrunch\u2019s Jason Kincaid further tells us that:\n\nVery little is known about Kakai at this point. It was cofounded by Rashid and engineer Babur Habib, who has spent time working on both semiconductors and software at Intel, Philips, and Exponent. The company has been rumored to have something to do with electronic readers, but all reports are vague. I did manage to dig up the following from an old job listing, which seems to be in line with those rumors:\n\n \u201cKakai is a stealth-mode start-up developing an innovative Linux-based, portable consumer electronics product (details available through non-disclosure agreement).\u201d Rashid isn\u2019t talking. He does say, though, that we\u2019ll likely be hearing much more from the company come late March. He also says the 40 person company is actively hiring top technical talent.\n\nI would like to thank Mohtashim of IT Taazee for bringing Osman\u2019s story to my attention. It always warms my heart to see young people from Pakistan really make it out there in the big bad world of commerce.\n\nIn one of his interviews, Osman is known to have credited his parents for the person he is today. As a child, his father used to encourage him to think out of the box \u2013 to create new designs with construction sets instead of the ones that came with the toy kit. As for his spirit, he says he inherited that from his mother who brought up seven kids and yet climbed trees when the need arose.\n\nOsman Rashid has won the Ernst & Young 2009 Entrepreneur of the Year Award. Hip hip hurray for him. Well done Osman. We are all proud of your achievements. Keep it up.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Osman Rashid named 2009 E&Y Entrepreneur of the\u00a0Year"},

And so was born the idea of iP@SHA.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have to go far to implement the idea. Dr. Umar Saif and Adil Saleem, two members of the SeenReport team, were visiting Karachi so I asked them what it would take to add a P@SHA community channel to SeenReport. This is something I had discussed over dinner in Lahore with Sharjeel Ahmed Qureshi, Yaser Awan and Adil some months earlier and they had volunteered to set it up for P@SHA whenever we decided it was time. Of course the idea didn\u2019t really take root until Yusuf brought it up during our first 2010 planning meeting. He even had a tagline for it \u201ciP@SHA \u2013 Do you?\u201d :)\n\nWe have just launched the Community Channel and although so far it only contains a bunch of videos that I have put up, I am hoping that as more people find out about the space, they will start using it. If young startups or freelancers want to put up their startup videos for feedback, this would be an ideal spot for them to do so. If you hear of something innovative that someone is doing in the ICT space, take a video or a photo and put it up. If you have an idea you want to share that needs collaborative input, put it up with a request. If you have a demo of your product that you want to share, post it. Let us make this a collaborative space, a space where we build a community that actually lives up to the \u201call for one and one for all\u201d concept.\n\nGo and check out iP@SHA now, register and start submitting news, announcements, pictures and videos.\n\nHow do you submit an item to iP@SHA?\n\n Email/MMS pictures and videos with description to:\n\n ipasha@seenreport.com\n\n or \n\n ipasha.cityname@seenreport.com\n\nThank you Umar, Sharjeel, Adil and Yaser for helping us make this happen.

My favourite subjects were Maths, Chemistry, History and English, and because I found these subjects interesting, I was good at them. I think I would have enjoyed Physics and Geography too but for the teachers I had, who were never able to bring the subjects to life for me.\n\nWhen the announcement was made that the first event at T2F 2.0 would be Science ka Adda: Humans in the Cosmos, I wondered if it would make any sense to me at all. I have always been fascinated by the moon, the stars and the planets but am not too knowledgeable about them (or at least I wasn\u2019t until last night). This being the International Year of Astronomy, the subject of the talk was certainly very relevant.\n\nSalman Hameed, who is an astronomer and Assistant Professor of Integrated Science and Humanities at Hampshire College, Massachusetts, was the speaker.\n\nHis passion and enthusiasm for the subject made it come alive for even those of us who were total novices. If he had been my teacher, I would probably have been walking around with a telescope throughout my school and college years.\n\nAs Salman took us through a journey of the history of the telescope and how it had changed fundamental perceptions about humanity and its place in the universe, I found myself carried off into the world of planets and stars and the Milky Way.\n\nAs Salman highlighted key discoveries, from Galileo and Herschel to the Palomar Observatory and the current Hubble Space Telescope, and explained the imperfections in the universe, and talked about\u00a0\u00a0 a universe consisting of hundreds of billions of galaxies, with the earth simply being a speck in the entire scheme of things, it humbled us all.\n\nI was amazed to see how well attended the event was. There were people of all ages from as young as 10 I think to as old as someone in their eighties. It showed the diversity of audiences that T2F and discourses such as these are able to attract, and also perhaps the dearth of such intellectual activity in a city full of people starving for knowledge.\n\nThe audience listened with rapt attention to a speaker whose interest in his own subject was obvious as his eyes sparkled when he spoke about the discoveries of Jupiter and Uranus and the earth\u2019s position with relation to the Sun, and the billions of stars that were out there that were not visible to the naked eye. However, what I was not prepared for were the number of relevant and knowledgeable questions that were put to Salman at the end of his talk.\n\nFrom the youngster who asked about the Hubble telescope being possibly taken down to complicated questions about the position of starts billions of light years away, it showed the calibre or the people who had come to attend the talk. I was totally blown away by the level of interest in the subject.\n\nThe discourse continued until suddenly a huge telescope was produced and some of the enthusiasts moved outside with Salman to view the stars and make it all even more real and alive. A brilliant beginning to the new T2F. I hope to attend many more events at the new venue. Hope to see all of you there.\n\nI just noticed that Salman has put up a detailed post regarding the lectures he has given in Pakistan, especially the one he gave at T2F and how it was different from the one he gave at Aga Khan University and the Quaid-e-Azam University.

The ground floor is the Exhibition and Events area \u2013 spacious yet welcoming.\n\nThen there are the books \u2013 one shelf that is dedicated to books from Liberty Books and another for Urdu books. There are T2F mugs for sale too for those who really must take T2F home with them. :)\n\nThere is a Pedro Myers exhibition on at the moment and that has added a lot of ambience to an already warm and lovely atmosphere.\n\nI can definitely foresee holding a lot of TakeBacktheTech and Startup Insiders sessions in this new space.

She is the most pleasant person I have met in a long time.\n\nFor those who loved the old mural, there is a small replica to bring back the memories of T2F 1.0. And it certainly fits in well with the new decor.\n\nThere is a conference room that has a table the likes of which you wouldn\u2019t believe. It is a real original. I am mentally beating myself for not having taken a picture of it yesterday.\n\nThere is a space for five entrepreneurs who are just starting up \u2013 a table each, with a couple of drawers and a cabinet. Already heavily in demand, I expect the five spots will be taken up before you know it.\n\nThere is a balcony area for those who just have to smoke. At least that means the rest of us don\u2019t have to worry about passive smoke which is something that worries me about being in restaurants and coffee shops where this \u2018no-smoking indoors\u2019 rule is not implemented.\n\nOh yes and don\u2019t miss the Jim Morrison wall in the washroom \u2013 it will definitely make you smile.\n\nCome on, haven\u2019t I tempted you enough? You just have to go see the place \u2026 and revisit it as often as you can.

I also look at the whole issue of privacy from an advocacy perspective because I believe many people do not even think about the privacy angle until they become a target of privacy invasion or a victim of online harrassment or cyberstalking. Governments too need to be monitored so they do not come up with policies under the guise of security that infringe on our privacy.

He dazzled us at the P@SHA Tech Crunch Gong Award. He won the hearts of the judges and attendees at the P@SHA ICT Awards. And then we brought him with us to the Asia Pacific ICT Awards (APICTA) in Melbourne Australia to present his project in the Secondary School Student category. And he has done it again! In the words of one of the judges on the judging panel in his category \u201cHe is Pakistan\u2019s future Bill Gates \u2013 he was the clear winner from the start \u2013 way ahead of anyone else who presented in the category. There was no doubt that he was the winner\u201d. Can you imagine how great it felt to hear that? I did however clear him up on the fact that Zayd had already been tagged in Pakistan as a young Steve Jobs ;), so Bill Gates would have to wait in line.\n\nAs I write this post, no-one in the Pakistani delegation \u2013 not even Zayd or judges Zafar and Sultan \u2013 are aware of the fact that young Zayd has won the APICTA Award in the Secondary School Student category. In the Head Judges\u2019 Briefing and the EXCO endorsement meeting, Zayd was specifically mentioned as being a unique young man who had shown himself to be different from any young person his age who had ever presented at APICTA.\n\nZayd\u2019s journey to this APICTA win is worth mentioning. When he won the P@SHA Tech Crunch Gong Award & the P@SHA ICT Award, he was thrilled but not complacent. P@SHA had never brought a Secondary School Student to APICTA but Chairman Yusuf Jan, CEC members Imran Zia, Jawwad Farid, Zafar Khan, Sultan Hamdani and I all agreed that it would be a great idea to start introducing younger participants at these regional events especially if they were as talented as Zayd.\n\nOnce we had informed Zayd of this decision, Jawwad Ahmed Farid took over the task of mentoring him and preparing him for his participation & presentation at APICTA. And Zayd obviously listened intently and followed the advice offered to him. Once he arrived in Melbourne, Zafar Khan and Sultan Hamdani took him under their wing and continued the mentoring. I helped a wee bit too.\n\nBut it was Zayd\u2019s own commitment that has got him to this stage. I saw him work painstakingly on his presentation until the very last moment. He presented to as many of us as would listen, as many times as we would listen. Pictures and videos were added, it was rehearsed, it was fine-tuned again and again. I was very impressed to see the amount of work this young man put into the exercise. He took the task extremely seriously.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just the presentation he was concerned about. Many of us business people can learn\u00a0 how to \u2018work\u2019 an event from this young man. He networked with many individuals, was curious about the product displays and had discussions with as many attendees as he was able to. It was a delight to see him network. One of the Malaysian health sector companies who heard about him, actually approached him and offered him an internship :) but Zayd doesn\u2019t like the concept of internships. And why does he even need it? He is already an entrepreneur working on a startup in the social sector.\n\nWe have had APICTA wins in the past and we have been very proud of our companies\u2019 achievements but there is something special about this win and definitely something very special about this young man. We will continue to support him in any way we can. There is no doubt in our minds that Zayd Enam will continue to make Pakistan proud and he is certainly someone we should all continue to watch. Well done Zayd! Way to go! We are extremely proud of you.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Zayd Enam dazzles the regional ICT\u00a0sector!"},

He is so frail and I know for him each day I am away, must stretch into lonely long hours.\n\nAnyway, I made him promise to look after himself, said goodbye and left for the airport probably a little earlier than I should have. I don\u2019t like last minute rushed departures which only tend to harrass.\n\nI got to the airport at 9.45. My flight was not until 12.25. I had my laptop so I sat down and did some work until Adnan Agboatwalla and Faraz Hoodbhoy arrived. The Pixsense co-founders were headed for Manila, Jakarta and Singapore and were on the flight with me all the way to Hong Kong.\n\nAdnan did not endear himself with me too much by teasing me about the iPhone not being my primary vehicle of communication. Faraz, however, was extremely helpful by opening up the mini pharmacy that he travels with and providing me with some pills to help ease my cough and cold.\n\nOnce we got on the flight, I made a boo-boo that I will not repeat any time soon. When the stewardess pleasantly asked how I was feeling, I told her that I was not too well. She appeared to be very concerned and asked what was wrong. I told her I had a throat infection that was driving me insane.\n\nNext thing I knew several of the other stewardesses and the purser came over and enquired into my welfare. I must admit I was impressed by the level of attention and concern. It was only when one of the senior people from Cathay Pacific\u2019s ground staff came and sat down and spoke to me in Urdu, that I realized that they were less concerned about me and more about the germs I might be carrying. Apparently word regarding my throat infection had been shared with the cockpit team and they were wondering if I had the H1N1 virus. I quickly assured them that this was just an allergic reaction and I had no fever or other symptoms of the swine flu.\n\nHowever, throughout the flight, I received a great deal of constant attention. By the time I landed in Hong Kong I had drugged myself sufficiently so that the flu sensors didn\u2019t detect my cold and cough. I was successful in my attempts at deceit and so I was able to exit through immigration without any problem. I was stopped at Customs though. The chappie was curious to see that I was only carrying my laptop and purse and had no luggage. He asked why I was travelling light.\n\nWhen I told him I was only there for 7 hours and would be proceeding to Melbourne that evening, he looked at me suspiciously. It was only when I pulled out my HK ID card that he smiled and said \u201cOh you are a resident. Go ahead.\u201d\n\nIn Hong Kong I was able to mee t with my brother by taking the Airport Express \u2013 an amazing train that takes one into the city in 20-25 mins. We had coffee and also roamed in the Tsimtsatsui area and I bought a light nylon jersey. One of the things that my brother pointed out were the long queues outside shops like Louis Vuitton and Chanel. These, he said, were tourists from Mainland China. Shows the strength of the Chinese economy.\n\nThen I headed back to the airport prior to which my brother insisted th at I check out the humongous Elements Mall at the Kowloon train terminal. I am glad he suggested it because there was a free open air concert taking place in the atrium of the Elements mall that I was able to catch \u2013 nice, happy and fun environment. It was also a good photo opportunity.\n\nStrange thing about landing in Hong Kong is that I always find myself not only walking with a spring in my step, but also find that I don\u2019t notice the pain in my knees that has been consistent for the past six months.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2009/11/28/we-need-to-take-back-the-tech-now/", "text": "When ICT and VAW (Violence against Women) were mentioned to me in one breath for the first time, I didn\u2019t immediately see the connection between the two. I guess part of me has always spent a lot of time defending the Internet and communication technologies and that is why I am very quick to react to any suggestion of technology being related to anything negative, or being made to appear to be a threat as opposed to an enabler and an equalizer.\n\nHowever, being a person who usually gives anything new a fair hearing before making any sort of judgement, I listened. And as I listened, I realized what I had missed, the things I had failed to connect. What the members of the Association of Progressive Communications (APC) Women\u2019s Networking Support Program said made total sense and my eyes lit up as I began to understand what they were trying to do, what they were in fact advocating.\n\nUnequal power in gender relations has always been central to the issue of Violence against Women. Men (or women) who indulge in violence are trying to prove their physical superiority over, or control of, another human being. Of course that doesn\u2019t make them superior. In fact it probably stems from a feeling of inferiority and the need to prove otherwise. However it gives them the false pretension of have power over the person they are victimizing resulting in that person\u2019s individual rights and liberties being impinged.\n\nSo how does that translate into violence using ICTs? The same crimes that exist in the real world also exist in the online or virtual world \u2013 cyberstalking, harrassment using email, SMSes, chat, online messengers and other tools. These methods have been known to be used to harrass and cause psychological trauma in women and children as well as to be a source of threat to their privacy and confidentiality. Then there is the increasing instance of pornography and human trafficking using a faster more accessible medium. Tracking of women using GIS, webcams etc by the perpetrators of voilence, has also been known to happen.\n\nInformation and Communication Technology is of course gender neutral but obstacles such as poor infrastructure, high usage costs, budgetary constraints, psychological barriers, inadequate skills and access have often been cited as some of the reasons for relatively low usage of technology by women. I remember how surprised I was when a young IT professional told me that in his household his sister and his wife were not allowed access to the computer. When I asked why he said that the male members of the family wanted to protect \u201ctheir women\u201d from the threats that existed online. This may appear to be a case of chivalry but what does it result in? It keeps women from using technology for their benefit. It restricts them from accessing all the sources of knowledge that are out there, keeps them from connecting with support networks, from sources of entertainment, the possibility of online work and economic empowerment and basically from being a part of a dynamic and growing global community.\n\nWomen\u2019s organisations and support groups are also slow to adopting and using the ever-growing online medium and social networks to communicate their message and to provide the kind of linkages and support that they so easily could if they could harness a medium that is within their reach.\n\nThere is no question that security is important. But it is possible for women and women\u2019s groups to learn to use these new technologies to their advantage securely. They can use privacy settings and common-sense approaches to keep themselves safe online.\n\nThe mission of this project \u201cTake Back the Tech\u201d is to enable and educate women\u2019s groups, NGOs, support organisations, activists and women themselves to take charge of their lives by grasping the reigns of these technologies and using them for their own empowerment.\n\nWomen need to involve themselves in the development of online multimedia and visual content and online games. They need to be part of privacy advocacy groups and initiatives to ensure that technology and policy is developed keeping gender sensitivities and challenges in focus. The digital divide that exists is not just between the developing and developed world, it is also between genders, also between the digitally literate and the digitally deprived.

ONI is an organisation that promotes and encourages online Freedom of Expression as well as Internet openness.\n\nWhen we first got to the reception we were told by the organisers that there was some delay in the showing of an OpenNet Initiative-Asia documentary, directed by Subasri Krishnan and Namita A. Malhotra, which looks at the dynamics of Internet censorship and surveillance across different parts of Asia and the role that information regulation plays. The reason for the delay was that someone had objected to the fact that Burma and Tibet were mentioned in the flyer that had been circulated regarding this movie.\n\nOnce the permission was finally received for running parts of the documentary, the ONI Asia team was approached by the United Nations (UN) security to take down the banner for a new book that was being launched by ONI called \u201cAccess Controlled\u201d written by Ronald Deibert, John Palfrey, Rafal Rohozinski and Jonathan Zittrainis.\n\nThe poster apparently mentioned China\u2019s famous \u2018Great Firewall of China\u2019 as one of the first national Internet filtering systems\u201d. When ONI Asia refused to take down the banner, the UN Security guard forcibly took it down. This video taken by an ONI Asia member shows what happened.\n\nRonald Deibert, one of the co-authors of the book, and the Director of the Citizen Lab, Munk Centre for International Studies, said in response to this action: \u201cWhat is the point of the IGF if we can\u2019t talk about Freedom of Expression,Privacy & Access Control?\u201d ONI will be writing a formal complaint to the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights about the \u201ccensorship\u201d!", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Censorship at IGF in Sharm el\u00a0Sheikh"},

It is a long hard road rethinking every detail of how you have conducted a successful business thus far, tearing up that strategy, and then working with local and foreign mentors to learn how to accelerate that growth through a new approach.\n\nI had met these companies before, seen their presentations before and could clearly see that they had put in a lot of time to rework their presentations.\n\nI was especially proud of Ali from Ikonami (yes I know how to pronounce the name of the company \u2013 I-kah-naa-me) who had been thrown in the deep end at the last minute because Babar Khan, the country manager, had to whizz to a family emergency.\n\nThis company won a \u00a31.5 million contract from the National Health Service UK for a 5 year term to develop a technical HR framework for the 600 hospitals that are part of the network. The contract was renewed for another 3 years for \u00a31.6 million. They saw an opportunity and developed a performance appraisal and a venue management system application that could be sold to the hospitals in the network in addition to the work they are already doing for the NHS. That opportunity paid off and they have already sold one of those products to about 70 hospitals within the NHS leaving a large number still to tap.\n\nUnderstanding the customer and his needs and providing an answer to that need before the question has even formed in his own mind, is the reason for the success of both the products that were born out of the interaction with the hospitals while implemented the NHS contract.\n\nAli presented the case so clearly, with such confidence and so coincisely that one could definitely see that he shared the vision for the continued growth of his organization. It is a simple story and he presented it without getting us caught up in technical or domain-specific jargon. He also answered the questions the judges posed to him without batting an eyelid. Well done young man! Kubair and Babar should be very proud of you.\n\nHasnain from Aerocar has a successful company that is in a totally different space. He has used his air force engineering know-how and developed kiosks that are rugged, don\u2019t require airconditioning, offer dust protection, are cheaper than anything the competition can ever come up with and run custom-made open source software that makes the entire solution much more affordable especially for banks that are wanting to put these kiosks up in remote areas where heat and dust are a problem.\n\nAlthough his presentation was extremely succinct and showed the strength of the business, the actual competitive value he had created came out when the judges threw some really tough questions at him. He was obviously able to convince the most cynical of judges and was declared the winner of this year\u2019s BAP competition.

I am of course referring to the MITEFP Business Acceleration Plan competition and Conference on Corporate Entrepreneurship that was held on October 13.\n\nHowever, I have only two motivational drivers for doing most things in my professional life:\n\n1. If someone is trying to do something to improve and support the IT sector, provide them with whatever assistance that they ask for\n\n2. If IT entrepreneurs are taking part in an activity, be there to hold their hand and be part of the cheering section So when Dr. Zahir A.

It was a fun session because I had on my panel a bunch of entrepreneurs who are dedicated, motivated people: Jawwad Ahmed Farid, CEO of Alchemy Technologies Yasha and Rabea, Founders of Voizar Yusuf Jan, co-founder of Mixit Technologies Shehzad Qureshi, co-founder of Tohfay.com.\n\nMy brief was that I was to ask them about their BAP experience which I did but we went on to talk about many other things \u2013 for instance what are the continuing challenges that these companies to face and how they are addressing them, what are they growth pains and the lesson learnt, the current investment climate and subsequent valuation issues that they are faced with, how they address the issues of attracting and retaining the most talented technical and business people and Intellectual Property Rights. After our initially allotted time, Sarah Bird (the MC for the evening and the most delightful person I have met in some time) continued to pop in every few minutes to indicate from a distance that we had to keep talking for another 5 minutes. This pushed the initial discussion time to almost twice that which we had been assigned. The audience (or what was left of it at this stage) was so engaged and asked some very relevant questions.

I am speaking of the \u201cPrevention of Electronic Crime Ordinance 2009 (PECO 2009)\u201d.\n\nYes I know we raised a hue and cry over it in 2007 when it was first promulgated by the then President Parvez Musharraf. There was a lot of advocacy done using Youtube, television channels, newspapers and magazines, blogs and meetups. A few minor changes were made to appease us. Then the Ordinance lapsed.\n\nA few months ago the current government reactivated the Ordinance. We raised our voices again and there were assurances that the Ordinance would not be used to suppress freedom of speech or expression.\n\nNow we hear that the Ordinance has been sent to the floor of the National Assembly and there is every possibility of it becoming law. So you can imagine why P@SHA, ISPAK, civil society and business organizations as well as legal experts have joined hands to ask that the Ordinance be repealed and focus group sessions started to determine what kind of Cyber Crime Act is needed for the benefit of the country and its people.\n\nP@SHA organized a Press Conference a few days ago. Here is a video of that conference. Barrister Zahid Jamil who has been a part of this advocacy since its early days, Sabeen Mahmud of T2F (representing civil society) and Nadeem Farooqui GM Legal of Cybernet (representing ISPAK) were present at the Press Conference.\n\nAttached is a video of the conference which is mainly in Urdu.\n\nLinks to presentations and videos of the advocacy campaign that started in 2007 will be put up this afternoon. If you have any links of clippings or videos, please send them to us so they can all be available in one place.\n\nThe good news is that PM Yousuf Raza Geelani expressed reservations regarding the Ordinance in Parliament a couple of days ago.

He decided to switch the delivery of his presentation. He said he would speak for 10 minutes and leave 20 minutes for Q&A.\n\nHe highlighted a few points in his talk:\n\n1. The conventional thought that you should first join a large corporate, get some experience and then start your own business, was a myth. He said there was no way that join a thousand people organisation would teach you how to run your own business.\n\n2. When you are making some critical assumptions on which the success of your business is dependent, even if you have made one assumption incorrectly, the whole building can crumble and you are left with a failure staring you in the face. A strong combination of passion and intellect is needed. The mind needs to guide the heart. You must challenge any numbers, anything that looks too good to be true.\n\n3. A lot of people go to bookshops to buy self-help books to learn how to be an entrepreneur, how to be a good leader, etc etc. No matter how good he is, reading Jack Welch will not inspire you to be an entrepreneur. If you want inspiration you have to refer to literature, history, war, sports, poetry, maybe religion. It is different for different people. However it will not come from management courses or business school.\n\nAsad Umar ended his talk with one of his favourite verses which translates into \u201cThere are only two destinations for freedom-loving people (before George Bush made \u2018freedom-loving\u2019 a dirty word). Either the throne or the gallows.\u201d That\u2019s the spirit with which you have to have to approach entrepreneurship. No half measures will work.

Umar told his story and shared experiences that kept everyone engaged.\n\nHe spoke about how he got to Cambridge and then to MIT and why he decided to move back to Pakistan to work here. He thought he could make a difference. He believed that in some small way he could bring about change. Once that was clear in his mind, he just had to come back. And he certainly has brought about change in the lives of many young people who look up to him as a mentor, as a teacher, as a co-conspirator and as a guide. Four Lahore-based startups later he is still going strong and wants to help set up many more in the Saif Center for Innovation that he has set up in Lahore.\n\nUmar spoke about raising capital and how it is very important to recognize when to go for angel funding and when to look for VC funding. Many questions followed and he answered each of them as fully as possible\u00a0 but finally he handed over to his colleague Adil Saleem the CTO of SeenReport, a company that Umar Saif helped to incubate.\n\nAdil spoke about why he gave up a well-paid job to enter the crazy world of a startup and what that experience has been like so far. He also talked about when they knew that Seenreport would really take off \u2013 during the Lawyer\u2019s movement when people put so many photos and videos and reports of protests and the marches that were taking place. Perhaps the timing was just right and the SeenReport team has not looked back since. The content on their site has been picked up by foreign news sites and they have signed up a few corporate customers. They have also raised VC funding and there is no way to go but forward.

I wish the video had been longer and the interview more in-depth but hey it gives us a glimpse of how the man thinks and responds. One day we will have him here in Pakistan and I promise you he will be amazed at the talent that exists here.\n\nI loved the quick-fire round where Guy said he preferred Twitter to Facebook, Apple to Microsoft and Google to Yahoo. And my heart broke for the person who was crazy enough to give Guy an iPod as a gift with his pitch on it. Neither did Guy look at the pitch, nor did he use the iPod. He gave it to his son. As one of the guys said to him at the interview, Guy Kawasaki has made being a technology evangelist sexy.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Guy Kawasaki talks with entrepreneurs in\u00a0Bangalore"},

By now there were 330 delegates. The vacant chairs had been placed on one side of the room so that the late entrants would not disrupt the proceedings. That worked well too.\n\nJawwad and I met Arbab, a young software engineer from Pindi who had flown in for the event. He told us about an exciting product that he and his friends have developed. It is being fine-tuned right now but is ready to fly. Will do a review on it as soon as it is up and running he is ready to talk openly about the product in depth together with its features. Real innovative work. It had my adrenalin pumping I can tell you. :-)\n\nThe next speaker was Batool Hassan who is Business Development Manager at Acumen Fund. She talked about the kind of grassroot initiatives that are being funded by Acumen Fund and about the need for more entrepreneurs to look at the social sector as a business option. She explained that a social enterprise was not a charity. It had to be run on the same principles as any other businesss. It had to generate revenue to be self-sustaining and to be able to pump profits back into further ongoing activity. A great speaker who cleared the myth regarding social entrepreneurship by putting it in clear, concise and simple terms.\n\nThings heated up before lunch when the new generation of entrepreneurs who use social networks and new, emerging techniques for generating business and getting customer feedback took on the big boys from the world of multinationals. Adil Moosajee of Ego and Shahjehan Chaudhry of Home Express were on one side of the debate whereas representatives from Reckitt Benkiser and Unilever were on the other side. The topic that was under discussion was: Conventional wisdom is becoming increasingly irrelevant. In the new, networked, interruption economy, is it necessary to follow traditional wisdom to create something awesome, disruptive, and world changing?\n\nPersonally I thought Adil and Sha put on a very convincing case for the motion but after a very intense debate ably refereed (hehe) by Hasan Rizwan, the audience voted in favour of Conventional wisdom. I guess there is a lot of unconditioning to be done and a lot of young minds to corrupt before we can expect a different kind of result. We are up for it, aren\u2019t we Adil, Sha, Jawwad, Sabeen, anyone???\n\nThis was followed by lunch which in iteself was a delight. A menu chosen to suit many diverse requirements included various types of pastas, roast beef with an awesome gravy, roast chicken in mushroom sauce, a tikka type of concoction and, to be honest, I didn\u2019t get to the other stuff because already I had people commenting on the amount of food I had on my plate. Dessert included apple pie with a vanilla sauce and ice-cream crunch.\n\nThe networking that ensued over lunch was also part of the deal and you could see people trying to sell concepts, create linkages and overall get to know each other.\n\nTo ensure that too much food didn\u2019t put people to sleep, next came the Taal Karisma story followed by a musical performance. Talented young people creating music with a mix of instruments that is not conventional. Appreciation all round as some youngsters had actually had actually moved to the floor to be closer to the stage and the performance.\n\nDuring lunch the room had been arranged to accommodate a dozen breakout sessions which included:\n\nBootstrapping with Sabeen Mahmud, Director, PeaceNiche\n\n Branding with Adil Moosajee, Owner, Ego\n\n Raising Capital with Ali Ansari, CEO, Dewan Drilling\n\n Social Media with Rabia Garib, Editor, CIO Magazine\n\n Pitching with Jehan Ara, President, PASHA & co-conspirator Jawwad A. Farid, Author, Reboot\n\n Building Teams with Shireen Naqvi, Director, School of Leadership\n\n Social Entrepreneurship with Haamid Jaffer, Director, Murshid Hospital\n\n Technology with Ahmed Allauddin, CEO, Millenium Software\n\n Public Relations with Salaina Haroon, Marketing Director, CIO Pakistan\n\n Company Culture with Yusuf Jan, EVP, MIXIT Inc.\n\n Creating an A-List team, Humaira Ahmad, Senior Consultant, Engage HR\n\nAll the sessions were interesting and many people whinged about not being able to attend more than one. Nonetheless, it was fun. We enjoyed running our pitching session. Somewhere in between, Imtiaz Noor joined Jawwad and me and added value to the discussions. We are evil so after providing some guidelines and providing examples, we ran it on a workshop style and had some of the kids pitch to us. This way we were able to provide them with feedback on the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts and how to make their pitches more effective. I think the kids enjoyed it as much as we did. The young man who made the best pitch got a copy of Reboot. :-)\n\nLooking around one could see that there was immense activity in each part of the room as the facilitators interacted with their groups. I heard balloons being burst and a lot of applause and cheers from different corners of the hall. Suffice to say fun was had by all and a lot of learning took place.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Great things continued to happen at TiEcon\u00a02009"},

He was fun, he was honest and he shared the successes as well as the challenges. I doubt there was anyone in the room who didn\u2019t like the guy who said that one of the reasons he was able to put in 24 hour days was because he had a cooperative wife who in their 8 years of marriage had only spent two years with him. Before you let your imagination carry you away, his wife Munira is overseas studying medicine.\n\nThe next story was that of Student Biryani \u2013 a brand most Karachiites know. Saleem Shahzad, the youngest son of the founder of Student Biryani Haji Muhammad Ali, related the story of how his father migrated to Karachi from UP India in the thirties, how we worked in restaurants from the age of 12 \u2013 cleaning, washing, waiting on tables before he took the entrepreneurial route. From what started as a modest little restaurant, emerged a chain of restaurants across the country with several franchises, and a plan to now take it outside the border of Pakistan into the Middle East, the US and the UK.\n\nSameera Raja of Canvas Gallery was next. Her story was so inspiring. She had been widowed when still in her twenties, was a single mother, struggled with cancer and yet was able to start and grow a business due to her sheer determination and her ability to manage time and schedules. If you ask her today, she will tell you what exhibitions are scheduled for December 2010. The woman is truly amazing and it was a pleasure listening to how she got to where she is. Adversity hasn\u2019t managed to demotivate her or keep her from\u00a0 pursuing her dream and her passion. Hard work and an interest in art have been responsible for the success she has achieved.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, was our own Jawwad Ahmed Farid, author of Reboot and CEO of Alchemy Technologies. He looked slightly overdressed in his jeans and hawaiian shirt when compared with Adil\u2019s gear.\n\nJawwad\u2019s presentation was impressive and timed to the second. His story is interesting but his presentation style made it even more so. He had chosen some really great photographs and had obviously rehearsed many times to carry it off without a hitch. I was witness to one dry run the evening before when I dropped by his office on the way home.\n\nThe youngsters couldn\u2019t get enough of him. He was surrounded during the teabreak and I caught him ensconed with many a youngster at several times during the day. Isn\u2019t it wonderful when seasoned entrepreneurs make themselves available to young people so that they can pick their brains. Way to go Jawwad. I hope you\u2019ll always be this accessible.

Sabeen Mahmud, the President of the TiE Karachi Chapter, and I weren\u2019t really too hyped up about the event because there were too many other things that were preying on our minds \u2013 topmost being the fact that Zak is in hospital after a severe heart attack followed by a 4-hour bypass. When a friend who means so much is ill, everything else takes a back seat.\n\nHowever, it was a responsibility that we had taken on and there was no way that we were going to let down so many people who had worked hard to put the event together and the many more who had registered to be there. So we dragged ourselves to the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi yesterday. We were there at 8 a.m. although the event was not supposed to start until 9 a.m.\n\nThe Torque team were taking care of everything so there wasn\u2019t really much for us to do at that stage. As Sabeen said, things were probably under control and if they weren\u2019t, it was really too late to worry about it. So we went downstairs to the coffee shop to get our caffeine \u2018fix\u2019. We were soon joined by Adil Moosajee in his Mr. Happy t-shirt, shorts and flip flops. He was one of the speakers for the day. Adil is a nice sort and easy and fun to hang out with. So we chilled, talked about his presentation which he was only just putting together :).\n\nThe event started at 9.15 am. By this time there were already 200 attendees with more slowly trickling in. The stage was in the centre with several tiers of seats all around \u2013 a formula that had worked the previous year and so why knock it?\n\nThe proceedings started with Sabeen giving a little introduction about TiE and the program for the day.

Would things go according to plan? Would it all pan out? Would 8- 10 weeks of 20 hour work days and sleepless nights pay off? Would people show up at all? All these questions raced through my mind as I drove to the Sheraton at 6 a.m. on the morning of the 14th. I had a breakfast meeting with Zafar Khan, CEO of Sofizar, who had flown in from Lahore especially for the two events.\n\nThe P@SHA Tech Crunch Gong Awards event was to start at 10 am. Presenters, judges and participants started showing up early. Great sign. Showed the enthusiasm people felt. P@SHA was holding this event for the first time. The response to Call for Entries had been tremendous. And now here we were all there waiting for the pitches to begin.\n\nEighteen participants had been shortlisted. They were each to make 5 minute pitches\u00a0 followed by 5 minutes of Q&A.\n\nA panel of 8 judges would assess the pitches:\n\nZafar Khan of Sofizar\n\n Jawwad Ahmed Farid of Alchemy Technologies\n\n Adnan Haider Co-Founder of Lootmaar and currently working as a consultant for IBM\n\n Imtiaz Noor Mohammad, a Marketing guru and a blogger\n\n Azhar Rizvi of the Tech Angel Network\n\n Yusuf Jan of Mixit Technologies\n\n Faisal Khan of Ovex Technologies\n\n Fawzia Salahuddin of Alchemy Technologies.\n\nThe Gong lady was Rabia Garib, Editor-in-Chief of CIO Pakistan. She would make sure that people\u2019s nerves were shattered by the sound of the gong if they didn\u2019t conclude when they were supposed to. And so she did. My nerves were shattered the most as I stood in close proximity to her. Boy did she enjoy hitting that gong!\n\nAround 160 people showed up. We had thought there\u2019d be around 100. And they stayed through the session from 10:00 am until around 3 pm when we ended with lunch. Some brought their lunch plates to The Demo Pit area so that they could network with participants and look at demos of products in greater depth.\n\nWhy the hell did they all stay? Could it have been because Samir Feroze started his pitch by asking if any of them had wasted time and added calories by trying to locate the best lassi in town \u2013 ANY town \u2013 whether it was the town they lived in or one they were visiting? Because, he admitted, that he had added several inches to his own waistline by searching for the perfect lassi. All you had to do to ensure that others didn\u2019t suffer the same fate, was to yell out to YellO.pk.\n\nOr did they stay because Mehdi Hasnain eloquently talked about the need that MamooinPakistan fulfilled for those who are thousands of miles away from their homeland \u2013 things like arranging medical visits to hospitals and/or doctors for ailing parents, getting copies of birth certificates or university degrees, looking up land records, arranging for airline tickets, making funeral arrangements, etc etc.\n\nOr was it the service that Usman Siddiqui of The Readers Club pitched that caught the imagination of those who were present? Renting books online and having them delivered to your doorstep \u2013 thus making reading more affordable. Of course the example that Usman gave made one author and his agent cringe ;). The Readers Club had Jawwad Farid\u2019s book Reboot in its collection which means people didn\u2019t have to spend Rs. 990 to read it <sigh>.\n\nOr maybe it was Fariha Akhtar\u2019s pitch for a project that she has visualized which she calls vFight that will deal with reporting and fighting of harrassment against women. She received quite a few suggestions from judges on how to take this forward and where to get funding for the project.\n\nOr could it have been the Izhar brothers, Talha and Haris, with their passionate pitches for an SMS based photo service and a mood-based location based service? They presented with confidence and fielded the questions put to them by judges who were tough but fair.\n\nAnd these presentations were just the tip of the iceberg.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2009/09/26/today-i-have-renewed-faith-in-the-judiciary/", "text": "It was a special day. I got up with a feeling of great excitement. Something very significant was taking place and I had cleared up my morning schedule to be a part of this important moment. An old school friend, whom I have known for many years, was taking oath of office as a Judge of the Sindh High Court. Rukhsana Ahmed, after\u00a0 putting in 15 hard years as a lawyer in the High Court, was to become Justice Rukhsana Ahmed.\n\nOver the years we had seen her put in hours, days and months of blood, sweat and tears into her professional work. There was no case that was too small or too insignificant. It didn\u2019t matter whether it was a poor person for whom she was handling the case gratis or a corporation that was\u00a0 paying her to fight on their behalf, justice was what she strived for even if it meant burning the midnight oil. It wasn\u2019t always easy \u2013 in fact it was hardly ever easy \u2013 but she toiled, she gave it her 100%, and yesterday she was rewarded for the untiring years of effort that she has put into her profession.\n\nThere was no way that Afia and I, who are lucky enough to be counted amongst her oldest friends, were going to miss sharing this special moment in her life with her. We knew there would be limited seating and that we may not be allowed in to view the oath-taking but we were not giving up without even trying. And if they didn\u2019t allow us in, we were going to wait outside to be one of the first to congratulate her on her achievement and her appointment. So I left home at 7.30 am, picked up Afia at 8:15 am before joining Rukhsana and her family at their home. From there we drove in 3 cars to the High Court.\n\nOne could sense that Rukhsana was tense. It was a big day for her. She knew the seriousness and somber nature of the job that she was going to be taking on, the great responsibility that the office of Justice of the High Court brought with it. She hoped that she would measure up to the position (of which we had no doubt).\n\nIt was also an emotional day for her. This was something she had strived for all her life, s omething she had dreamt of since joining the legal profession, a day that would have meant a lot to her dear belated mother. How extremely proud she would have been. Aunty always had great faith in her daughter.\n\nWe reached the High Court on time and were heralded into the Judges Chambers \u2013 fortunately some seats had been arranged for the family (Afia and I consider ourselves as part of Rukhsana\u2019s extended family). I had taken my flip video and iPhone 3Gs with me so that I could take photographs and record the oath taking.\n\nProceedings started on time with the recitation from the Holy Quran. Then the Registrar, with the permission of the Chief Justice of the Sindh High Court, announced the name of the ten judges who were taking oath that day. This was followed by the Chief Justice of the High Court administering the oath. It was all very somber, very professionally conducted. They took an oath to protect the Constitution, to ensure that justice was carried out in all cases brought before them. The weight of each word must have weighed heavily on each judge as they uttered it. This was like no other job. It carried with it the power to mete out justice \u2013 to ensure that the guilty were punished and that the rights of the innocent were protected.\n\nAs we listened, we realized how far our friend had come, how much she had achieved and the position of responsibility she was taking on. My heart filled with pride and joy. I felt privileged to be a part of this special moment, to be able to share it with her and to show her that she had our love and our respect.\n\nRukhsana has always been a compassionate, fair and loving human being. Her only failing ever has been that she gives too much of herself to family, friends and even colleagues. You only have to pick up the phone and mention that you have a problem and she will drive miles at any time of the day or night to help you, to be there for you, to provide the support that you need. She is also a person of great integrity and has an immense sense of justice. It therefore renews my faith in the Pakistan Judiciary to know that a person of her calibre and her integrity has been appointed a Judge of the High Court based plainly on her capability and the years of work she has put in. I know that the Judiciary will be stronger with her being a part of it and that she will spare no effort in ensuring that justice is done.\n\nJustice Rukhsana Ahmed has been a friend for decades. She has always made us feel as if we were great achievers but as we stood there today watching her take oath of office, we realized how little we had achieved and how far she had come. Good luck my friend. You deserve the respect that this country has given you. We know you will do your best and although I am told that Judges don\u2019t have fan clubs, like it or not, you are stuck with a fan club of many admirers who share your happiness today and take pride in your achievements.\n\nJustice Rukhsana Ahmed being greeted by family and friends after taking oath:", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Today I have renewed faith in the\u00a0Judiciary"},

There was a competition going on. Callers were being asked very simple questions \u2013 if they answered 3 of the questions, they would qualify for a prize.\n\nSo one of the questions was: Complete the name of the following James Bond Movie: \u201cThe Man with the Golden ___________ (options were provided: Tooth, Gun or Eagle). It took a long while before one of the participants answered correctly.\n\nAnother question was: Complete the following sentence: \u201cAn apple a day keeps the _____ away\u201d. Would you believe that one of the callers asked for some hints in order to be able to answer the question correctly.\n\nSimilarly, the RJ asked one of the callers: How many books has Dan Brown written prior to the release of his new book \u201cThe Lost Symbol\u201d. The caller said he had watched one of the films but hadn\u2019t read any of the books.\n\nBy now I was pulling out my hair. How could these young people with American accents not know the answers to such simple questions? We have so many talented young people in this country. Many of the technologists that I meet are into reading \u2013 whether it be fiction, thrillers or science fiction or autobiographies. They are concerned about the society in which they live. They discuss issues and try and find solutions. So where have these airheads comes from? Are accents and fashionable clothes and carrying the latest mobile phone all that these kids are into? Is giggling and pretending to be dumb considered fashionable? Arggggggggh!\n\nFortunately a young woman came on who answered all the questions correctly and appeared surprised that anyone could have had trouble answering them. Good for you kid!\n\nOh and I forgot to mention the flaky RJ who was hosting a show later in the day. He related a story about a cyclist who travelled to 32 countries of the world with just US$2 in his pocket. He admitted that he didn\u2019t know the exchange rate, nonetheless he rounded the two dollars off to around Rs. 220. I guess he knows something we don\u2019t.

All the entries were so good \u2013 each had a different slant, a different dream, a yearning to make a difference. Each revealed a bit about the person behind the entry, the entrepreneur or the one aspiring to be one. I just couldn\u2019t pin it down to ten so I pleaded with Jawwad Ahmed Farid to sell me 4 more copies so that I could increase the number of winning entries to 14. :) And I asked him to personally autograph each copy \u2013 which he did! Thank you Jawwad.\n\nSo here are the winners:\n\nSome of the entries were truly inspiring. Although some of the information in the entries was confidential, I thought I would share snippets that weren\u2019t. Here are some of the reasons that winners gave for why they became entrepreneurs or why they want to become entrepreneurs:\n\n\u201cI was doing a lot of things I never believed in and working on solutions that didn\u2019t excite me\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no alternative to the freedom in doing something of your own rather than working for someone else. Unleashing the true potential, bringing out the creativity in you and breaking the monotonous cycle of a job in outsourcing based industry \u2026. \u201d\n\n\u201cMy reason for having an interest in reading \u201cReboot\u201d is the same as that of reading Founders at Work, Hackers & Painters, Blue Screen of Death, The Soul of a new Machine and many other books related to entrepreneurship or hands on experiences of startups: Primarily these books help you to keep motivated by telling you that you are not alone in bearing the hardships and the challenges. \u201d\n\n\u201cOne of my life goals has always been to radically change Pakistan. I fell in love with the possibilities of bringing real change to the healthcare sector in Pakistan and I am extremely lucky that this start up of mine fits in with my life goals\u2026 and will eventually be part of the change i want to see\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sitting in an entrepreneurship course, going through a case study, a session defining the word entrepreneur in its truest sense. Where people make such ventures which completely change the world. Follow that with a solo project that gets as high marks as a group of the top four students from the class. Follow that with an idea floated on a platform for a business plan competition which is preceded by foundations for the entrepreneurship society on the City campus resulting in a event conceptualized in ten days, and come out of bureaucratic red tape in a month, working like clockwork showcasing ten ventures in front of experienced entrepreneurs \u2026 Add in daily dose of Techcrunch showing immense number of startups getting funding in recession\u2026also add the knowledge of knowing that one of the top venture capitalist firms is being headed by a Pakistani\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI became an entrepreneur after seeing my dream job at IBM become my worst nightmare. I lost interest in working on the same piece of software day and night with so much red-tape \u2026 My aim is to create value in Pakistan\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing convinced that I should start doing something at age of 16, I started by preparing a list of projects from the vast spectrum of life with the help of my grandfather. After a week a list was prepared and I began exploring and narrowing down the list\u2026Top of my list was growing Tomatoes in P.E bags. Although I had lived all my life in Karachi and had no family background of agriculture, Melons was the second crop that I grew or at least tried to grow in my backyard. All this was after dropping out of Operation Badr. Then I joined hands with my brother, collected our pocket money and started a web hosting company by buying a reseller account. It was at this stage that I learned that the most difficult part in not the programming its the sales\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I decided to become an entrepreneur, I didn\u2019t even know I was becoming one. We were a bunch of friends in the second year of undergrad who got together to \u201cdo something\u201d. There were various reasons why I chose to be a party to such a crime. One, I\u2019ve always been at the leading end of the pack \u2014 somehow always managed to step ahead and take charge of study projects, sports teams, etc. Two, I\u2019m driven by passion. The upside of this is that I\u2019m really dedicated when it comes to something I really want to get/earn/make. The downside is that if I\u2019m not passionate about it, chances are I might never care. Couple that with boring courses, torturous lectures and annoying assignments and you have an explanation for my average undergrad GPA!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to waste myself in some big organization doing boring stuff. I had some innovative ideas and I wanted to evaluate them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe all that it takes to be a good entrepreneur is to have some really creative, out-of-the-box ideas and a fair judgement. And I believe I possess them both. What\u2019s more, to work for someone is the worst thing for me \u2013 not that I can actually abide by the rules and regulations, but that\u2019s like a severe inhibition to your own creative skills.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo answer the first part of your question in one word: Freedom! Yes it\u2019s all about freedom. Freedom to decide my destiny. Freedom to create a system, a corporation, which does not only produce wealth but also create significant values in our lives.\u201d\n\nAnd finally one that is especially relevant to the title of the book:\n\n\u201cI faced the blue screen of death\u2026 and\u2026 and I rebooted! So far my system is trying to log into the windows again but has not succeeded yet.\n\n Yea, I am a kid \u2026 but the leader inside me knew that my system will crash again and again before booting into a stable operating system, so I started a little earlier. I powered on my system when I joined the university, after continuous attempts at booting..I finally succeeded.. I logged into windows\u2026!!! But I knew.. it was nothing to get mad at. My windows was not stable, it could face the blue screen of death any time and that\u2019s what happened.\n\nWhen I was about to graduate, the joy of graduating brought the grief of blue screen. Obviously, I tried the three finger salute, but it couldn\u2019t do anything. Eventually, I shut down instead of rebooting. Why? because I had to plan and think before starting again. After planning and thinking for a year, I have now powered on my system once again. It has not yet succeded to reach the login window. It is still booting. I am trying hard and putting my effort to complete this boot in a way that it does not crash again.. but obviously, it can happen\u2026 I\u2019m trying to log in before I get out of the school but if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll reboot once again. One thing is sure. I\u2019ll keep on rebooting\u2026\u201d\n\nI have brought the copies for the Lahore winners with me to Lahore today. If you are coming to the P@SHA Iftaari, you can collect them. Otherwise, pick them up from the distributor Imran Zia :). He can be contacted at imran(at)vahzay(dot)com. :)\n\nCongratulations guys.

Ammar is also known as Chai Walah (a name given to him by the infamous Rabia Garib) because of the venture he co-founded with Asim Imtiaz (now working at Amazon.com in Scotland) called Teabreak.pk.\n\nTeabreak started off as a blog aggregator and has managed to aggregate as many as 1350 Pakistani blogs. The purpose, says Ammar Yasir in this interview on ITLoW, was not to highlight known bloggers as much as it was to highlight great blogs that were relatively unknown.\n\nAmmar also talks about the role of social networking in our society and how much it has empowered the individual. There are challenges no doubt as people learn to use social networks. With freedom to communicate as easily and with increased reach, also come responsibilities.\n\nTeaBreak.pk has grown and developed over the past year and a half and has been not only promoting and bringing together bloggers from across Pakistan, but have also been talking about ethical blogging, using blogs to promote the image of Pakistan, and with Teabreak 3.0 there are going to be new areas of emphasis. Ammar tells us about future plans in his conversation with me on ITLoW.\n\nAmmar also talks about the need for more local language blogs and the importance of photo blogs \u2013 perhaps even expand the reach by attracting more people into putting up podcasts and videocasts. He thinks there is a need to get more university students involved in blogging and professors putting up lectures online.\n\nIt is amazing how much time Ammar, Asim and others in their team commit to Teabreak.pk considering that they have high pressure, full time jobs.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2009/09/13/the-new-itwaar-bazaar-sunday-market/", "text": "Itwaar Bazaar has always been what people in the West would refer to as a flea market. It was always an innumerable number of stalls under tents on a large dusty ground in Karachi. Every Sunday a lot of people converged on the one in DHA to browse, buy books, clothes, fruit, vegetables, trinkets, household goods \u2013 in fact almost anything and everything. Many of the regulars referred to it as a treasure hunt. Visitors from out of town were taken on visits to Itwaar Bazaar because it was a unique experience and although sometimes the heat and the dust got to you, for many Karachiites it became a haunt at weekends \u2013 a place where they would loiter and shop and often run into friends and associates. My friend Afia always said it was the best way for her to unwind.\n\nDoes this look like what I have just described? If it isn\u2019t, the reason is that they have upgraded Itwaar Bazaar. They have cemented the walkways, put up some fancy overhead covers to protect you from sun and rain. These are mostly made of windsheeter material with a few being of fiber-glass. I think the intent also is to put up directional signs so people will know where to go for particular items of food, clothing or household goods \u2013 in other words, a large outdoor supermarket.\n\nThey call this progress. But is it? A first view of the makeover made us comment \u201cBut they\u2019ve taken the soul out of the place. It is now akin to any other cemented shopping experience.\u201d It has lost its intrinsic charm and the sense of mystery that it has always had. What will they do next? Aircondition the place?\n\nMaybe we are over-reacting. Maybe the old place was too dusty, too informal, too disorganized, too difficult to navigate in. But that was part of the fun, wasn\u2019t it? It was a treasure hunt \u2013 the intent was not so much to shop but to loiter, to discover, to hang out, to just while away some time \u2013 and of course end up buying this and that. It was the informality of the place that gave it heart. This place looks like a touristy flea market. It has lost its essence, the original flavour, and the intricate natural connectedness it had.\n\nWill we stop going there? No. Will we get used to the new swanky Itwaar Bazaar? Sure we will. Will we start to find reasons to say that in some ways this new Itwaar Bazaar model has its distinct advantages? Of course we will. One that we came up with on our visit was that because of the paved walkways, people in wheelchairs, and those with prams, would now be able to come here too. Had they wanted to achieve this purpose, they could have tried either thicker carpets, paving stones or cobblestones rather than cement. But \u2018they paved paradise, and put up a parking lot\u2019\n\nWe will begin to accept these \u201cimprovements\u201d and will perhaps over time forget the orignal Itwaar Bazaar but for the moment, I miss the old place. It has for me lost its comfy, homely feel. Does everything need be organized? Can\u2019t some things be allowed to just naturally evolve and co-exist in the cemented surroundings which have become a part of our \u201ccivilized\u201d environment?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The new Itwaar Bazaar (Sunday\u00a0Market)"},

So when he finally agreed to come in and talk about Entrepreneurship, and his book \u201cReboot!\u201d, we were both delighted.\n\nI asked him how he wanted to be introduced since we weren\u2019t really interviewing him as CEO of Alchemy Technologies. It was Jawwad the author that we would be talking to, and asking about the book and its reincarnation. He said \u201cIntroduce me as Jawwad Ahmed Farid \u2013 a failure and proud of it!\u201d and so I did.\n\nJawwad is a friend and someone I have respected and admired for several years. His ability to handle failure and success and come through it all unscathed and without losing his sense of humour, his faith in people, and his humanity has always amazed me.\n\nIn this episode of ITLoW, Jawwad tells us his story. One of the first set of BCS graduates from FAST, Jawwad worked in the local software industry for 5 years before he decided he had had enough. His father, unlike most fathers, had advised him right at the outset, to start his own venture. He had told Jawwad that he deserved better, that he should go after his dream, write his own future. Amazing man.\n\nSonny boy didn\u2019t listen at that stage of course but after five years he realized that Abba had been right all along. So he went away to Columbia Business School to learn how to start and run his own business.\n\nReboot! is about his journey as an entrepreneur. His business plan. How he raised money. How he ran a couple of companies into the ground, lost everything he had and more. Acknowledging your mistakes, and talking about your failures, can\u2019t be easy but Jawwad Farid does it with a touch of humour. He seems to be saying \u201cIt is alright to fail \u2026 there is no need to hang your head in shame as long as you get up and try again.\u201d People in the Northern Hemisphere fail all the time, they learn from their failures and move on. It is only in South Asia that failure is a stigma. Why so? Doesn\u2019t a child fall off a horse when he/she is first learning how to ride? Don\u2019t we pick him/her up, say it\u2019s okay and ask him/her to get back on and try again?\u00a0 So why can\u2019t the same be applied to people who fail in business ventures \u2013 as long as they run their businesses ethically?\n\nJawwad says the best time to try out your ideas is when you are fresh out of university and have no obligations or commitments to meet. The opportunity cost at that stage, he says, is very minimal compared to 5 or 10 or 15 years down the road when you are walking away from a six-seven digit salary and a pension and perks. So why did he wait 5 years, and go to business school, before he started his first venture? I asked him that question and many more in this episode of ITLoW. Tune in and find out what he had to say. I really enjoyed the interview because it was a conversation with a friend. I hope you enjoy it too.\n\nBy the way, I have my 10 copies of Reboot! The deadline to qualify for a free copy of this soon-to-be bestseller is September 10. Send in your entries if you haven\u2019t done so already. It is an opportunity not to be missed.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Jawwad Farid, the author, caught on\u00a0tape!"},

One of these is SeenReport which won the E-Community and E-Inclusion Award at the P@SHA ICT Awards 2008 and was nominated for participation at the Asia Pacific ICT Awards in Jakarta.\n\nSharjeel Ahmed Qureshi, who is the young CEO heading See nReport, sent me the following Press Release\u00a0 earlier today. The whole team comprising Sharjeel, Adil and Yaser amongst others have worked hard to get to this stage. I interviewed them on ITLoW earlier this month to talk about what it took to start up the venture and get to where they are. Closing Series A Round investment from a foreign VC is no small achievement. Well done guys and good luck for the future.\n\nSeenReport Private Ltd has closed Series A round of funding from Al-Janabi Group, a leading media investor in Middle East. SeenReport is the largest citizen news portal in Pakistan and provides both users and media organization expertise in combining traditional and new media by leveraging its rich social media suite.\n\nSeenReport CEO, Sharjeel Ahmed, says, \u201cWe are really excited to acquire investment from Al-Janabi Group. As a prominent media venture capital firm, they bring a lot of experience and guidance to the table. Combined with the passion and expertise of SeenReport\u2019s team in fusing traditional and new media, we will certainly achieve higher grounds.\u201d\n\nWhen talking about the way forward for the company, Sharjeel said, \u201cSeenReport is making a strong impact on the way news is created, shaped, distributed and perceived by the people. Traditional media has already started to embrace SeenReport\u2019s platform. We feel that the funding is well-timed and will enable us to grow our company. We will use this funding to expand the company, strengthen the platform and explore the international market.\u201d\n\nSince its launch on 10 June 2008, SeenReport has made huge strides and now offers a full blown news sourcing and publishing platform. The platform is specifically geared towards gathering news via cell phones, micro-blogging and live casting. The platform supports rich multimedia content and taps into the prominent and emerging social networks and blogs in order to create a comprehensive social media suite.\n\nSeenReport has made its mark with news sourcing platform and unique business model to provide its off-the-shelf social media suite to news organizations and media companies. Already engaging thousands of people and establishing a client base, the social media suite is capable of powering any international news organization\u2019s citizen journalism arm.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "SeenReport successfully closes Series-A Round\u00a0investment"},

Each year we get together to celebrate the magic of technological innovation in Pakistan. And each year we are both surprised and delighted by the number of quality entries that we receive. The Awards are now in their sixth year.\n\nLast year 3 of our P@SHA ICT Award winners \u2013 PixSense, TPS Pakistan & Kraysis \u2013 went on to win the APICTA Awards. Yes that\u2019s right. Out of 145 products that were showcased at APICTA from the Asia Pacific region, 3 out of the 16 winners were from Pakistan. It was a truly glorious moment for us as an industry.\n\nSome of the participants made connections during the Awards that led to business being contracted and that showed the value of participation \u2013 and not just winning.\n\nWe are trying to share some of the experiences of those who took part \u2013 in our book they are all winners. Listen to what Adnan Agboatwalla of PixSense,\u00a0Jawwad Farid of Alchemy Technologies, Shehzad Shahid of TPS Pakistan, Saad Hussain of Five Rivers Technologies and many others that we will keep adding to the P@SHA Awards website.

There are also a few service categories that companies can nominate themselves for \u2013 these include Best in Operational Excellence, Best in Service Innovation, Best in System Integration and Best in Brand Development. Deadline for entries is September 24, 2009.\n\nThis year we have also added a couple of categories for customers \u2013 CIOs in the Public and Private sector who have worked with companies to implement solutions and change the way they work internally and with customers.\n\nResearch & Development and the Tertiary Student Award categories are open to Universities as well. Let us have more entries from across the country so that we can have an exciting final. Let us not let it be a clean sweep.\n\nThese awards could never go ahead if we didn\u2019t have our invaluable sponsors who provide the funds to enable us to do this. This year we already have the early sponsors \u2013 the Gold Sponsorship has been taken up by Microsoft Pakistan, the Silver Sponsorship has been taken up by the National ICT R&D Fund and the Bronze Sponsorship has been taken by Intel Pakistan. We are all grateful to them for their support. We are hoping other friends and partners to come on board in the coming week and we will keep adding them onto the website as and when the commitments are received.\n\nOur friends Rabia Garib & Salaina Haroon at CIO Pakistan are working closely with us on this year\u2019s Awards event so you can expect a lot of buzz and activity all the way through to the Awards event on October 14, 2009.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The P@SHA ICT Awards are here again.

So I decided that since Dr. Qasim Sheikh was in karachi, we would call him into the Studio and have a chat with him, to try and get him to demystify the Fund.\n\nThis interview with Dr. Qasim Sheikh is an hour long so we have decided to break it up into 2 segments. In this episode Dr Qasim talks about how the Fund was set up, the process, the kind of activities and projects it has funded, what kind of proposals they have received, some of the problems that have kept these proposals from being looked at seriously, etc etc.\n\nDo watch the episode. It clears up a lot of misconceptions. If you have questions for Dr. Qasim, you can post them here or on the CIO Webstudio. Dr. Qasim has promised to answer any questions that we have for him.

He also talks about what people are using the Internet for and where there are still some stumbling blocks and things to be a little weary of.\n\nThe problem with not having a set of pre-planned questions and letting the conversation flow is that sometimes your guest turns the tables on you and starts interviewing you instead. And this is what sort of happened in this episode. Badar surprised me by asking what I thought had happened over the past 3 years in terms of Internet usage and particularly in people using Google apps and the Google Search engine. I don\u2019t like these kind of surprises I must admit. However, as usual, I said what I thought. And what was that?

In its reincarnated published form, the book is called \u201cReboot!\u201d\n\nJawwad presented me with one of the first copies of the book which has been printed in Singapore and is going to be available for sale at some local outlets in the next couple of weeks (it is seen here sharing space with my MacBook Air).\n\nI have already placed an order for 10 more copies of the book. Why do I need so many copies you might ask?\n\nWell, I am going to present copies of Reboot to ten young entrepreneurs. You could be one of them. What do you have to do to qualify for a copy of this book? Send me an email at jehan(dot)ara(at)gmail(dot)com telling me why you decided to become an entrepreneur and why do you think someone should fund your idea.\u00a0 The 10 best emails will be sent a copy of the book, and a few of the aspiring/startup entrepreneurs might qualify for an interview on ITLoW if their answers to my follow-up question (which is a secret for now) are interesting enough. Don\u2019t forget to include your mailing address and your phone number. Deadline for entries: September 10, 2009.\n\nNow let me tell you a little bit about why the book is an invaluable addition to your essential library.\n\nStarting with a list of questions Jawwad weaves in Reboot a tale that takes readers in search of the deepest fear of a new entrepreneur \u2013 What if I fail?\n\nA touching confession that alternates between the bittersweet reality of a dying venture and the promise of multi million dollar valuations, Reboot is a journey of self discovery that every entrepreneur can relate to. It is a book of questions and answers that will force us to re-examine our personal prejuidices against failure.\n\nIn terms of the author\u2019s personal profile, Jawwad Ahmed Farid has been teaching entrepreneurship at SP Jain\u2019s Dubai campus since May 2007. Prior to this he taught the subject at SZABIST in Karachi and ran entrepreneurship workshops for P@SHA in Karachi and Lahore as well as participated as a founding member of the Startup Insiders initiative with P@SHA. He has also been a local mentor in the MITEF Business Acceleration plan and is part of P@SHA\u2019s mentoring network. Reboot is currently used as teaching material at LUMS, FAST ICS \u2013 Lahore and at SP Jain Dubai. There have been about 2000 downloads since it was launched as an e-book.\n\nIn the author\u2019s own words, \u201cI have run three businesses into the ground in Pakistan and the US as well as run small companies through two major recessions and my approach to teaching the subject is very localized. There are some cultural and social taboos attached with failure in the regional culture and I start with addressing that upfront. Then focus on bootstrapping techniques that get a business to a first customer and revenues within the first six months with as little funding as possible.\u201d\n\nJawwad\u2019s formal experience is as an entrepreneur or in roles supporting entrepreneurs in small businesses since late 1996. Formal education includes an MBA from Columbia University and a first degree in computer science from FAST ICS, Karachi.

Each event had its own excitement and value but one of these stood out in terms of where the Pakistan IT industry is at, and how far we have come.\n\nGreen Computing is a word being bandied about a lot in the West thee days. It is the \u2018in\u2019 thing. Everyone is talking about it and wanting to find ways to implement it. In countries like Pakistan, where energy problems have been a major issue, it is even more important that we look for ways to conserve power and to use it as efficiently as possible.\n\nSo when a Lahore based company forms a joint venture with the leader in Virtualization in the US, to open up operations in the Middle East, it is reason enough to celebrate and to feel a great sense of pride.\n\nI am talking, of course, about the formation of Clear Cube Middle East \u2013 a joint venture between Clear Cube Technology and Five Rivers Technologies, Lahore.\n\nFiveRivers Technologies (FRT) is a success story par excellence. They were able to forge a strong partnership with ClearCube Technology through providing high end software development services at a very competitive fee when they started in 2003 with 4 people working on stand alone modules. Six years later, they are now at a stage where all software for ClearCube Technology (CCT) is being developed at FRT. This also includes software for VDIWorks, a software outfit that CCT has spun off. This relationship climaxed with the release of Sentral 5.0 in May 2006. Sentral was later awarded the gold medal at VMWorld 2007 as the best desktop virtualization application.\n\nWorking on state-of-the-art technologies at the cutting edge of competition against some of the best known names in the industry, this work has been done by Pakistani software engineers, who if given half a chance, are next to none in talent and ability. Five Rivers has proven that to be true.\n\nClearCube Technology, the leader in centralized and virtual computing, held a seminar on Green Computing on August 19 in Karachi to announce the new joint venture. The new company, ClearCube Middle East, will enhance ClearCube\u2019s global footprint and deliver a full range of products, services and support to customers in the Middle East and South Asia regions.\n\nCCT say that they have experienced strong demand for centralized and virtual computing solutions from the Middle East region which is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen reported by analyst firms like Gartner in their emerging market analysis for 2009. They are therefore expanding their footprint in this region.\n\n\u201cMy team and I are very pleased to be delivering ClearCube\u2019s world-class hardware, software and services to the region,\u201d said Syed Saad Hussain, Director for Business Development with ClearCube Middle East. \u201cThe demand for secure computing and low cost virtual computing is growing rapidly across numerous vertical segments including government, education, energy and commercial verticals. ClearCube has an excellent reputation globally and is well position to experience continued strong growth.\u201d\n\nThe ClearCube Middle East office will serve Kuwait, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and India. More information can be found online, at http://www.clearcubeme.com.\n\nAfter the welcome address, Salman Ansari, CEO of SATC, presented the keynote on Green Computing and its potential in Pakistan, Hasan Rizvi, CEO ClearCube ME followed the keynote by apprising the audience with an overview of ClearCube in Pakistan. This was followed by a presentation by Zafar Ul Islam, Technology Specialist, Microsoft Pakistan who spoke about Getting Virtual & Getting Green the Microsoft way and before we broke into a very interactive Q&A session, Khawaja Tanveer, CIO Unilever Pakistan gave his expert view on Going Green: the FMCG Perspective.\n\nConsidering that Information and Communication Technology accounts for 2 percent of global CO2 emissions, according to Gartner \u2013 the equivalent of the airline industry, it is about time we seriously thought about doing something to change the scenario.

It was a huge card which said \u201cTuesday 03 March\u201d on one side and on the other side there was a cute anime character which was meant to be Umair I assume, and the contact information.\n\nOn enquiring I was told that the name of the company was \u201cTuesday\u201d and 03 March was the incorporation date. Why did they name the company \u201cTuesday\u201d. For the answer, you will have to watch this episode of ITLoW.\n\nWhat does this company do? Well it is difficult to describe. They are a combination of many things \u2013 Creativity, Strategy, Technology, Interactivity, Online Services, etc. Their website has some of this information. The team is interesting to say the least.\n\nI had three of them in the studio \u2013 Irfan Kheiri \u2013 Chief Technologist & R&D Lead, Zakaullah Khan \u2013 Content Head & Scriptwriter and Umair Mohsin \u2013 Business Development Head/Strategist. Their designations tell you nothing because they have multi-faceted talents and hence most of them poke their noses into every activity that the company is involved in. Being a small team, multi-tasking is a must in any case. They are a real bunch of characters and I had a lot of fun talking with them.\n\nUmair and Zaka are both IBA graduates whereas Irfan is actually a Computer Science graduate from FAST. He teaches animation and special effects at SZABIST. Listening to their stories highlighted some of the issues that young people face during their early years. Irfan, for instance, was always interested in drawing but he did not realize that he could have studied graphics and animation and pursued a career.\n\nAnimation & Gaming is still not considered a good career option for several reasons. The HEC needs to recognize that this is a great field of study and that a University needs to be set up to focus on the development of talent for the Animation and Games Industry. Once that happens the industry around it in Pakistan which is limited, will grow because there is a lot of business globally that they can target. Of course the promotion of this segment of the industry will also become imperative.\n\nSome of the marketing ideas that \u201cTuesday\u201d is starting to implement are exciting and will be able to attract eyeballs that traditional forms of media are not able to deliver on. But if the company is going to scale they will need to change the mindset of marketeers who are used to doing things in a certain way. They will also need to be able to scale up \u2013 that is when they will face problems in finding the right kind of people to join their team.\n\nAs a country we have a lot of creative talent that is not being tapped, that is not being nurtured and trained. These people will add value not only to the gaming and animation industry but to the media and entertainment industry, to the advertising industry and to many other sectors. Should we really continue to neglect such an important sector?\n\nWatching this episode of ITLoW will possibly open up the minds of some to the possibilities and opportunities that are out there. Some things have started\u00a0 happening already because people like Zaka, Irfan, Umair and their Chief Strategist Salman Abedin have decided to ignore the challenges and march ahead. However, if we want to see much more happening in this space, we need to do something about it \u2013 and we need to do it now.\n\nAlthough Salman Abedin, the Chief Strategist of Tuesday,\u00a0 was unable to make it to the show, I managed to capture his talk on Connecting Brand with Online Content.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Watch the team from\u201dTuesday\u201d on\u00a0ITLoW"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2009/08/17/joining-the-e-rally/", "text": "I have always referred to myself as a citizen of the world. My friends used to make fun of me when i was much younger. They\u2019d ask \u201cWhat does that mean exactly?\u201d I would try and explain but they never really took me seriously.\n\nWhen this year I joined the Independence Day celebrations on 14th August, some people wanted to know what had happened to the \u201ccitizen of the world\u201d label. So I started to think about it. Why was I celebrating? The foremost reason was that, having grown up in Hong Kong, I believe in celebrating everything. There is too much sadness in the world anyway so whenever there is an opportunity to let my hair down, I grab it with both hands.\n\nIt all started really when Farhan Masood, an entrepreneur/blogger/tweeperson (well i can\u2019t really call him tweeple in singular, can I?) sent me a message asking me to replace my Display picture on twitter with a Pakistani flag. I wrote back that it always confused me when during any kind of e-rally, everyone used the same picture because I really had to focus in on the DP to know who I was talking with. The next thing I knew, Farhan had taken my display picture and placed it on a green flag graphic. Actually it looked quite cool and I didn\u2019t have any reason to be confused any more.\n\nThe objective was to celebrate the good and beautiful that was taking place within Pakistan. Many of us \u2013 especially those who are young \u2013 feel the need to hold onto something that will keep them motivated and excited about the next day, and the next and the next. We have gone through a lot of bad days lately but there have been good things that have happened in this country, there have been people who have shown us the beauty and talent and brilliance that exists. So to focus for a day on the positive things around us without forgetting the things we need to actively work to change, seemed to me a good idea. And, anyway, I owe a great deal to this country (and to Hong Kong). It has provided me with opportunities to do what I am good at, to create value, to make friends and long term relationships and to be the best I can be. This country have indeed given me a lot.\n\nThe e-rally brought people together \u2013 not AGAINST anyone but to support each other and to create a feel-good environment that would recharge us for the real issues that we need to tackle. Talented people, whom some of us had not heard of, were highlighted, as were beautiful places in the country, achievements of many individuals \u2013 athletes, human rights activists, technologists, artists, health practitioners, business people, philanthropists, musicians, etc.\n\nYusuf Jan, co-founder of Mixit Inc, even decided to write a song entitled \u201cGreen&White\u201d which was very popular on all the FM channels and on some online fora. In a blog post on Desihits.com, the writer refers to the song in these words:\n\nPie in the Sky made cookies that resembled flags and were distributed by several IT companies to their teams (quite yummy actually), there was dancing in the streets, people counted their blessings and made resolutions on how they were going to make this country, and the world, a better place to live in. Pakistan became and stayed a trending topic on Twitter throughout the 24 hour period after which some Pakistani tweeple joined the Indian Independence Day Celebrations on twitter and started to put up hashtags like #IndiaPak peace. The e-rally was covered by Dawn News and other mainstream media.\n\nWhat upset me was the way some youngsters celebrated \u2013 with stunts on motorbikes which put their lives and that of others in danger. The aerial firing is of course the worst form of celebration. I have never understood why loud violent noises need to be a part of revelry.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Joining the e-rally!"},

I have broken it up into 3 different videos because it seemed sensible to do so.\n\nParts of the session were very basic \u2013 and something many of us already know \u2013 but the interactive session brought out some of the issues that are being faced by entrepreneurs, and possible ways to handle them.

His children are taken care of and happy. His living space is clean and comfortable. I even had another child because he wanted one more. I work so that he can continue to send money home to his parents in the village. What more does he want from me? Why does he still doubt me? Why is he still annoyed with me?\u201d wailed my young housekeeper on my return from KL.\n\nOn further inquiry I learnt that apparently her husband had started passing snide remarks about knowing what she was up to all day in the house while he was at work. He said he could see how happy she was while he was away. He apparently resents the fact that she indulges in idle chit-chat with the chauffeur (who takes care of my father during the day). It is interesting to note that the driver is a friend of her husband\u2019s. They are on family terms and have known each other for years.\n\nShe tried to explain to him that she has to go inside the house to give my father his meals, to do the cleaning and ironing, and the driver is there because my father now needs help with everything. What is she supposed to do? Not talk to him? When people work together, she said, they talk and sometimes they laugh. Is there something wrong with that? It is all quite innocent.\n\nShe was very upset that he had insinuated that she was flirting with the driver. She said \u201cHow can he even think that? He knows what kind of a woman I am. Why are my morals suspect all of a sudden?\u201d He said she could go home to her mother if she wished.\n\nPeace-loving as I am, I lost my cool completely. First of all, I have known this young woman for 7 years. She is a happy-go-lucky person who loves her husband and children and who has shown a lot of compassion to my father during his illness. She has never given her husband any reason to doubt her moral character. How dare he insult her like this? And did he think that if he sent her away, he would continue to avail the accommodation that we had provided them?\n\nI was really upset. I could see what his annoyance had done to her. For several days she didn\u2019t smile. Her eyes looked sad. He had robbed her of her dignity and her confidence in their marriage. She felt he had taken something very important away from her. I wanted to talk to him and yet I didn\u2019t want to make things worse for her. This was between them and although I could offer her support, I did not want to interfere in her marriage.\n\nBut this did make me think about how \u201cviolence\u201d can be more than just physical, how one person can cause such mental anguish in another. I remember another case where a man kept telling his newly married wife (who was a bright and confident young woman) how stupid she was, how incapable she was of doing the simplest things \u2013 to the extent that she began to rely on him for everything and became totally dysfunctional without him. She lost all confidence in her abilities and when he eventually left her, she was a shadow of a person who could neither function professionally, nor socially. Physical violence is something we recognize and talk about a great deal but what about this invisible thrashing that totally kills a person from the inside? Isn\u2019t that an even worse kind of violence?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Shouldn\u2019t this be considered violence\u00a0too?"},

I had never met Corazon Aquino\u00a0 but I did remember when Cory was suddenly pushed into public life after the assassination of her\u00a0 husband Benigno Aquino. Everyone referred to her as a reluctant leader which she was, but she brought with her a breath of fresh air to Philippine politics. She was honest, humble and felt a moral responsibility to rid the country of a dictator who had been at the helm of affairs for 20 years.\n\nEven as a young person living in Hong Kong at the time, I was drawn to what became the \u201cPeople Power\u201d movement in the Philippines. The yellow signature dress, the yellow t-shirts, flags and caps, the yellow ribbons everywhere. Cory had inspired and won the hearts of the people of her country and they came out in droves to support this woman who wanted to bring about change. In 1986 she fulfilled her husband\u2019s dream of ridding the country of Ferdinand Marcos through a democratic movement that the world watched with admiration.\n\nAs we observed a few moments of silence at the MDG3 Asia Regional Workshop in KL to show our respect, the Philipino delegates could not hold back their emotions and broke into tears. She stood for something special \u2013 a moral leader who was loved. In her election campaign she had said \u201cI agree with my critics that I do not have the years of experience that Marcos does \u2013 the years of\u00a0 practising corruption, dishonesty and misuse of power \u2026 \u201d but she promised to serve to the best of her ability.\n\nIt is no wonder then that the people of the Philippines came out in the hundreds of thousands to bid farewell to a rare breed of politician \u2013 a moral one who discharged her responsibilities ethically. In the eulogy at her mother\u2019s funeral, Cory\u2019s daughter Kim said that the Philipino people honoured her family by coming out into the streets and expressing their grief at her mother\u2019s death. She said that although she had lost both her parents, her family believed that any sacrifice they made the people of the Philippines were worth it.\n\nRest in peace Cory!

The brainstorming, the coding, the planning, the nights you stay awake figuring things out over pizza or tikka and coke is all very exhilirating. But this is fun and games compared to the real tough parts.\n\nWhen you have a partner(s), no matter how much you may trust each other, you need to think through your professional business relationship. You need to decide at the outset the ownership structure, the roles and responsibilities, what happens if someone wants to leave the startup at any given point in time \u2013 in fact all the possible scenarios should be discussed out in the open so that there are no misunderstandings. People grow, their visions and interests may change, they may have reasons for treading a different path. It is important to plan that ahead of time so that the company doesn\u2019t suffer when faced with such issues \u2013 and neither do any of the founders or partners.\n\nDr. Umar Saif shares his experience in setting up the 4 startups and he suggests that open conversation, sharing reservations and honesty and trust be a part of any new setup. He has only formalized the structures once investment came in because it is an expensive thing to do and also because investors want certain conditions met so restructuring may be required anyway.\n\nWe also discussed Jawwad Farid\u2019s book \u201cThe Bluescreen of Death\u201d which Umar used for teaching and he said it proved to be much more useful than Harvard case studies because the kids related to the content in the book, to Jawwad\u2019s predicaments, the way it affected relationships, etc. The book has so far been available as a free download but has been updated and will be launched as \u201cReboot\u201d. I will run some sort of exercise and give away some copies of the book. So watch this space for an announcement regarding that.\n\nFinally I got Dr. Umar Saif to talk a little more about the Saif Center for Innovation and what his plans are regarding that initiative.

I couldn\u2019t miss the opportunity of dragging him onto the set of ITLoW and just chatting with him.\n\nSince ITLoW has already interviewed him about his startups, he asked quizically what we would talk about. I was very vague because, to be honest, I didn\u2019t know what I would ask him. But I needn\u2019t have worried.:)\n\nWe just had to sit down and get started, and before we knew it, the interview had gone on for an hour. Umar and I talked about how we could motivate more young people into heading down the entrepreneurial route, why it was important that they experiment and try something of their own earlier rather than later. We also talked about the hard work that goes into becoming a successful entrepreneur, that not everyone has what it takes to be one.\n\nBut, as Umar says, if you do have that bug, and you do become an entrepreneur, you have the opportunity to make a much greater impact on society and you certainly have more of an opportunity to create wealth and make a difference. If you do the math, if you think about how much more interesting an entrepreneurial existence can be compared to most jobs out there, then maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 you might decide to take that first step toward starting your own business.\n\nUmar and I also talked about the lack of trust deficit, the inability of most companies to form partnerships and create bigger markets for themselves, the synergies that exist that are not being capitalized upon.\n\nDr. Umar Saif is frustrated that more kids are not going into research. It is certainly needed but unfortunately it is not considered glamorous enough. There is just so much awareness that needs to be created, so much counseling that has to be done. However, we are taking strides \u2013 one step at a time, sometimes more.\n\nThis is part of of a two part series. Do go eavesdrop on my conversation with Umar Saif and let us know what you think.

Generally more than 200 papers are accepted for the conference out of 500+ submissions. But Hummies submission criteria is so tough that generally 9-10 papers become eligible for the competiton. This year 9 entries were submitted and out of these 7 were shortlisted for final presentations on July 10, 2009\u00a0 in Montreal Canada. nexGIN had both of its entries shortlisted.\n\nThe Judging Committee consisted of Wolfgang Banzhaf, John Koza, Darrell Whitley, Riccardo Poli, and Erik Goodman. According to Dr. Muddassar, these are the most respected names not only in evolutionary computing but also in Computer Science.\n\nThe results were announced today and I am delighted to inform everyone that the nexGIN entry based on the papers A Hybrid GA-PSO Fuzzy System for User Identification on Smart Phones and Keystroke-based User Identification on Smart Phones have won the silver medal.\n\nThe silver medal is worth $3000. According to Dr. Muddassar, nexGIN missed the gold medal, which is worth $5000, by a very small margin. He said that all credit should go to Shahzad and Saira who did this remarkable work. The gold medal was won by\u00a0 Steffany Forrest \u2013 the most distinguised researcher in CS \u2013 whose paper \u201cA sense of Self in Unix Processes\u201d has more than 1000 citations and is among the top 3% cited papers overall in CS. She gave an excellent presentation.\n\nThis is for the first time in the history of the conference that a team from Asia has been among the top 3. Dr. Mudassar Farooq hopes that these efforts will bear fruit and help to change the image of Pakistan.\n\nCongratulations to Saira, Shahzad, Dr. Muddassar Farooq and the entire nexGIN team for this amazing achievement in computer science research.

I must admit I was quite curious about this chap because several people had asked if I had ever met Murad \u2013 some of them are people I greatly respect.\n\nFirst impressions and instinct are very important to me. As Mannan Amin, CMO of Tintash, who was holding onto dozens of glasses of Slush that he had brought for everyone to counter the heat that day, introduced me to Murad , I looked up at him, saw him smile, and knew right away that he was someone I would like talking to and hanging out with. And I was right. Of course the fact that he had worked for five years at my favourite company Apple Computer Inc. had nothing to do with it. ;)\n\nAs we traveled up in the elevator hoping that the electricity would not be turned off by PEPCO/WAPDA, the Tintash co-founders chatted and joked with each other and with me \u2013 it was as if we had known each other for a long time. I learnt a little about their background and must admit I was impressed.\n\nMurad Akhter has over seven years experience in product management and software development in Silicon Valley\u2019s high-tech industry. Prior to Tintash, he worked at Apple Computer on flagship products such as the company\u2019s first line of 64-bit systems as well as its transition from PowerPC chips to Intel\u2019s multi-core processors. He later worked on jukebox and VOIP applications for the Ultra-Mobile PC platform at Microsoft before starting Tintash in 2007. Murad graduated from Stanford University with an MS and BS in Computer Science. He had gone to school in Lahore at Aitchison.\n\nMannan Amin has a Masters in Management Science with a specialization in Innovations, Viral Marketing, and Entrepreneurship from Stanford. He feels very proud and fortunate to be amongst the very few who have been part of key courses at the newly founded d.school, school of cross disciplinary innovation, at Stanford. As part of these courses Mannan got a chance to do projects for the top management at Facebook, Firefox, GlobalGiving, JetBlue and Fidelity Investments. Earlier Mannan was at LUMS where he did his BSc CS and a year of LUMS MBA. Mannan is incredibly passionate about cultivating an environment for entrepreneurship in Pakistan. He remains ever the optimist!\n\nBoth these gentlemen teach \u2013 Murad at LUMS and Mannan at FC College. Those kids are lucky to have in their adjunct faculty such passionate entrepreneurs and technologists.\n\nI can safely say that my interview with these two guys was very different from any interview I have done to date. First Mannan snatched my flip video and decided that he didn\u2019t want a conservative formal interview. How could it possibly have been a normal or formal interview with such a duo as interviewees? He proceeded to chalk out an agenda on the glass coffee table which was a pretty good idea and then finally we proceeded with the introductions.\n\nWe discussed how these two got together, their strengths, the work that this young company has done in its two years of existence, the challenges that they face as a startup games company. We also talked about how they are dealing with these challenges, what they feel can be done at an industry level and what are the kind of areas in which the government can assist.\n\nThey also shared their excitement at having Tintash\u2019s latest application for the Apple iPhone amongst the top ten on the App Store. This was not their first iPhone App and I could see that they are already working on the next one. I met the team of young people who work in the Tintash studios and was very impressed at the passion, the commitment and the sense of ownership that they showed.\n\nMurad and Mannan are very gung-ho about Pakistan and the talent that exists here. They think that we have only scratched the surface in terms on innovation and that there is so much that can come out of Pakistan. I wonder if that\u2019s why, despite their crazy schedule, they find the time to teach, to mentor and to be a part of industry activities. I am sure it is.\n\nIt was a pleasure meeting with them and hearing their story. It showed me once again that my faith in our industry is not misplaced and that there is indeed much more to look forward to in the years ahead. Do go and watch the interview with the Tintash team and come back and tell us what you thought.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Murad and Mannan from Tintash on\u00a0ITLoW"},

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2009/07/06/umar-saif-gives-us-an-insight-into-his-activities-on-itlow/", "text": "Dr. Umar Saif is someone that many of us have been impressed with for quite a while. He is the epitomy of the kind of people we need in our universities. He is a mentor to the young people who are entrusted in his care. He is a teacher, a researcher, a counselor and a friend \u2013 someone the kids can look up to, someone with achievements who is there to help them become achievers, who is there to hold their hands when they need it, to pat them on the back when they have done well, to motivate them and brainstorm with them when they are stuck, to work with them to find solutions, to provide a nurturing environment for the talent that is in abundance in this country. For those who don\u2019t know him, Dr. Umar Saif is an Associate Professor Computer Science Department at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. But he is so much more than that. He is also a Researcher and a serial entrepreneur.\n\nA graduate of the University of Cambridge, Umar spent almost four years as part of the Oxygen core team at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). At MIT Umar also helped start and manage the multi-million dollar Cambridge-MIT Institute (CMI) collaboration on Pervasive Computing. He is still a part of the O2S group at CSAIL.\n\nAt LUMS he is also leading the Dritte initiative and was recently involved in running the University of Washington, Microsoft Research (Redmond) and LUMS collaborative distance learning course on \u201cComputing for the Developing-world\u201d. Some of the initiatives under Dritte include:\n\nDr. Umar Saif is the Founder of 3 startups at LUMS- BumpIn.com, ChOpaal.pk and SeeNreport.com. These are the first 3 citizens of his dream incubator that he has finally been able to set up in Lahore \u2013 S.C.I. (Saif Center of Innovation).\n\nAnother venture that Umar and his team have started is called findalong.com. Umar refers to it as Google Docs or Google Search on Steroids. It allows users to search collaboratively online, to store stacks of research collaboratively so that each person doesn\u2019t have to replicate what someone else has already researched on the same subjet. Perhaps I am not really doing a good job of explaining the strengths of Findalong.com but why should I even try when there is a video that does it so well.\n\nSome of his work that has been recognized by various entities and groups includes:\n\nUmar Saif says that whatever he has achieved to-date has been possible because he has been fortunate enough to find and work with a brilliant group of people who are excited by what they do. He said this interview was not about him but about the bright minds that work with him, the ones who have burnt their boats and are creating businesses that will eventually be multi-million dollar successful businesses.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet Dr. Umar Saif and some of the young people who are part and parcel of the startups that he has founded \u2013 Sharjeel Ahmed Qureshi, CEO of SeenReport, Adil Saleem, Yasir Awan and Asim Fayyaz who is CEO of Chopaal.\n\nIt was one of the most delightful interviews I have conducted to date. In fact it was truly inspiring.\n\nHere was a young man who had been an undergrad student himself just over 10 years ago. He had consciously made a decision to return to Pakistan because he\u00a0 believed that they would have a better life here, that he would be able to contribute to the development of this country as well as do the kind of work that he loved.\n\nAnd there were these young people who had sensed that this man was someone they should latch onto because he would bring out the best in them and, together with the passion for technology that they all shared, they would innovate and build sustainable businesses.\n\nSharjeel Ahmed Qureshi who is the CEO of SeenReport told me that he didn\u2019t realize all the other work that was involved in running a business \u2013 like opening a bank account, making a business plan, worrying about operational costs and procedures.\n\nUp until recently all three startups were bootstrapped with money coming from wherever it needed to \u2013 mostly Umar Saif\u2019s salary from LUMS. This last mongh Sharjeel had thought he would have to sell the tyres of his car to meet expenses but they were fortunate.\n\nUmar Saif and his team have found a Venture Capitalist or has the VC found them? So now all three businesses have their initial round of funding. The VC is apparently a blessing in disguise because he is very hands-on and is working with them to help open markets and by providing financial planning expertise.\n\nAnyway, I am not going to give the whole show away. This episode starts off with Umar Saif giving us an overview and then we meet and talk with Sharjeel, Adil, Yasir and Asim. Enjoy the show! I certainly enjoyed putting it together.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Umar Saif gives us an insight into his activities on\u00a0ITLoW"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/womens-leadership-conference-brings-together-150-businesswomen/", "text": "On June 25 as I walked into the conference room of the Avari Hotel in Lahore and found myself in a room predominantly full of women, I realized that this was a very different experience from what I was normally\u00a0 used to. I am more at home hob-nobbing with men than with women. I didn\u2019t quite know how I should behave or what I should say.\n\nHaving been a part of the IT industry for the last 16 years, where most CEOs are men, I have begun to understand how men operate professionally, how they react, how they network. But women are a totally different animal! :)\n\nAs I looked around slightly unnerved, I noticed that Shahida Saleem was just as much a fish out of water in these surroundings as I was, and so we quickly exchanged notes on how to increase our comfort level and learn from some of the most amazing women business leaders in Pakistan.\n\nThe event I am referring to is the Women\u2019s Leadership Conference that was organized by the Center for International\u00a0 Private Enterprise (CIPE). Why had CIPE organized this conference? Their rationale was simple. In a country of over 170 million people with over 50% being women, only 3% are said to be involved in economic activity according to the Federal Bureau of Statistics. In addition, the Global gender gap report marked Pakistan 128th out of 10 countries followed only by Saudi Arabia, Chad and Yemen.\n\nI am a little shaken by these statistics I must admit. There must be something wrong somewhere. I see a lot more working women today than there were five or ten years ago and the numbers are growing. In the IT industry alone the percentage has grown from 3% to 13%. Granted the glass ceiling has kept many of them from senior level management positions but even that is changing. Perhaps it is just not being documented to the extent that it should.\n\nAnyhow, so CIPE decided to assist and has been very much involved in helping set up Women\u2019s wings and resource centers in various Chambers of Commerce across the country resulting in bringing about 600 women entrepreneurs into the network of business associations. They have also helped in setting up women\u2019s chambers in the Punjab. The purpose simply is for these business assoications to act as change agents and draw more women into economic activity. A noble mission indeed.\n\nMr. Moin Fudda, Country Director of CIPE, started off the proceedings by introducing CIPE, the concept of the Conference and by introducing some of the participants including yours truly. :)\n\nMaha Rahman of Nur Concepts followed with a presentation about the women of Pakistan. This included women like Fatima Jinnah, Rana Liaquat Ali Khan, Benazir Bhutto,\u00a0 etc. She quoted Quaid-e-Azam M.A.\u00a0 Jinnah who said: \u201cNo nation can rise to the height of glory unless your women are by your side.\u201d According to Maha, there are at present 20% women in the workforce.\n\nThe Chief Guest was Seema Aziz who is the Chairperson of CARE and Bareeze. She is a modest and graceful wom an who has achieved a great deal through hard work and because of her passion to excel. She told us that Bareeze started with the concept of creating a quality product in Pakistan. People said it couldn\u2019t be done & even if it was, who would buy it? Such skeptics I tell you! Well, they sure were proven wrong. They now have 75 stores in Pakistan and operate in 5 countries including the Middle East and the UK. The quality of their material was so good that people questioned its authenticity \u2013 some asked if it was Pakistani, why was it so expensive; others said that it probably wasn\u2019t Pakistani at all \u2013 that they were probably importing foreign fabric and selling it as Pakistani. Talk about conspiracy theories.\n\nSeema said their commitment had always been to quality, to the customer and to being a \u201cMade in Pakistan\u2019 product although the manufacturing could have been done in China at a much lower cost. Bareeze has won the Best Quality Fabric outlet Award in the UAE and are proud of what they produce and the positive image they project of Pakistan.\n\nAs she wound up her talk, Seema Aziz was asked by CIPE to launch the CIPE Business Guide for Women \u2013 How to Start a Business. I have a copy and I think it would be equally useful for our young entrepreneurs \u2013 men or women. It was distributed to all the women who were present. If any of you would like a copy, send me your email address and I will email it to you. I am sure CIPE won\u2019t mind. Their purpose is to assist entrepreneurs.\n\nThe next speaker was Dr. Muhammad Azam Roomi who is a senior lecturer on entrepreneurship and is on a wide lecture circuit across the world.\n\nHis presentation was quite extensive but some quotes that he mentioned stuck with me \u2013 things like:\n\nI wonder if our leaders are aware of all this. Perhaps a lecture could be arranged for all parliamentarians :).\n\nDr. Roomi also said that Social sciences research proves that women have more self-awareness and social skills and men can never have the kind of e mpathy that women have. Therefore women are likely to be better leaders, he said.\n\nMs. Despina Pascal, an International Consultant and trainer, then talked about the role of Business Associations in leadership development. She gave examples of the kind of things that had been achieved in other countries due to initiatives that were started by Business Associations.\n\nHer talk was very comprehensive and it is impossible to replicate it all here. I am hoping that CIPE will put up the videos so that many more people can hear Despina\u2019s talk as well as that of Dr. Roomi who interspersed his comments with poetic recitations as well as excerpts from the Quran.\n\nEric Hontz, one of the few men at the event, talked about some of the major initiatives that CIPE has been involved in internationally an d their impact on the business sector. Some of the case studies in themselves provided food for thought.\n\nThen followed the most interesting part of the event \u2013 the Q&A session. This gave a lot of the women present there an opportunity to comment, to share and put questions to the panelists.\n\nI was amazed to see that the room was full of high calibre women, many of them at the top of their professions. How had CIPE been able to get them all together in one room. There were women from all over the country \u2013 Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta, Mardan, Multan, Faisalabad, etc.\n\nThere were also women like Daniya who is working on the USAID Empower Pakistan program. She spoke about the Gender Program and how women could benefit from it. There would be a focus on Jobs and on Performance. The program is also expected to help women in the area of Product Development. She also said that economic development and expansion is about value addition, it is about innovation, it is about product development.\n\nShamim Akhtar of the Lahore Chamber was in her element and absolutely delighted at the turnout. She made an offer to non members of the Chamber to come and use the Women\u2019s Resource Center and to benefit from the advice and the facilities provided there.\n\nHers was not the only offer. Several women \u2013 bankers, consultants, trainers all offered their services to the women who were present at the conference \u2013 some of these were voluntary services. CIPE will circulate the offers to all participants. There was a fitness consultant who provided some useful advice to women who have multiple roles in society. They were told they had to take care of their bodies and that breakfast was fuel for the day and should not be skipped under any circumstances.\n\nThe MC for the entire conference was Sheherbano Burki, Lead Consultant at Nur Concepts, and I must say she did a terrific job. She was clear, concise, witty and in control but yet did not offend anyone \u2013 a very difficult task to achieve.\n\nShe intercepted with relevant comments and introduced as many of the diverse people in the audience as she could and yet the conference was concluded within the set timeframe. Sheherbano and her team should be congratulated for a job well done. I would like to use them for some of the things that we do in Lahore. Wonder how expensive they are ;). I guess one has to pay for quality services and should not grudgingly do so.\n\nBefore I forget, I must mention here that Badar Khushnood, Country Consultant for Google, was also at the event. Google was mentioned by several of the speakers, as being a useful tool. Of course he wasn\u2019t allowed to sit quietly and was asked to share some stories of how technology empowered women to work remotely and thereby be a part of the economy. He quoted examples from Pakistan of young men and women who were earning considerable sums of money by harnessing the power of technology\n\nThe unique thing about this conference was that the participants constituted only professional women. They were there because they wanted to network, to create linkages. One person rightly said \u201cWe are each others markets. Why not start here?\u201d There were many inspiring stories of women who were leading organizations in the automobile space, in shipbreaking, in banking and financial services, in the health sector, in education, in technology, in training and development, in jewellery, in fashion and textiles and in businesses like Bareeze. It felt good to be a part of such a dynamic group and to listen to some of those women talk about what they had achieved and how much further they had to go. This was not just another event to show the \u201csoft image\u201d of Pakistan. It was a high powered gathering of women who were there with a purpose and I feel honoured to have been a part of it. I microblogged the event and was happy that there was a lot of interest in the proceedings from bloggers and tweeples alike. I missed our live blogger Fariha Akhtar.

Of course the fact that his company is literally a money-making machine that generates revenue for him while he is asleep, makes him an interesting person to talk to;).\n\nZafar is the CEO of Sofizar. He is a highly accomplished engineer from Caltech with several electronic advertising related patents under his belt and is very passionate about\n\n performance marketing.\n\nAs you will hear for yourself in this interview, Zafar worked at various organizations such as Nexiant and Gemstar in the US, Hong Kong and China before he moved to\u00a0 Pakistan and set up his own firm in 2004. He has made several mistakes and willingly talks about them so that others can learn from his experience.\n\nSofizar is a Carlsbad, CA based internet marketing company with development and operations based out of Lahore. The company has been aggressively pursuing a very rapid growth path since its inception in April, 2004. With annual sales of around US$20 million, they continue to look at a 800% growth rate. Sofizar\u2019s excellence was recently recognized by its recent signing of a deal with one of the largest telecom companies, Korea Telecom. Korea Telecom has been selected by Sofizar to market Sofizar\u2019s technology in Korea.\n\nThis is a photo of Zafar in Karachi at the MITEF Business Acceleration Plan competition which Sofizar won in 2007 (he is the one in the green checkered shirt). You may recognize some of the other people in the picture including Ken Morse, Hussain Dawood, Farroukh Captain, Junaid Iqbal, Jawwad Farid and Imran Zia. Some of us actually came to know Sofizar and Zafar better only after his participation in the MITEF BAP activity.\n\nHis excitement about what he does is truly contagious and many have commented about the fact that his eyes light up when he talks about making money :). He thinks businesses need to create wealth and employment in addition to creating value. Innovation in technology is one way to do it. He also believes in making a difference to the community in which you live. That is why he is usually a part of all activities which involve sharing of knowledge and experience. He is currently also a member of the P@SHA Central Executive Committee.\n\nAs a consequence of the MITEF BAP competition, Zafar went to MIT and hobnobbed with a lot of VCs and technology entrepreneurs. It is also where he met Carlos Cashman who has now become his partner. He says he feels honoured that three members of the MIT Sloan School faculty are now on his board of advisors \u2013 Ken Morse, Imran Sayeed and Bill Aulet.\n\nIn addition to interviewing Zafar, I spent some time talking with the Sofizarians \u2013 a team of really bright kids who realize that they are part of an exciting young company headed by an individual who is bound to scale the heights.\n\nSofizar is looking to revolutionize e-commerce, and is hiring \u201cthe best\u201d to meet its growth and profit objectives. These include engineers, SEO specialists, analysts and content writers. It is one of those companies that is growing despite the recession and is certainly one we should watch over the next 12 months.\n\nI didn\u2019t have to ask Zafar Khan too many questions in this episode of ITLoW. He usuallydoes not talk too much about himself but once I got him started, he was thrilled to share his experience and the latest about where the company is headed.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Zafar Khan, CEO of Sofizar, tells his story on\u00a0ITLoW"},

When I heard that Jahanzeb who is the Founder and CEO of Jugaari Inc,\u00a0 was in town, there was no way I was going to let him escape without getting him to the set of ITLoW. He had very little time but he was sweet enough to agree \u2013 and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nJahanzeb went to school in Karachi at Karachi Grammar School and then went onto LUMS for his BSc in Computer Science. Once he had done that, he played around with technology for a year while still at home (details regarding the tinkering are revealed in\u00a0 his conversation with us on ITLoW). In 2003, Jahanzeb applied to, and got into, Carnegie Mellon for his PhD in Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Speech Recognition. He has just completed his Phd so you can all call him Dr. Jahanzeb Sherwani. :) He is still grappling with the reality of that title.\n\nThis interview was one of the easiest that i have done to date. Jahanzeb is so excited by all that he has done, and is involved in, that i didn\u2019t have to nudge and\u00a0 poke to get him to talk about it. I just sat back and listened and enjoyed every bit of the story he had to tell.\n\nSome of the important things that came out in the interview included the need for cross-disciplinary interaction at University (yes I know we have discussed this before \u2013 just shows you that it is so relevant that it keeps coming back). There need to be projects that CS students, Business students and Social Science students work on together \u2013 each will bring their own strength and ideas to the table thereby resulting in solutions that benefit the community and business. At the moment young people don\u2019t work in the area of ICT4D because they believe that it cannot generate revenue for them. Nothing is further from the truth. ICT4D initiatives have to generate revenue to be self-sustaining.\n\nJahanzeb also told us that students at Carnegie Mellon have the option of which professors to work with on their PhD projects. Professors present their projects and students choose the one that excites them. Of course I am sure there is more to the process but the fact that it is the student who chooses which professor he/she wants to be attached to, is in itself amazing..\n\nIn this episode of ITLoW Jahanzeb emphasizes that any idea you have, should be tried out, especially when you are still at university \u2013 you never know which one will take off and become a huge success. You should not be afraid of failure \u2013 especially not at this stage. Jaadu VNC started life as a weekend project because J liked to\u00a0 play around with technology. It has ended up as a good business which he will take forward in a more structured fashion now that he has finished his doctrate. Click here to go to\u00a0 the original post and the first video that Jahanzeb uploaded to YouTube which, to his surprise, was picked up by Engadget and Gizmodo and got a 100,000 hits. At that stage the product was called Touchpad Pro.\n\nOver the time I have known him, I have found that Jahanzeb has been more excited about the HealthLine PhD project that he has been working on with Hands, an NGO. Speech recognition is, he believes, the equalizer, the ultimate enabler. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are illiterate or if you speak a different language. Anyway, I am not planning to give the whole show away. Go and watch the episode and listen to what Jahanzeb has to say about all of this \u2013 and more. And don\u2019t forget to check out the demo that he exclusively made for ITLoW viewers.\n\nThe iPhone application that he developed made it to the #19 spot on the iTunes App Store and was amongst the Staff Favourites.\n\nHe has an open offer for the brightest and most talented people out there:\n\nBy the way, Jahanzeb is not simply a computer scientist, an entrepreneur and a social scientist, he has other talents too.

He hardly ever smiles\u201d. But over time, I have got to know him better and although he is serious about a lot of things (which is a good thing), I have discovered that he also has a great sense of humour as you will see in this episode of \u201cIn the Line of Wire\u201d.\n\nAfter getting his Intermediate degree in Pre-engineering from Adamjee Science College , Farzal opted for a dual Bachelors in Computer Science and Economics\u00a0 from UT Austin (not something we hear much of in this country although it really makes such great sense). He then went on to do his MS in Information Systems from NYU while he was working with Merrill Lynch.\n\nTo truly understand what goes on in the mind of this young man, one only has to read what he says on\u00a0 his LinkedIn profile:\n\nHe says he is passionate about delivery channels \u2013 from Branchless Banking and 24\u00d77 direct insurance to mobile multimedia and social networking.\n\nThis can be seen from the kind of companies he has chosen to work with in Pakistan;\n\n1. amaana: amaana is the payment platform for emerging markets that bridges the gap between the banked and the unbanked population and helps to digitize transactions being conducted at the bottom of the Pyramid.\n\n 2. PixSense: A pioneer in mobile media solutions.\n\n 3. Trakker Direct Insurance: Employee 001, at the first direct insurance company in Pakistan, along the lines of Geico in US and Direct Line in UK.\n\nFarzal is also Visiting faculty at the Institute of Business Administration in karachi and is teaching IT/MIS/CS related subjects to BBA/MBA students. One of the things that Farzal does very effectively is use the internet to connect with his students. He posts course work, assignmnts, notices, information regarding guest lectures and exam notices and reviews online and maintains an open communication channel with the young people he teaches. I wish more teachers would use the power of the web so effectively. It doesn\u2019t take very much technical expertise to set it up and maintain it.\n\nIn this episode of ITLoW, Farzal talks about a host of topics including education, internships, the lack of sufficient innovation in the business sector and the tendency of IT companies to develop technology solutions for the sake of technology and not really as an answer to innovating the way business is done.\n\nWe also talk about how mobile solutions can help connect the rural parts of Pakistan to services and benefits that are not available to them at the present time. As you will see throughout the interview, Farzal is a bright young Pakistani who is intent on being a part of the solution to whatever ails this country. We have many such young people here, and with their participation in the overall development of business and of the society, there is every reason to hope that we will continue to progress.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Farzal Dojki \u2013 a technologist with a speciality in\u00a0economics"},

Armed with a BA from Brown University, he unwillingly joined the family business \u201cTanveer Textiles\u201d because, as the eldest son, that is what he was expected to do. But textiles was not his calling. He was bored but didn\u2019t quite know how to squirm out of the situation without upsetting his dad. There seemed to be only one solution \u2013 to join an MBA program. No parent would say no to education. So off went Nadeem to Harvard Business School.\n\nHis intention was never to come back. But little did he know that his destiny was to head the largest BPO operation in Pakistan. After having worked for Lycos and FTA Direct, he was drawn into TRG by Zia Chishti, the founder. The plans were actually drawn out on the Back of a Napkin at a coffee shop in Singapore and voila Nadeem joined TRG. Since then he has been in and out of Pakistan and, at present, he is MD and Country Head of the Pakistan operation.\n\nNadeem strongly believes that the BPO sector can grow tremendously in Pakistan, that we have so far only scratched the surface. We have the talent pool, we are heading towards better and better infrastructure, the professionalism has developed over the past few years. All that is needed is a bit of focus both from the government and the private sector and a large number of employment opportunities can be created and a lot more revenue generated for the country.\n\nIn his conversation with me on ITLoW, Nadeem talks about the early days of TRG, about how it came to be listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange, their acquisition strategy, bringing back work to Pakistan and now extending their expertise to the domestic market.\n\nTRG is no longer just a BPO operation. They also have a large division called TRG Tech. Their capacity building programs are innovative and the career growth is clearly mapped out so that young people know what to look forward to when they join the organisation. They also have a very successful work-from-home program which helps to draw in young men and women who prefer to spend limited time in the office.\n\nOne of the newest TRG initiatives is their MBA Recruitment program which is meant to groom fresh graduates by providing opportunities for them in TRG offices around the world. Once they have that experience in hand, they are either brought back to Pakistan or slotted into positions in international offices.\n\nIn this episode of ITLoW, Nadeem also talks about what the government needs to do and how we can work together to increase the size of\u00a0 the BPO pie.

It gave us a chance to have a conversation. We discussed a whole range of topics, went down memory lane for a bit, had coffee and ended up with a Bounty (the chocolate that is) or two.\n\nOne of things that many of you may not know about Sabeen is that if her O Levels Computer Science\u00a0 teacher had had any influence on her, Sabeen would not be doing what she has been doing for the last 16 years. The computer science teacher had told her that technology was not the right field of study for her, that she was not good at it and would never amount to anything. Well, the lady couldn\u2019t have been more off the mark!\n\nFrom the age of 16, Sabeen has been using technology for Desktop Publishing, Marketing, Multimedia Development, Interactive training, Content development and much much more. And what\u2019s more, she is extremely good at it. What do you have to say for yourself now Madam CS teacher?\n\nIn this episode of \u201cIn the Line of Wire\u201d Sabeen talks about \u201cfalling in love with the Mac\u201d, about how she ran Mac Hardware and Software Sales, Maintenance and Support at \u201cSolutions\u00a0 Unlimited\u201d, her experience as a New Media Architect at Enabling Technologies, setting up BITS with Zak, and finally visualizing and creating T2F \u2013 a space for culture, discourse and creativity.\n\nMuch of what Sabeen has achieved has been due to her passion and her need to get it right. The fact that she started working while still at college, had a lot to do with her career choices once she left college. By this time she had a clear idea which path to tread. This is something that is absolutely essential if youngsters are to avoid selecting careers which bore them to tears, or which they are not cut out for. Hence career guidance, and relevant internship and apprenticeship programs are an absolute must.\n\nCross disciplinary interaction between design, technology and business students cannot be emphasized enough if we are to produce graduates who are well-rounded human beings and not just coders, designers, project managers or business development executives.\n\nIn my conversation with Sabeen, she also talks about how she has used technology effectively to create and promote the T2F brand without spending a cent (or should that be paisa). With the popularity of social networks like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, etc. there are even more things to consider when you are designing and developing your campaigns. T2F only used online media to market and promote itself \u2013 and they have been very effective. Sabeen shares some of the simple things that she did to make it happen in this episode of ITLoW.

In a message on the OPEN website, Dilawar Syed, the President of OPEN Silicon Valley, and someone many of us met at the launch of CIO Pakistan in Karachi last year, says:\n\nThis year the Keynote Speaker is Tom Campbell who is a noted educator (former Dean of the Haas School of Business at Berkley),\u00a0economist and an experienced public servant presently on the council of economic advisors to Governor Schwarzenegger).\n\nThe other distinguished keynote speaker is Masood Jabbar, a 16-year veteran of Sun Microsystems who led global sales for Sun, and\u00a0served as President of Sun Microsystems Computer Division. In addition OPEN Forum 2009, is also going to host a compelling line-up of more than 55 speakers.\n\nI remember going to an OPEN event in Silicon Valley a couple of years ago and must admit to being impressed at the calibre of speakers and the quality of the audience. The networking alone is worth it. I met a lot of Pakistani Americans who were there to learn from each other, to mentor, to talk about issues and opportunities and to generally create an impact.\n\nSeveral IT professionals from the Pakistan IT industry are regular attendees at this event \u2013 Adnan Lawai of Folio 3 and Faraz Hoodbhoy of PixSense (Faraz of course lives in the US, whenever he is not on a plane) and Monis Rahman of Naseeb Networks to name just a few.

This year a little bird tells me that Syed Azhar Rizvi, CEO of the Technology Angel Network and Vice Chair of MIT Enterprise Forum Pakistan, will also be attending the event and meeting with the Charter Members of OPEN before flitting across several cities in the US to meet with other OPEN Chapters. We hope that Azhar and all those who are flying from Pakistan to the OPEN Forum, will have a productive event.\n\nThe Conference Agenda seems quite comprehensive and interesting. I wish Mountain View wasn\u2019t so far away. I would have definitely attended the event.\n\nThere is an element to this event that I think is particularly useful \u2013 it is termed Entrepreneurship Idol. This is where entrepreneurs will get to present a three minute pitch to a\u00a0panel of judges who will provide quick, honest,\u00a0and insightful feedback.\n\nFor more information regarding the event, do visit the OPEN Silicon Valley website.\n\nThis year CIO Pakistan is a media partner of the event. Rabia Garib has been interviewing some of the speakers and making the videos available on the CIO Webstudio. I am sure she will be making much more rich content available to us from the OPEN Forum 2009 leading up to, and during the event. Good luck friends at OPEN.

Saqib Mansoor, Senior Manager of HR at TPS, had made an appointment to meet up with me at my office at 9:30 a.m. He wanted to discuss some capacity building issues that the industry faces and to make effective suggestions to counter them. He was also bringing over a cheque for the P@SHA Swat Relief Fund from the TPS team. So of course I said yes.\n\nI was running late that morning but I got there 15 minutes before he was supposed to arrive, only to find that there was no electricity. The generators in our building run the lights, fans, airconditioners and all the computer equipment but NOT the elevator. At any other time I would have walked up the 5 flights of stairs grumbling and panting all the way (I am totally out of shape). But I have hurt my knee and my orthopaedist has warned me to avoid going up and down the stairs for the next few weeks if I want the knee to heal. So I phoned Saqib. He was unperturbed \u2013 said it was okay and that if I didn\u2019t mind, we could just meet in his car or mine. We would have the airconditioning on and it should be no hassle. I said okay I was game. Then I went and settled down in my car, listened to music on FM, while I waited for him.\n\nIt was good to see that the young man arrived on time. Having been brought up in Hong Kong, I have always been a stickler for punctuality. He joined\u00a0 me in the car and we started our conversation. Twenty five minutes later Maria, who is the Marketing Manager at P@SHA, messaged me on my mobile to let me know that the elevator was working again so Saqib and I moved upstairs for the rest of our discussions.\n\nIt was an interesting discussion and we are going to follow it up with some decisive action mid-week. But what has stuck in my mind is the unusual meeting venue and our unwillingness to give up on the meeting despite the hurdles.

He is still working on that but in the meantime he has launched what is an online library \u2013 \u201cThe Readers Club\u201d.\n\nBefore he launched the site, he sent me a link to ask what I thought about it. I was happy to see that someone his age was concerned about the dearth of libraries in this country and the cost of books in general which made reading an expensive proposition. Of course there are bookshops selling old books but those don\u2019t always have a varied collection.\n\nThe Readers Club remedies the high cost of purchasing books with a Book Rental Service that allows unlimited rentals on a monthly subscription plan. Purchasing even one new release a month can cost more than most of the rental plans they have on offer.\n\nThough, The Readers Club plan-sizes are based on how many books a subscriber may hold at any given time, ALL of the plans offer unlimited books each month. You can read as many books as time allows, during any given month. The idea was for it to function like a Netflix style service for books.\n\nWhen I asked Usman if he thought this was a sustainable business model, he responded that the idea\u00a0 was born simply out of his love for books and did not start of, like most businesses, with just pure commercial interest in mind. Of course he wants it to be profitable and self sustaining so that he can keep expanding. But the foremost goal is to get people in the habit of reading by giving them easy and cheap access to quality and relevant books. He says they don\u2019t want to make a quick buck.\n\nUsman himself is an avid reader, he says and so are some of his closest friends. Reading and discussing books\u00a0 on varied topics is passion for them. They have often been frustrated by the lack of access to good public libraries and no big collection to choose from. He says they are fortunate to be able to just walk into Liberty or Paramount or OUP and pick up any book they like. But unfortunately not everyone can buy books costing hundreds or thousands of rupees. The purpose of The Readers Club is to remedy that situation.\n\nUsman also emphasises that that they are paying very close attention to the collection they make available. They are not just offering old second hand books that you can buy at any used book shop. They are making available the latest Bestsellers.\n\nThe technology driving the service is also pretty involved, says Usman. Users signup, browse our collection, and select books which they like. These books are added to a queue and are automatically delivered based on the priority chosen, availabilty and plans etc. Significant resources have also gone into developing and refining these details.\n\nUsman and his mates believe they are offering a service which addresses a real need. And if it doesn\u2019t work out what the hell? He says he will end up with a few thousand quality books to read!:-)\u00a0 I hope to have Usman as a guest on ITLoW next month once he has gone through the beta launch and got some initial input from local customers.\n\nMeantime go visit the site, become a member, borrow some books and tell us what the experience was like. I am very possessive with my books but I don\u2019t really want to keep most of the best sellers and novels that I read so perhaps The Readers Club can solve the problem I face with the lack of space on my bookshelf. And I won\u2019t have to buy the novels in future. I can just get them from The Readers Club and return them. So Usman I wish you luck with this venture and i hope to see those other projects materializing soon.\n\nIf you are interested in finding out about the activities of The Readers Club and get information on the new books that they are adding on, visit their Facebook page.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The Readers Club \u2013 serving a real\u00a0need?"},

So, although I would have liked to have had my friend Mohammad Sohail (co-Founder of TPS) in the studio as well, a conversation with his Global Head of Business Development was the next best thing.\n\nIn this episode of \u201cIn the Line of Wire\u201d, Shahzad talks about how it felt to win both the local and the regional Award, the complete experience of taking part in the APICTA event and working with the P@SHA Chairman, some CEC members and the participants, to put on the best show on record for Pakistan at APICTA.\n\nShahzad also gives us the history of\u00a0 TPS which was originally called Transaction Processing Systems, a modest start, its growth and its current strategy. This is one of those companies that has grown steadily through the years. They now have 110 customers in 29 countries and the list continues to grow.\n\nThe latest implementations are in places like Cameroon and Congo which not many local (or international companies) have explored. As Shahzad points out, new markets take a lot more effort, and a great deal of patience is required for your efforts to bear fruit. But it is worth it in the end. The long term strategy of not putting all your eggs in one basket, and developing less fertile markets, while you continue to benefit from those where you already have a large market share, pays off \u2013 as it has for TPS. Shahzad says he is willing to work with other companies \u2013 share the experience they have had in Africa, so that others can bypass the learning curve and get straight into the building of relationships and the sales cycle. I suggest some of you take him up on it.\n\nHe also talks about the reality of the recession and how TPS is dealing with it, how some of their long-term strategies are helping them through the worldwide downturn. I think sharing these stories and learning how everyone is coping is helpful for the entire industry. Some have been impacted harder than others, but together we will find it easier to recognize opportunities that are created during these lean times, and take advantage of them.\n\nWatch Shahzad Shahid Global Head of Business Development at TPS on this latest\u00a0 episode of In the Line of Wire.

The A.T. Kearney index ranks the top 50 countries worldwide for locating outsourcing activities including IT services and support, contact centers and back-office support. Countries are measured on 43 different attributes related to financial attractiveness, people and skills availability and business environment.\n\nThe 2009 A.T. Kearny ranking has surprised some people because of the current instability in certain parts of Pakistan. However, those who are working with Pakistani Outsourcing companies do not find it surprising at all. Despite the instability, Pakistani outsourcers (whether it be outsourcing companies or freelancers who work in the Rentacoder space), have shown over the years that, despite power breakdowns and political problems, they\u00a0 have not let this impact their ability to deliver quality services on time and on budget.\n\nMany of you will remember that even subsequent to the Marriott blast in Islamabad, when the Evacuee Trust STP was very badly damaged, IT organizations did not suffer any downtime because they had Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans in place. Large organisations like LMKR and Ovex Technoligies, and smaller compaies like Ikonami, Jin Technologies and Cogilent Solutions were all up-and-running within hours of the disaster over the weekend. Many of their customers in the US and elsewhere did not even realize what had happened. I remember one CEO telling me that his US client had remarked \u201cHow do you do it? We are still not 100%\u00a0 operational after Hurricane Katrina \u2026 and look at you guys\u201d.\n\nExpertise of Pakistani IT companies has also continued to improve as they work with clientele in various markets and consistently meet customer expectations. I am proud to be a part of this industry and I have faith that the innovation that we have seen over the past years is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nTechLahore, one of my favourite techblogs, has also put up a post regarding this article which is well worth reading.\n\nLet us all go and post some positive comments on the Businessweek article \u2013 and if we can get our customers to do so, it would be even better.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Pakistan amongst top 20 outsourcing\u00a0destinations"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2009/06/05/main-adakara-banun-gi/", "text": "Main Adakara Banun Gi is a play being staged at The Arts Council from June 6 \u2013 9, 2009 from 8:30 pm \u2013 11:00 pm. It is a two-person cast featuring Sania Saeed & Ehteshamuddin. Tickets are available at The Arts Council, Agha\u2019s Supermarket and Raintree Spa at The Forum.\n\nThe play has been inspired by \u2018Educating Rita\u2019\u00a0 and is written by Baber Jamal. It revolves around two individuals, a young female student (Sania Saeed) who hails from the Peela (yellow) school culture and is eager to learn acting, and another a veteran actor and teacher (Ehteshamuddin).\n\nThe production is being held as a fundraiser for the Rotary Club of Karachi who will use the funds to provide artificial limbs (a la Jaipur Foot) to those who need them. These will be provided free of charge to those who have lost their limbs due to disasters, disease or amputation.\n\nHaving seen many of Sania Saeed\u2019s plays, we all know what a versatile and talented actress she is \u2013 she has been in plays like Zebunnisa, Aahat, Kya Khoya Kya Paya, Balcony, Khamoshian, Jhumka Janan and many others.\n\nI have met Sania Saeed a few times in the past and have always been impressed by her bubbly enthusiasm, her commitment to any task that she takes on, her passion for theatre and the arts, her down-to-earth nature, her amiable personality and of course her intelligence.\n\nWhen Rabia Garib, Editor-in-Chief of CIO Pakistan, asked bloggers if they would like to get together with Sania Saeed to talk about her new play, I jumped at the opportunity and suggested to Rabia that we should put together a special segment of \u201cIn the Line of Wire\u201d in which we could have Sania talk about her play, about theatre in general, and about her perception of technology. Rabia and I then decided that the other bloggers who were coming over \u2013 Jamal Ashiqain, Fariha Akhtar and Sana Saleem \u2013 should all be co-hosts of this episode of ITLoW. The more we thought about it, the more excited we got.\n\nThe set was changed a bit to accommodate Sania, all the hosts and Shahzad Qureshi (he was there representing Rotary Club of Karachi and NOT Tohfay.com). And voila we were on the way!\n\nWell maybe not quite. Since Shahzad had been pulled out from another commitment, it took him forever to show up. We didn\u2019t really mind because we got a chance to talk informally with Sania and learn more about what makes her tick.\n\nShe is such a delightful young woman. We talked about everything \u2013 from her 7 cats, to her belief that technology had become very invasive, to her need for\u00a0 private space and alone time and so much more.\n\n\n\nOne of the things we learnt about her was that she couldn\u2019t have an effective conversation on the phone unless she knew the person she was talking to and could visualize them. Her best communication took place when she was face-to-face with someone.\u00a0 Sania is a very private person and yet she doesn\u2019t come across as such. She always has a ready smile and she chatted with us with such ease that it felt like we had known her for the longest time.\n\nShe told us stories about people coming up to her at her neighbourhood supermarket, mothers wanting babies to be photographed with her, old women associating her with a character she had played, people in general who had grown with her. It was amazing, Sania said, when she realized how her acting, the emotions the parts she played evoked, and how a smile or a lack of one can mean so much to someone else. It makes an actor realize the level of responsibility he or she has.\n\nSania has been acting since she was a child and she takes her profession very seriously. We asked her how difficult it was to play a role, to get into character. Did she actually become the person she was playing? Her answer was that she lived with the character, identified with the character, became at home with the character but she didn\u2019t actually become the character. What we hadn\u2019t realized was how difficult it must be for an actor to stop being the character they were playing, to let the character go, to walk away.\n\nI hope you enjoy our conversation with Sania Saeed. We certainly did. And if you are a Karachiite, or happen to be in the city this weekend, do go and watch the play \u201cMain Adakara Banun Gi\u201d. It is on from June 6 \u2013 9 at The Arts Council in Karachi from 8:30 pm \u2013 11:00 pm.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Main Adakara Banun\u00a0Gi"},

She shocked quite a few people in the 1990s when she made a radical and controversial decision to end the tenure system, abolish academic divisions and fire a lot of professors. This slashed budgets and took Bennington onto a completely new path by reinventing liberal arts education.\n\nFifteen years later it appears that the move has paid off. Bennington\u2019s emphasis on cross-disciplinary, hands-on learning has attracted a large number of students to the small college, and has resulted in a vibrant environment for a new kind of learning.\n\nLiz Coleman believes that radical reform is necessary in higher education. Her idea is that higher education is an active pursuit. In fact she says it is like a performing art. Her vision calls for lots of one-on-one interactions between professor and student, deep engagement with primary sources, highly individual majors, and the destruction of the traditional academic department. It\u2019s a\u00a0 goal that is not easily achieved and requires a lot of hard work.\n\nColeman does not think that the US is doing itself any favours by pushing kids into narrow areas of study. To address the\u00a0 problems that the world faces today, she thinks it is extremely important to make education truly dynamic by combining all areas of study thus producing well-rounded individuals. Isn\u2019t that something that many of us in this country believe as well?\n\nColeman is the ninth president of Bennington College. She graduated with honors from the University of Chicago, where she was a Ford Foundation scholar. She then went on to do her Masters\u2019 in English and American literature at Cornell University, where she was a Woodrow Wilson fellow. She received her PhD with distinction at Columbia, where she was a Woodbridge and President\u2019s fellow. Liz Coleman\u2019s vision of a liberal arts education has gained for her recognition far and wide.\n\nThis talk that she recently gave at TED is really worth listening to.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Reinventing liberal arts\u00a0education"},

Having worked for 10 years in the US market with employers like NCR Corp and Experian in senior technology management positions, he returned to Pakistan in 2007 and is involved with setting up a Credit Bureau here.\n\nThroughout his years abroad, he has maintained a connection with Pakistan\u2019s IT industry and has contributed through articles and seminars on jobs and\u00a0life in USA, technology trends and hot sectors as well as career planning and management.\n\nIn this episode, he talks about how he thinks the IT industry here should position itself, how innovation will be driven by customer needs and what we should do collectively to find a niche for ourselves instead of following the lead of other nations whose demographics and strengths are different from ours. Better to focus on what we do well and excel in those areas.\n\nNauman also thinks that it is extremely important for us to have some truly global successes so that there will be role models for younger companies to follow. He is therefore working with some companies, mentoring them, helping them to raise capital, introducing them into the US market and trying to take them global. He is working with a few companies at a time and will work with P@SHA to identify other companies that he thinks he can assist.\n\nNauman Sheikh is generally a person who wants to help.

We don\u2019t think it is our right to ask what they need the data for, how they are going to protect it, who will have access to it and what will they do with it once they have finished using it.\n\nWhy don\u2019t we think about these things? Is it because we are very trusting? Is it because we believe that the data is actually needed by these organizations and we are sure they will keep it secure? I must admit that I thought that way for a very long time. But then quite recently I started asking questions when registering at a hotel or for a conference or even when filling out a form on a website. It just seemed wrong that so much information about me was available to so many people.Why did they need it? How much of it was essential? What would happen if I refused to share it? Could something be done at policy level to ensure that my right to privacy was protected.\n\nSo what is Privacy and why is it important? I put this question to Simon Davies, Director of Privacy International, on the sidelines of a Privacy workshop in Bangkok last week. Here is what he had to say:\n\nVickram Crishna, who was also a participant in the workshop decided to joint me on the interview panel and asked Simon Davies and Gus Hosein what role industry was playing or should play to ensure that the privacy of individuals was protected. Let us see what Simon and Gus had to say:\n\nSince 9/11 our privacy has been invaded even more under the guise of national security. I asked Simon and Gus if this was not in fact necessary for our own safety. This is what they said:\n\nHaving talked with the experts, I thought I would turn my flip video toward Vickram Crishna who was one of the participants from the region. I asked him why he was at the Privacy Workshop and why he thought it was important for us to focus on this at all. Here is what he had to say:\n\nThe Privacy International website gives us an overview of what Privacy is.\n\nPrivacy is a fundamental human right. It underpins human dignity and other values such as freedom of association and freedom of speech. Privacy is recognized around the world in diverse regions and cultures. It is protected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and in many other international and regional human rights treaties. Nearly every country in the world includes a right of privacy in its constitution. At a minimum, these provisions include rights of inviolability of the home and secrecy of communications. Most recently written constitutions include specific rights to access and control one\u2019s personal information. In many of the countries where privacy is not explicitly recognized in the constitution, the courts have found that right in other provisions. In many countries, international agreements that recognize privacy rights such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the European Convention on Human Rights have been adopted into law.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "An attempt to demystify the concept of\u00a0Privacy"},

I received an invitation yesterday from the Ministry of IT in Islamabad asking me to join them in the WTISD celebrations at the Marriott in Islamabad. The programme consists of a Video message from the Secretary General of the ITU and a welcome address by my friend Pervaiz Iftikhar CEO of the USF.

I am copying below an email from Suzanne and I hope that all of you will actively participate.\n\nSuper Technologies, Inc. and several of its friends such as P@SHA, the government of Pakistan, Interconnect Partners, Multinet Private Ltd, SATC, Foresight Technologies, Gerry\u2019s, the Computer Society of Pakistan and others invite you to participate in ITU\u2019s\u00a0World Telecom\u00a0Day with the very important theme of Protecting Children in Cyberspace in a unique manner that will last for decades. For details on how to participate, go and view the invitation video and the blog We are looking for those who are participating in World Telecom Day in Islamabad and other cities in Pakistan to record video of themselves, the Ministry, other companies, families, parents, entrepreneurs, and other individuals about Protecting Children in Cyberspace and then post the videos to http://www.youtube.com or http://www.viddler.com and be sure to tag the videos like this: world telecom day, pakistan, protecting children in cyberspace. Let us know at rehan@supertec.com what you do so that we can publicize further via blogs and press release. If you would like for us to send a professional to an office to create this video, please contact rehan@supertec.com suzanne@supertec.com for this. May 17 is World Telecom Day, but we can continue through May. Let\u2019s work together!\n\nI am interviewing some young people today to get their views on the subject \u2013 using my flip video of course- and I will certainly put up the videos on youtube as Suzanne has suggested. I think we should actively participate and voice our opinion on how our government and our society can help protect children in cyberspace. I wish some talented person would develop a theme song for us to mark this occasion. Listen to this theme song that Bangladesh has on their site.\n\nI remember one of the television channels had interviewed me once on this subject. It was then that I had done some research on the subject so that I would be able to talk about it knowledgeably. That is when I discovered Parry Aftab better known as The Privacy Lawyer or The Kids Internet Lawyer. Parry has written extensively on the subject of children\u2019s safety on the internet and also about children\u2019s privacy. One of her websites wiredkids.org provides guidelines for parents and educators.\n\nI think we need to hold seminars and workshops on the subject \u2013 both for kids and for grown-ups. Anyone want to join the initiative?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Speak up on this important\u00a0issue!"},

He has been part of the IT industry for a very long time starting with IBM where he spent decades before he joined Visionet (a wholly owned subsidiary of Systems Ltd).\n\nIn this episode of ITLoW, Ashraf takes us through a brief journey of his early years at IBM and the slow but sure emergence of an IT industry in Pakistan. He talks about the involvement of companies in consulting work and providing solutions for the Y2K problem \u2013 says it was a great time. Companies made a lot of money. Then came application development, system integration and BPO.\n\nAs a company, Systems Ltd has been re-inventing itself over the years in order to keep up with the changing requirements of customers. It has grown from a single office in Lahore, and currently has, in addition to the Lahore operation, two offices in Karachi, one in New Jersey and one in Bangalore. Ashraf talks about the need to open up in Bangalore and what the experience has been like.\n\nIn the US, Systems has about 50 high level business domain and technical consultants. In Pakistan there are business doman specialists and technical experts, developers, BPO experts. The Bangalore operation is an answer to clients saying \u201cIf you were in Bangalore\u2026.\u201d\n\nAshraf also talks about his experience in different locations; he thinks (as many of us do) that the calibre of people in the Pakistan IT sector is far superior to that available in many other countries\u00a0 \u2013 this includes our analytical skills, our ability to think through a business problem and actually provide a solution, our ability to take on a challenge, our creativity, our enterprising nature. We are not just a country of coders or service providers. He believes that the kind of work we get out of Pakistan is far superior to that which is available elsewhere.\n\nAshraf and I also discussed industry issues and possible solutions that we should be working on. Scale is one thing we have been worried about as an industry. Ashraf believes mergers and acquisitions are the answer.

Her experience therefore of the warm hospitality, the friendly people, the amazing ability to network at short notice were total eye-openers.

Her view is (and I agree with her) that the economic tsunami will result in a lot more opportunities for cost effective, quality destinaitons like Pakistan. Pakistani organisations have opportunities that they should try and capture now.\n\nOne of the ideas that came out of Leila\u2019s visit to Pakistan was that, perhaps an organisation like Samasource, can provide a screening mechanism for companies in the US who want to outsource to individuals or young companies in Pakistan. They can also help freelancers to fix their profiles on freelance sites so that they are able to attract more business. Sometimes the way a profile is framed\u00a0 or worded can makes a difference to the ability of a person to draw work from foreign outsourcers.\n\nThere is also the advantage of having a cluster approach to market access. If the business goes through one company, there is likely to be some level of faith and trust that the organisation is able to build and develop over time.\n\nSocial enterprise, social business, socially responsible outsourcing are all models for sustainable businesses \u2013 these should by no means be viewed as charitable initiatives or handouts.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Leila Chirayath Janah in an audio podcast with JA and\u00a0RG"},

Outsourcing could play an important role in driving operational efficiency in lean times.\n\nThe 2 sectors that are traditional customers for BPO are Financial Services (Banking/Insurance) and the Telecom sectors both of which are fairly well-developed and well established in Pakistan. In the Telecom market, as the market saturates we have already seen the growth stop. Survival will depend upon better customer service and quality. There will be increasing pressure to reduce operational costs. Outsourcing customer service and back-office processes would therefore make perfect sense. Currently the mobile telecom sector alone employs approximately 6000-8000 personnel in the customer service, back-office processing and related areas that could be potentially outsourced.\n\nThe Financial services sector is on a similar footing and is also facing increasing pressure on the cost side. The level of understanding of outsourcing in the Financial Services sector is not as advanced as that prevalent in the mobile Telecom sector. However, some banks have started to outsource certain functions and processes. More awareness needs to be created on the benefits of outsourcing.\n\nThe idea of holding this conference is to stimulate discussion on the benefits of Outsourcing the back-office and customer service areas as well as Help Desks and other services which do not essentially need to be done in-house.\n\nThe Keynote speaker is Mr. Faraz U.

Catcos Kids Day Care Centers have professionally trained staff and and environment that provides young children with a safe and entertaining environment.\n\nIn our discussion, Shahida also talks about the need to further connect the IT industry with the health, education, government and business sectors to try and find solutions to a plethora of problems that need to be addressed.\n\nCollaboration is the key. Together there is a lot that can be done. Instead of existing in silos we need to pool our efforts to address the needs of our communities.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Shahida Saleem talks about ICT4D on\u00a0ITLoW"},

But it was \u201cour\u201d event. How could I not go? So I got myself geared up and off I went. It took me all of 20 minutes to get to the Sheraton whereas usually it takes about 45 minutes. Traffic was thin, to say the least.\n\nI reached the hotel early to find that our partners from CIPE were already there. They had organized tea and coffee and some delicious snacks which people could have while they networked before the Roundtable actually began. We were hoping that around 30 people would show up \u2013 45 people actually did.\n\nIt was encouraging to see that there was representation from all sorts of stakeholders \u2013 from IT companies (local and international), banks, media organisations, FMCGs, ISPs, the legal fraternity, the pharmaceutical sector as well as the FIA.\n\nThe proceedings started on time with a welcome from Hammad Siddiqui, Program Manager of CIPE. This was followed by a brief opening address from me where I highlighted the fact that more and more Intellectual Property was being created in the digital domain in Pakistan \u2013 not only by IT firms but also by production houses, photographers, health professionals, education professsionals, artists, musicians and all other types of businesses. There needed to be legislation that dealt with these changes to protect the innovation that was taking place as well to ensure that the rights of individuals were safeguarded.\n\nI also spoke about the Electronics Crimes Ordinance 2008 which is going to be brought up again before Parliament. It still contains flaws in definitions and does not include safeguards for individuals and businesses. There are three things that need to happen: relevant and fair legislation needs to be enacted, the judiciary and law enforcement officials need to understand what the legislation means so that they do not ask questions like \u201cIf you still have your source code, how could it have been stolen?\u201d, and an awareness needs to be created regarding rights and responsibilities.\n\nThe star of the Roundtable was of course Barrister Zahid Jamil who spent the next hour talking about the gaps in the present legislation and why they need to be fixed. He also presented a couple of case studies of companies who had their IP stolen and the process they had followed to protect the years of hard work that had gone into the development of their product.\n\nZahid also talked about cyberquatting and gave examples of large organizations whose domain names had been \u201cgrabbed\u201d by other people who demanded large amounts of money to give them back. He also gave examples of hackers putting up pornographic or pirated content on websites of reputable organizations to either ruin their image or make money selling sub-standard medicines or other wares.\n\nHe talked about the international legislation (WCT and WPPT) that existed and that Pakistan should become a signatory to. Both the WCT and the WPPT address the challenges posed by today\u2019s digital technologies, in particular the dissemination of protected material over digital networks such as the Internet.\u00a0 For this reason, they have sometimes been\n\n referred to as the \u201cInternet treaties\u201d and have already been adopted by more than 100 countries.\n\nThe discourse that followed brought out some very important issues including the need for Privacy, Data Proetection and Data Confidentiality legislation on the one hand and frameworks and structures for the sharing and licensing of IP that was created. For instance, according to Owais Aslam Ali of Pakistan Press Foundation and PPI, if he wants to use an article that has appeared in the New York Times or The Guardian, he can do so at a very minimal fee. However, if he would like to do the same for something that has appeared in a local paper, no such structure exists.\n\nApple\u2019s iTunes has created a framework for the legal downloading of music at a cost that is affordable and yet does not infringe on the rights of musicians and vocalists, so creative ways of legally sharing content created by others are being found.\n\n\u201cThe US Defense Department is enlisting an open source approach to software development\u201d an about-face for such a historically top-down organization. In recent weeks, the military has launched a collaborative platform called Forge.mil for its developers to share software, systems components and network services. The agency also signed an agreement with the Open Source Software Institute to allow 50 internally developed workforce management applications to be licensed to other government agencies, universities and companies.\u201dDetails available at this link.\n\nPrivacy is becoming an important issue with government organizations, banks, mobile companies and everyone and their dog collecting information from individuals. We need privacy legislation so that there can be guidelines on the use and limited sharing of this information.\n\nParticipants at the Roundtable shared experiences and made suggestions. Some pointed out that in addition to legislation and enforcement, organisations should be encouraged to keep pricing in line with the country\u2019s purchasing power.Companies were also encouraged to have well-encompassing non-compete clauses as well as stringent confidentiality clauses within employment contracts, and to make employees aware of the dangers of IPR infringement.They were also advised to take precautions by securing business data online, and providing access to employees through servers, in addition to establishing other internal controls for the security and safety of\u00a0 company data and trade secrets.\n\nA set of draft recommendations were put together at the conclusion of the Roundtable discussion, and a decision was made that workshops, seminars and focus groups would be held at chambers, within organisations and at universities to create an awareness and to get consensus on the path toward a workable IPR regime.\n\nA small volunteer group was formed to move ahead with the task of forming a strategy and a pressure/lobbying group that would get the views of all stakeholders and would interact with the government to ensure that policies and legislation were in tune with the requirements of individuals and businesses.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Stakeholders get together for Business Policy\u00a0Roundtable"},

He attended the Management Conference (MANCON) that was organized a few weeks ago by Nutshell Forum where he made a presentation regarding the opportunities that Texas offered to companies from Pakistan.\n\nI took the opportunity of asking him to visit the CIO WebStudio so that I could put him under the spotlight, ask him some specific questions regarding the opportunities that existed\u00a0 and what he could do to assist companies who wanted to avail of them.\n\nIn this episode of \u201cIn the Line of Wire\u201d, Faisal explains that the majority of the trade between Pakistan the US actually takes place between Pakistan and Texas \u2013 and this includes the IT sector. He talks about how Texas is open to trade from all parts of the world and offers a number of incentives for companies who wish to open up offices there, including a tax-free base. Not only are there opportunities for Pakistani companies to get business from Texas, according to Faisal the State can effectively be used as a launch-pad for targeting business from other parts of the US and Canada.\n\nLast year there was a Pakistan delegation that went to the US \u2013 the Texas part of their schedule was organized by Faisal Amin and the TTC. Several companies have told me that the networking at the Technology Forum that was organized by the TTC was absolutely invaluable. The meetings that took place went a long way toward highlighting the capabilities that exist in the Pakistan IT industry. Some of the companies actually signed contracts while others ended up signing partnerships with organisations in the U S.\n\nApparently, according to Faisal Amin, this is the right time for Pakistani companies to re-engage with customers in the\u00a0 US who are looking for cost-effective, quality options to deal with the economic crush that the world is facing.\n\nHe is offering his assistance and that of his team to anyone who is interested in connecting with Texas companies.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2009/04/25/activating-it-brands/", "text": "For a long time it has been felt that although a significant sector of the local IT industry has been doing some amazing work, this success continues to be a well-kept secret \u2013 one of the reasons for this being that \u201cBranding\u201d \u201cPublic Relations\u201d and \u201cLeveraging Media\u201d have not been core strengths for a larger number of our companies.\n\nSo P@SHA and CIO-Pakistan decided to run an \u201cActivate your brands\u201d workshop to test the waters and see where the weaknesses were and how we could start to bridge the gap.\n\nThe workshop was run at the Sheraton in Karachi on April 22. CIO had an event there earlier in the day. We had the space and the high tea, and a space for 20-25 people. It would have been such a shame to let it go to waste so we sent out an email to P@SHA registered companies in Karachi to sign up for the workshop. They didn\u2019t have to be asked twice. The slots filled up quite quickly.\n\nThe speakers were Sabeen Mahmud (COO of b.i.t.s and Director T2F), Rabia Garib (Editor-in-Chief of CIO Pakistan) and Salaina Haroon (Director of C-Collective). I starte d the proceedings by telling participants about the branding and promotion opportunities that they were missing out on by not leveraging the P@SHA Communication vehicles \u2013 the website, the blog, the newsletter and the ITLoW webcasts, as well as all the events that could be used to good advantage. I briefly explained how they could capitalize on these opportunities and explained why some press releases and success stories submitted by companies, were not used. What is considered \u201cnews\u201d, what is not. What is likely to be\u00a0 published, what is not. There were opportunities they could avail for free, and then there were the advertising and sponsorship opportunities.\n\nMy opening presentation was followed by Sabeen talking about branding at length and explaining how she had branded T2F very cost effectively. She went through some assumptions and misconceptions that people had about branding \u2013\u00a0 Some very basic things that we sometimes tend to forget or have actually never thought about.\n\nIt was an interactive session (no the participants were not allowed to sit back and relax). Some of the concerns included the unavailability of advertising agencies who actually understood the tech sector \u2013 \u201cNone of them really get it\u201d said one participant. \u201cI actually have to sit down and work with them on the mechanics of the entire strategy \u2013 and I am not a brand expert!\u201d Some solutions were discussed which included more hands-on one to one workshops and the development of cost-effective packages for companies.\n\nSabeen\u2019s presentation was followed by Rabia Garib\u2019s. Rabia spoke about how to work with the media, how to actually manage them so that they would talk about you, would interview you, would give you the mileage that your organization needs.\u00a0Her presentation was simple but very interactive. She got participants to give elevator pitches on how they would introduce their companies to a media person, showed them how they could grab the attention of the interviewer so that he/she would be prompted to ask a few more questions instead of moving on to someone else. There were additional tips and tricks on managing the media and getting the most out of them.\n\nThe last woman speaker (yes you do see how I conspired to ensure that all the speakers at this workshop were women!) was Salaina Haroon who had some extremely valuable input on how IT companies could use PR cost effectively to market their products and services and build relationships.\n\nThe workshop went on for an hour longer than it was supposed to, and people hung around after it was over simply to pick the brains of the Workshop Facilitators. Some people had to leave early so you will not see them in this group photo that was taken as an afterthought.\n\nWhat came out of the workshop was that there needed to be a more detailed session where we could take a couple of companies as case studies and actually work thorough a branding strategy with them. This would be a good learning exercise for the rest of the companies. The next workshop is expected to be held in Lahore \u2013 date to be announced soon.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Activating IT brands"},

There are so many Pakistanis that live overseas who constantly worry about parents or other family members back home. They feel helpless when they can\u2019t be there to lend a helping hand. So MamooinPakistan must have come as an answer to their prayers.\n\nI hadn\u2019t realized the total scope of the services that Maamoin Pakistan offered until I spoke with Mehdi Hasnain and Shahzad Qureshi, the CEO and Chief Resource Officer of Tohfay Inc, the parent firm.\n\nIn this episode of \u201cIn the Line of Wire\u201d Shahzad and Mehdi tell me that people ask for (and receive) all sorts of services \u2013 including getting copies of birth certificates, selling and buying real estate, making marriage arrangements, taking people for medical check-ups and even saying fateha (prayers) at gravesites on behalf of those who are too far away. Their business model was simple. They recognized a need and fulfilled it, after which they didn\u2019t wait around for customers. Unlike those who believe \u201cbuild it and they will come\u201d, they spent a significant amount on marketing online and on ethnic channels in the US \u2013 Geo, ARY, PTV. And it worked.\n\nWith Tohfay, they have been very successful indeed. People have sent not just flowers, sweets and the like to their families back home, they have sent motorbikes, airconditioners and now the number one item is going to be generators. Imagine that!\n\nMehdi and Shahzad also talked about how they met, how 6 partners got together to launch Tohfay. A lot can be learned from the way these young people have formed and run their business. They wrote down everything, defined roles for each of the partners, brainstormed and included in their agreements the possible exit strategies for any partner who wished to leave, what would happen to their stake, how disputes would be settled, etc etc. We sometimes hear of founding partners having disagreements and businesses having to fold up because nothing had been agreed to or worked out when the companies were formed.\n\nWith the success of Tohfay in the US, the partners have decided to launch a version for Pakistan. They have, in addition, launched other ventures like ShaadiWaadi and Doodhpatti. They believe that all these are answers to the need of the market. And they don\u2019t intend to stop here. They have many more ideas, and they will continue to implement them one at a time, ensuring the quality of service that their customers have come to expect from them. Good luck guys.

But the way they have told their story in comic form, won me over. The interface is also a clean, refreshing one. I abhor war, and violence of any kind turns me off, so talk about battalions and annihilations, is certainly not something that is to my liking. However, these kind of games do exist and people love to play them \u2013 especially young men. That is a fact and I know that. Maybe these guys believe that by venting their violent tendencies online, they will be cool individuals in the real world. I can dream, can\u2019t I?\n\nThe developers of Varsity Heroes describe themselves\u00a0 in these words \u201cwe mainly exist so you can feed your Napoleonic complex, rally your university spirit, annihilate all opposition in cold blood, gloat at your adversaries, laugh and point, kick them in the shins, go Spartan on their b*tts, build minarets of skulls\u2026.\u201d And then they go on to say that they are peace activists. Hmmm.\n\nSo what is Varsity Heroes? It is essentially a social networking website, but with a twist \u2013 and boy, what a twist!\n\nThe Concept: Varsity Heroes claim they are exactly like Facebook except for one difference: you can only interact with a rival group by conquering them. So for example, in Varsity Heroes, FAST and LUMS won\u2019t poke/priv msg/write on each others\u2019 walls. They\u2019ll only be able to conquer each other.\n\nHow it happens: Being a LUMS alum, Hassan Baig says he already knew that strategy games like World of Warcraft, etc. are played quite passionately and addictively at lums, giki, fast etc. People love them. So he says they decided to use a similar interface for their game. Check it out here.\n\nYou will see the LUMS campus as the battle arena. This is essentially the \u201cmap\u201d over which the game is played. In its current incarnation, GIKI and FAST have invaded LUMS campus and are trying to conquer it.\n\nIn the future, they say they will have other university campuses as the staging ground (or even popular landmarks). Also, anyone is welcome to get in touch with them to have their university included!\n\nThere\u2019s also a huge teamwork element to this game, since only a university which\u00a0 bonds\u00a0 on the game front, can actually win. Otherwise, everyone would end up attacking in a scattered fashion without a \u201cwar\u201d strategy in place.\n\nCurrently Varsity Heroes is running an external beta and are looking to launch in all Pakistani universities once they\u2019re done.

From the moment I met Adnan, I could sense that this young man was going places. He is intelligent, is extremely enthusiastic, excited and passionate about whatever he does and tends to think through everything analytically before coming to a decision or a conclusion.\n\nAdnan Haider is a graduate of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology (SZABIST), worked in Pakistan as a technical specialist for IBM \u2013 focusing\u00a0 on computer storage solutions, before proceeding for his Masters in Engineering Management (MEM) from the Duke University Pratt School of Engineering under a Fulbright Scholarship.\n\nWhile at Duke, Adnan was part of the ImaGyn team that won a US$100,000 prize\u00a0 to develop a device to facilitate cervical cancer prevention in the developing world. The device, the \u2018Cerviscope\u2019, is a portable colposcope that will cost roughly 95 percent less than comparable technology used in US-based hospitals.\n\nCervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among women. Over 260,000 women die every year from this disease with 80 percent of these cases occurring in the developing world. Although cervical cancer is highly preventable, the problem is neglected by most public health organizations.\n\nIn his conversation with me on the set of \u201cIn the Line of Wire\u201d, Adnan says that for him, entrepreneurship is more than just about making money and creating jobs. It is about making a bigger impact on the lives of others (didn\u2019t we hear the same thing from Imran Zia?).\n\nHe said the reason that his team was able to come up with a prize-winning idea at Duke that resulted in an actual product being developed, was because they were part of a strong inter-disciplinary environment. He thinks that is one of the basic things missing in most local universities. Business plan competitions, in his opinion, should be structured so that they are not mere academic exercises. They should result in projects that attract investment and result in solutions to problems that communities or businesses are looking for.\n\nAdnan is also the co-Founder of Lootmaar, an online marketplace for Pakistan. In this episode of ITLoW, he talks about where Lootmaar is today, what their\u00a0 plans are, and some of the challenges that he and his partner Noman Turab have faced along the way, as well as some of the lessons that others can learn from.\n\nAs you will no doubt note from my conversation with Adnan, there is so much that all of us can learn from kids like him. Why is it that people who are older always feel they know best, that they are the ones who are able to set directions, to show the way.

At the end of the journey, my mind was full of new ideas of the possibilities for innovation all around us, and the enormous potential that exists here.\n\nIn this episode of \u201cIn the Line of Wire\u201d, Imran talks with me about the ICT-policy-in-the -making. He also discusses the current status of the Pakistan IT industry and where he thinks we are headed. The role of P@SHA and the government is very clear in his mind and he makes some suggestions that he believes will put Pakistan on the road to economic success.\n\nBut before we get into all that, how about a little bit of background information? Imran is the current Chairman of P@SHA and the CEO of Vahzay Limited. He is also Adjunct Assistant Professor at FAST NUCES Lahore.\n\nHe has an MBA\u00a0 in Finance and Entrepreneurship from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, USA; an MS in Computer Engineering from Cornell University, USA; and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from UET Lahore.\n\nImran has over 15 years of working experience in the hi-tech industry in the US. He has held senior managerial positions in sales, consulting, product management and product development at Oracle, Altera and other hi-tech companies. At Oracle he was recognized for his contribution to the sales and consulting teams and was nominated to Club Excellence on two separate occasions; an award was given to the top 10% performers in Oracle sales and consulting.\n\nImran is a serial entrepreneur who has started software companies both in the US and\u00a0 in Pakistan. His areas of interests are financial analysis, entrepreneurial ventures, corporate governance and economic and policy analysis. His passion for entrepreneurship dates back to his business studies at Chicago GSB where his team won the prestigious annual New Venture Challenge.\n\nImran believes that entrepreneurship is a disease and that once you catch it, you are stuck with it for life. His wife thinks of entrepreneurs as \u201cdamaged goods\u201d \u2026 hmmm. His take on entrepreneurship is that kids, or even grown-ups, should not become entrepreneurs to make money. That should not be their primary motivation. They should want to become entrepreneurs because it is a passion, it is what they live and breathe,\u00a0 because through something they develop, they will create value for millions of people \u2013 something that will have great impact. It should make a difference in the overall scheme of things. If they can accomplish that, people will buy the product and the money will eventually come. There is no hurry, he says.\n\nLet\u2019s go watch Imran Zia and see what more he has to say.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The Chairman of P@SHA on the set of\u00a0ITLoW"},

I read an article a few weeks ago which stated that IDG Ventures India was partnering up with Microsoft India on the BizSpark program that was also launched in Karachi and Lahore recently. But there is difference in the two programs \u2013 a MAJOR difference. My question is why. What am I ranting about? I will tell you.\n\nThe Microsoft BizSpark program that has been launched in Pakistan entitles startups to some free Microsoft software and mentoring and coaching from partners which include P@SHA, TiE and MITEF and TAN.\n\nHere is a detailed description of what they are offering in India according to The Financial Express, Bangalore,\n\nIn a bid to provide access to entrepreneurial, technology and financial resources in one place to accelerate the success of high-potential technology startups, IDG Ventures India and Microsoft India announced an \u2018Early Stage Funding Program\u2019. This partnership will offer dual benefit to the startups registering for Microsoft BizSpark wherein they will get a funding of up to 25 crore rupees by IDG Ventures and access to Microsoft suite including the latest tools and technologies at no cost. The program is open to technology companies that are under three years old, and whose annual revenues are less than Rs 5 crore (US D 1 million). Companies meeting these eligibility criteria will be offered access to development software through Microsoft\u2019s BizSpark program; and asked to send their business plans to IDG Ventures for evaluation. Startups that meet the investment criteria of the VC will be provided access to funding of up to Rs 25 crore.\n\nAccording to the article, this has already impacted about 200 startups in India. Microsoft and IDG Ventures believe that in the current difficult scenario, this support in terms of development software, the right amount of funding and hand-holding will make a real difference between success and failure of young technology companies. Both organisations are showing their commitment to India and to innovation in the Indian ICT sector by investing heavily at a time that this help is really needed. They intend to evaluate upto a thousand companies. Wow! Yes that certainly shows real commitment. Good for the Indian startup scene. I wish them luck.\n\nHowever, my question to Microsoft and IDG Ventures is: Why not Pakistan? We have some wonderful startups, no dearth of talent, a knowledge of cutting edge technologies and a stream of proven successes. So why not invest in innovation here? Why not really support the startup scene in Pakistan by committing a percentage of the amount that is being invested in Indian startups? I would love an answer \u2013 and if there\u2019s action, that would be even better!\n\nSales offices are a great way to initiate a presence in a country, but isn\u2019t it about time for multinational IT companies to show significant commitment to Pakistan by starting research and development facilities, by bringing work here and by investing in innovation in this country? Shouldn\u2019t we raise our voices and stand up and be counted? It is about time.\n\n", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Why aren\u2019t they doing this in\u00a0Pakistan?"},

The Rockefeller-Snowe Bill of course introduced by Senators John Rockefeller (D-W. Va.) and Olympia Snowe (R-Maine). This Bill mirrors similar bills introduced in less democratic ways in South Asia.\n\nThe Bill gives President Barack Obama (or any US President) the ability to control the internet. He can apparently declare a cybersecurity emergency thereby shutting down the Internet, or at least limiting Internet traffic on particular networks that he considers critical \u2013 in the interest of national security. Of course it would be too much to expect the Bill to define what a cybersecurity emergency is. It seems the definition will be left to the President. Amazing!\n\nAaaaah but that\u2019s not all. The Bill also grants the Secretary of Commerce \u201caccess to all relevant data concerning networks without regard to any provision of law, regulation, rule, or policy restricting such access.\u201d So the Secretary of Commerce can monitor or access any data on a private or public network? Yup.

I am, therefore, not for a moment suggesting that we play ostrich, hide our heads in the sand, or close our eyes to the issues that need to be addressed.\n\nHaving said that, isn\u2019t it equally true that we should open our eyes to some of the good things that are taking place, or have taken place in the last few years? I remember putting together a post in October last year which was entitled \u201cThis too is Pakistan\u201d.\n\nWell, recently our friend \u201cTech Lahore\u201d put up a post \u2013 Postmodern Pakistan \u2013 which looked at some of the growth and developmnt that has taken place in this country in the recent past. He also asked what would happen if we managed to achieve the following:\n\n1) 100% literacy, up from the current 50-60% levels\n\n 2) Completely indigenous power production for 100+% of our needs\n\n 3) Reduction in population growth to 1.2%, with further annual reductions from there on\n\n 4) Control over fringe nihilist elements let loose in our society by X, Y and Z.\n\n 5) Impenetrable external defences\n\n 6) An economy that produces a trade surplus\n\n 7) A quadrupling of GDP (and per capita income)\n\n 8 ) Strengthened institutions; parliament, military, judiciary, executive, law enforcement etc.\n\n 9) A culture of citizen contribution; better tax collection, more community involvement\n\n 10) Tier-1 infrastructure; roads, flyovers, underpasses, dams and more.\n\nIn his post, he analyzed all 10 points and suggested that they are all in fact achievable. The post, and his assumptions, have resulted in a lot of discourse on his own blog and on Pak Tea House, where it was also posted.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all! He managed to set off Jawwad A. Farid, who sometimes disappears from the blogosphere for weeks. On reading TechLahore\u2019s post, Jawwad was motivated to write not one, not two, but as many as five posts! Yikes!

If you have had the chance to spend some time chatting with Zak, or you know of some of the things he has done over the years, you will no doubt understand what I mean.\n\nSome may not view him as the epitome of success simply because he has not accumulated millions of dollars but, in his book, just making money was never what it was all about.\n\nAs he himself points out, he lives by Buckminster Fuller\u2019s dictum:\n\nWell, Zak obviously decided he wanted to make sense. He ran away to sea when he was 17 and became a Master Mariner (which, by the way, involved a lot more study than college did).\n\nFrom a Captain in the merchant navy to a Technology Consultant \u2013 the switch happened 20 years ago when Zak decided to change career tracks and began to introduce the use of\u00a0 Technology in Education in Pakistan, eventually pioneering New Media in this country as early as the late eighties.\n\nHe started the first New Media Department at the Hamdard Institute of Information Technology, Karachi \u2013 where New Media was taught as a subject for the first time. He opened up the minds of his students and created in them an excitement and a passion to discover and explore. He taught them that to be good technologists, an understanding of design, form and content, an understanding of how things worked, how to conceptualize solutions to problems that existed, were all very important. He got his students to question and to think rather than accept whatever he fed them in terms of knowledge. Many of us, who sat in his class as observers, wondered why we hadn\u2019t had such a teacher when we were in school. It would certainly have made learning much more interesting and a lot more fun.\n\nZak is able to talk on any subject more knowledgeably than any PhD I have ever met. Of course the subject must interest him enough for him to have done indepth research on it. I have heard him converse on a variety of diverse topics from music to electronics, literature to religion, philosophy to science, photography to art, etc etc. There is nothing the man does not know. :)\n\nMy interview with Zak required very little effort on my part.

Who wants to pay for yesterday\u2019s news, asks Jacek Utko in this talk at TED.com. What, if anything, can newspaper owners and publishers do to ensure its survival. Many suggestions have been made \u2013 make newspapers free, change the size, make them local or community driven or even opinion-driven instead of news-driven. Perhaps they should only serve niche areas.\n\nJacek Utko is a very talented award-winning Polish architect turned newspaper designer. He believes that design can be the saviour for the newspaper industry. He has redesigned several newspapers in Eastern Europe resulting in as much as 100% increased circulation for at least one Bulgarian newspaper, and upto 35% of an increase for other papers in Russia and Estonia.\n\nIn this talk Jacek Utko suggests that in order for newspapers to reconnect with their readers, they need to redefine themselves. So before he even looks at revamping the design of a newspaper, he sits down with the senior people at the newspaper to assist them in taking a fresh look at their goals and business objectives. The second step is for the content to be analyzed and adjusted in accordance with the new goals. Only then does he look at radcially transforming the design. The idea really is to improve the product completely.\n\nJacek believes that a change in design not only improves the product, it improves the workflow and the branding, and even changes the company and the people who work there.\n\nWill this kind of design and content change really save the newspaper? Or is it just going to delay the inevitable? Certainly worth pondering on.\n\nIs the survival rate for newspapers going to be different in developing countries, where some say newspapers are still thriving. Personally I am not sure they are. Those of us who are computer literate and have access to computers have stopped buying newspapers for our homes and offices. We prefer subscribing to newsgroups and newsfeeds and occasionally we pick up one of the better newspapers simply out of curiosity. If we have a preferred column in any of the daily newspapers, we read it online. Most young people never did read newspapers and now with the option of the internet where they can access news on topics which appeal to them, they really have no interest in newspapers other than looking out for employment ads on sundays \u2013 even those can be accessed through jobsites now. There was a time our parents encouraged us to read newspapers to improve our language skills. I doubt most parents would want to do that today given the state of newspapers in this country.\n\nAs for those with no access to technology, the older generation are reading newspapers and will probably continue to do so \u2013 many have turned to radio and television for a lot of the news and analysis \u2013 such as it is. The others will slowly gain access to technology as prices of desktop computers, PDAs and smart phones continues to drop. As for the illiterate population, newspapers have never really had a role to play in their lives except for one literate person in a community reading a paper out to them. The proliferation of television has reduced that to a large extent.\n\nNewspapers really do need to reinvent themselves no matter which part of the world they are published in. They will not disappear totally because there will always be a segment of the population who will want newspapers in paper form. However the commercial viability of such media will be in question as significant numbers of people access news in more interesting ways \u2013 on their computers and their mobile phones.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Can design really save the\u00a0newspaper?"},

Perhaps it is not so much the pain but the sense of loss that never goes away. If anything, I miss her more each day \u2013 as does my father, whose life has not been the same since that heartbreaking moment 6 years ago when the doctor told us that she had died in her sleep. That moment of total disbelief is carved in our memories.\n\nMy mother was such a beautiful person. Her lovely gentle smile lit up our lives and soothed our souls. Her faith in us made us believe that we could do anything we wanted to. Her sweet nature and her overall goodness made the world a special place for all those who knew her. There was a magical aura about her that appeared to protect us from everything that was evil. It was as if she made us invincible. Nothing could hurt us as long as Ammi was around.\n\nShe was our friend and our confidante. She laughed with us with uncontrollable glee and dried the tears when we were sad or hurt. She magically took away the pain and stored it away within a special corner of her heart so that it would never touch us again.\n\nWhen we were kids and came running home from school, she was always there to listen to the zillion and one stories that we had to tell. As we grew up and started working, she was there to welcome us at the end of each day. I remember that the first thing I did as I walked into the house was to go say hello to ammi, to hang out with her, to tell her how my day had gone, who had done what to whom, what had gone right, what had gone wrong. She was the bearer of all our secrets. There was no-one we trusted more.\n\nThere are very few people who are content with life, who never complain no matter what life dishes out to them. Ammi was such a person. I never heard her complain or ask for anything. She was happy with whatever she had, no matter how little that was at certain stages of her life. Even when she had to be in hospital for long periods, she was worried about the stress it put on us, rather than what she was going through.\n\nI don\u2019t think Abbaji ever felt pressured to earn more, to do more. She was always grateful that life had given her such a wonderful and caring husband and loving children. She was the perfect wife, the perfect mother.\n\nAmmi was always the glue that held us all together, and even now it is her memory that keeps us so close as a family.\n\nIt is as if she is still watching over us from her heavenly abode.\n\nThank you Ammi for the sacrifices that you made for me. Thank you for all that you have given me and all that you\u2019ve done for me.\n\nI know there were times that, had it not been for your unselfishness, my life would have been so very different, not as balanced, and certainly not as happy.\n\nThank you for giving me life. Thank you for your example. Thank you for the joy that you brought into our lives. Thank you for the love that we always felt, that we never took for granted. Thank you for being so very special. We loved you so much dearest, precious Ammi. Nothing can take your love away from us.

Of course it helps if you have a father who believes in what you are doing and decides to invest in your venture.\u00a0 Babar Ahmed, CEO of Mindstorm Studios, Lahore, is one of the lucky individuals who has just such a parent.\n\nHowever, when you are developing a video game product and it takes about 3 years, the funding does start to dwindle which is what happened in the case of Mindstorm. So what did Babar do? Like several other companies that we have featured on ITLoW, he started a services division offering design, 3D rendering, architectural walkthroughs and drawing services. In the last 8 months of so, the income from these services has supported the 20 member team and the product development division of the company.\n\nIn my interview with Babar Ahmed, he tells me a little more about the product and the vision that he has for it. The fact that it is a cricket game is in itself exciting for a country that loves its cricket \u2013 no matter how badly our team may be doing right now. We will come out of it. They surprise us when we least expect it. :)\n\nAnyway, back to the game. From the sounds of it, a lot of thought has gone into its development. It is going to be available for you to play by yourself on your desktop computer and it is also going to be available as an online game on a network where you can build teams and play against individuals and groups. The idea of a cricket portal where all the scores and records of fours and sixes and wins and losses will be available, will lead towards the building of an online community of cricket lovers and players who don\u2019t need to be fit to play \u2013 people like me for instance ;).\n\nBabar has a BS in Electrical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin and an MS in Wireless Communication, Electrical Engineering and Management Science from Stanford University. He says he has a passion for teaching and it is no wonder then that he is Adjunct Faculty at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.\n\nWhile googling for Babar, I found this exclusive interview that he gave to Planet Cricket regarding Cricket Revolution \u2013 that is, in fact, the name of the game that he is launching in the summer.\n\nAt the moment, since the feature set on the game is more or less closed, Babar says that they are working on improving the User Experience and soon they will be having a beta launch where the game will be made available to several hundred testers from around the world. I hope we at ITLoW and CIO Pakistan are included in the exclusive set of people who will have access to the game in a couple of weeks. How about it Babar?\n\nBabar is also looking at how to distribute the game \u2013 he is naturally talking with Publishers but is at the same time exploring Valve\u2019s Steam which is an iTunes equivalent for game developers. Interesting stuff! The world certainly has gone through a paradigm shift. Here is a trailer of the game:\n\nHow does Babar describe the role he plays at Mindstorm Studios? In his own words (which I borrowed from his Linked In profile), he says:\n\nInteresting young man. Entrepreneur. Engineer. Business Manager. Passionate. Talented. Excited about what he is doing. He is going to make us all proud. Good luck Babar. You certainly have got us in your corner.

I believe that a blog is a personal space and although a lot of blogs are open to public view, my blog still represents \u201cmy views\u201d on anything and everything. Whereas I do believe that anything I say as a blogger, or as a person, should be said responsibly and without any intent to cause harm to anyone else, I do not believe that a blog should be regulated.\n\nThe internet has brought about a kind of democracy and freedom of speech that never existed before. It provides anyone who has an access to a computer or mobile device and an internet connection, to have her/his opinion heard without going through the hassles of the publishing or broadcasting bureacracy.\n\nMaybe that is why it poses a threat. Why should I, a mere human being, have the right to have a viewpoint? Why should I be able to express that viewpoint? That scares people especially those who have the urge to \u201ccontrol\u201d everything, to have all power centralized in a few hands. Somehow they feel they should have the right to decide what is right or wrong, what should be published and what shouldn\u2019t, what people should know and what they shouldn\u2019t, what is kosher and what isn\u2019t, what is morally acceptable and what isn\u2019t, what is good for people and what isn\u2019t.\n\nWhat I want to know is why should this right be given to a small number of people who then have the power to control everyone\u2019s destiny \u2013 or, who at least, have the power to control the flow of information? Why is it that they are the guardians of all the knowledge that is out there?\n\nI was surprised to hear a bright, and otherwise intelligent and sensible young man, say at the last Bloggers Meetup in Karachi that those who are not educated should not be allowed to blog. Why? Does the lack of literacy mean that they have nothing to say? Does the lack of literacy (which probably has been denied them) mean that whatever it is that they have to say, will have no value? Does the lack of literacy mean that they should not have a voice or an opinion about anything? Many people I know who do not have an education, see things with a lot more clarity and lack of bias than those who have been put through a school system. They have indigenous knowledge that does not exist anywhere else. They have a viewpoint about the mess that we, the educated, have created. Why should they not have the right to communicate this viewpoint? What gives us the right to create all this noise \u2013 and why should they only have to listen?\n\nAs for regulation, it hasn\u2019t done very much for the mainstream media. Let us not try and mess with the brave new world of blogging which will be guided by the community and will take its lead from what the community considers acceptable. After all, you have the right to click and leave a blog that you find offensive, never to return \u2013 and that is a right no-one can take away from you. Let us not advocate that freedom of speech, a God-given right and a right given to us through the Constitution \u2013 no matter which country we may belong to \u2013 be taken away from us.

Mukhlis is a private rent-a-car driver in Dhaka. He picked me up from the hotel, asked me what kind of things I wanted to see or buy and then chartered out the most optimal route.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t really his ability to negotiate traffic, or bargain on my behalf with the shopkeepers in Bangla, that truly impressed me. The man earns a living driving a car. He is also a professional guide \u2013 or so he told me. He has a college education and has 6 children (he wasn\u2019t sure if there were 5 or 6 and had to count them on his fingers to be sure) \u2013 4 of them are girls and 2 boys. All of them are being educated. The girls are now in college, he told me.\n\nI asked him if he was able to make enough money to support his family. He said \u201cYes I work hard and make enough money so they have enough to eat, a roof over their heads, some pretty clothes and I give them a good education.\u201d So far so good. It is what he said next that surprised me.\n\nHe said that from the money that he has left over (hmmmmm \u2026.), he has started an NGO which offers scholarships to poor children. He then pulled out several albums in which there were pictures of him handing over scholarship cheques to young girls and boys. He has been doing this ever since he started working 20 years ago, and he intends to continue until the day he dies. He said it was his duty to help those that were less fortunate than he was and he was doing anyone any favours by doing whatever little he could do. God expected it of Muslims, he said.\n\nAs I was pondering on that, he also told me that whenever he made some extra money (which was every couple of months), he donated a fan or two to the mosques in his area. He said it made the mosques more comfortable for those who came to pray. A truly amazing character!\n\nListening to Mukhlis, as we drove through heavy traffic, I wondered about all the whingeing and whining that I heard from people who were financially much better off than this man was. I also thought about how much more each one of us could be doing for our communities. If this man could spare money to provide scholarships for children in his community, we could certainly do quite a bit more than what we are already doing \u2013 not only in terms of money but also in terms of the time, effort and thought that we put into building our communities.

However, Faisal Rahim and his team certainly pulled it off.\n\nFive companies from Pakistan, comprising about 25 delegates, participated in the event.

In this conversation, Parvez demystifies the Universal Service Fund for us, tells us why it was set up, what it is doing and what the plans are for the future. Do watch the whole episode because there are certain projects that the USF is planning to launch that could be of interest to some of you youngsters out there, or to women.\n\nIn this picture, you see Rabia loading Parvez down with all the magazines that CIO Pakistan publishes.\n\nAnd in this other picture, she seems to be horrified that he has never seen a copy of CMO. I am sure she will get get back at him by doing a cover story on him in that particular magazine.

Things have come to such a stage that now when someone mentions they are holding such a competition, all I find myself doing is shrinking back and hoping I won\u2019t be asked to be part of it.\n\nThe reason for feeling this way is that, to my mind, these events do not really accomplish very much. A few weeks of putting together a theoretical plan which the youngsters are not planning to take any further, results in an \u2018unreal\u2019 exercise \u2013 much like most final year projects at Universities. No real passion goes into it because the end objective seems to be to win, not to end up with something that is going to be a solution to an existing problem that will be implemented, and will be sustainable. Yes sure some of the mentoring and coaching is probably retained by them but not enough. It is still theoretical/academic. Both of these generic activities need to be thought through. Why can\u2019t we do something more useful, I keep asking myself?

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/highly-energized-bloggers-meetup-in-karachi/", "text": "CIO Pakistan and Badar Khushnood of Google Pakistan finally held a Bloggers Meetup at a time that I was available in the country and although the schedule yesterday was a crazy one (when isn\u2019t it?), there was no way that I was going to miss it.\n\nSo off I went to Royal Rodale at 4 pm to meet up with about 40 bloggers (and some imposters/wannabe bloggers). :)\n\nWhile we waited for the event to begin, I had a chance to chat with the bloggers who were there \u2013 some I hadn\u2019t seen for a long while, and others whom I had never met.\n\nSome of the bloggers were coming straight from work and so a little delay was understandable. Rabia Garib began the proceedings by explaining that the reason for the Meetup was for \u201cactive\u201d bloggers to have a discussion on how they could support each other, how they could help increase the number of bloggers in the Pakistani blogosphere, and how they could work together to brand Pakistan positively.\n\niFaqeer (Sabahat Ashraf) joined the event via Skype and through the Justintv stream that Rabia had set up. Ramla, Mystakool, Haris, DjFlush and several others were linked in via Twitter etc because of the unsatisfactory quality of the audio. Awab Alvi (Teeth Maestro) and I were tweeting\u00a0 some of the discussion as it was going on although some of the time we got so completely into the discussion that we stopped twittering. By the way, Awab has the most disgusting Panasonic laptop you have ever seen \u2013 strange thing is that Rabia and Ammar both fell in love with it! No accounting for taste I tell you! :)\n\nAnyway, back to the discussion. Each of the bloggers introduced themselves so that we could put names to faces and then the suggestions started pouring out. Some felt that bloggers needed to be more responsible about their projection of Pakistan \u2013 that they should only project what was positive. There was even a suggestion that some regulatory body should play a part.\n\nMany of us were dead against that. Who were we to tell any blogger what he or she should, or should not, write about. It was their personal space to do with what they please. The serious bloggers exercise a sense of responsibility, ethics and balance in any case. They research a story before posting it. They do not post sensational photographs of innocent parties, especially if they are personal \u2013 Governor Salman Taseer\u2019s families\u2019 photos being a case in point. Wheras public figures are answerable to their constituents, their families should not be targeted. If certain bloggers use their space consistently to attack particular segments of society, or people with particular political affiliations or insinuate and spread untruths, very soon their following drops and people move on to more credible sources of information. So the filtering takes place naturally.\n\nThere are some good things about Pakistan. Why do most bloggers not write about those? Why do they only focus on the negative? Fair enough. There should be balanced content out there so those of us who feel that we know of good things that are happening in our cities and in our country, we should highlight those. Let\u2019s put up more photos so people out there know that we do not live in caves, that although we are different, yet we are also the same.\n\nBatool suggested that there should be more about our culture and our music. Great. Let us either put it out there ourselves or encourage people who have a specific interest in that area, to do so. Let us help them get started if technology is a barrier. The T2F blog and Danka does show some of what is happening on the cultural scene but much more of the art, fashion, literature and culture needs to be put up.\n\nFariha and Jamash were of the opinion that social issues needed to be highlighted not because we wanted to sensationalize them but because we need to find solutions for the ills in our society. There are problems in every society. To tackle them requires creating an awareness and coming up with answers.\n\nFariha, for instance, wants to start a blog/forum on which she wants to discuss women\u2019s harrassment issues. We are not the only country with this problem. So what is the harm in talking about it and seeing what people have to say, whether it\u2019s ways to handle yourself in such situations, or helping create gender policies that are implemented in work places or whatever. Some people may even talk about organisations that are case studies of a balanced and gender friendly work environment. Others may talk about support groups that are available.\n\nSome of us are already highlighting the innovation in our technology industry. Whether it is the CIO Pakistan Webstudio (my ITLOW webcast being one of the elements that makes the webstudio so interesting), TechLahore, the P@SHA blog, my own blog, Desi Back to Desh, IT Tazee, Green & White, Babar Bhatti\u2019s blog and so many others, there is good material that is available out there. Perhaps we should be cross-linking some of what is already on blogs and websites. Tea Break, Bloggers.pk and Alltop Pakistan have aggregated a lot of the blogs from Pakistan but let each of us link to our 5 or 10 favourite local blogs so that we can create a buzz.\n\nAll Things Pakistan already exists (where there are both the positive and the negative about developments in Pakistan), Abid Beli said he had already started a blog to present the Pakistan perspective, but was still in the process of creating more traction for it. Badar Khushnood pointed us in the direction of a blog called \u201cAlive and Well in Pakistan\u201d. This is what the site owners say about their effort:\n\nFawad Butt and Ethan Casey provide independent reporting from and about Pakistan, humanizing Pakistanis for a global audience and giving Pakistanis worldwide an honest, sympathetic portrayal of their situation in the contemporary world that goes beyond the headlines and cliches, in film, print and other media such as short videos, still photography, and audio.\n\nThere were a lot of concerns about the ethics or lack of them. Awab said there was no reason to reinvent the wheel and pointed us in the direction of the Electronic Frontier Foundation which has information on bloggers rights and responsibilities. Some of this may not be relevant because of our unique laws. Maybe the thing to do is become aware of what is acceptable globally and then, if necessary, start advocacy for the same rights and protection that is available to bloggers elsewhere.\n\nAction items that were agreed to included:\n\n1. Farzal Dojki will come up with a list of \u201ctalking points\u201d about the positive thinks that are happening in Pakistan.\n\n2. Usman Sheikh will put up a wiki where everyone will add on their resolutions and resources.\n\n3. Taking more photos of people, flowers, scenery, animals, culture and putting it on Flickr.\n\n4. Tagging everything that we post so that it is available in search engines.\n\n5. Finding something positve to write about every week.\n\n6. Creating a brand that could be used for viral marketing\n\n7. When an inaccurate and negative story about Pakistan appears anywhere, doing our research and commenting on it so that the truth is out there.\n\n8. Two of the bloggers committed to adding 500 bloggers each to the Pakistan blogosphere \u2013 Ammar Yasir was one of them. I can\u2019t remember who the other one was. Good luck. I hope your powers of persuasion are good.\n\nThere was a suggestion that perhaps people who did not have an education and were not literate would not be able to contribute to the blogosphere. Nothing could be further from the truth. Podcasting allows them to have a voice, to express their opinions and to share the wealth of indigenous knowledge that they possess.\n\nOh by the way I must tell you this. We had a dreamer in our midst \u2013 none other than Salaina Haroon of CIO Pakistan. Her suggestion was that all political parties in Pakistan should set up a joint PR wing that could brand Pakistan. Errr Salaina, what are you on? Surely not just Red Bull! ;)\n\nAnthony Mitchell who has been following our tech industry for several years has sent these suggestions:\n\nReporters, bloggers, and other public figures in the West and India could be tracked and contacted to help them create more and better content about Pakistan and its people.\u00a0 The results could be maintained and updated on a closed website that would function along the lines of what an export-oriented business would set up for its sales force to track clients and potential clients. A civilian defense customer-relations-management (CRM) system would maintain contact information of outside parties, record interactions with PK bloggers, and contain notes on interest areas and the types of information that could be pushed out to outside parties\u2014with their permission (annually renewed). Outreach work could be divided up to limit the time demands on bloggers in Pakistan, provide continuity, and build bridges between people with similar interests.\u00a0 For example, offroaders in Pakistan could reach out to editors of offroad magazines and offroad-oriented websites in the U.S. and offer to provide photos, content and other information that would show American readers some of the beauty of Pakistan. These exchanges would draw more readers to blogsites in Pakistan. Technology for video conferencing provides exciting opportunities for a virtual speakers\u2019 bureau.\u00a0\u00a0 Bloggers from Pakistan can use video links to engage in discussions with civic groups in other countries. \u00a0Civic groups can include rotary clubs, churches, political parties (of all persuasions), world affairs clubs and youth groups. Pakistan\u2019s prominence in the news gives it a \u2018hipness\u2019 that can be used to its benefit.\u00a0 Through video links, students at all levels could make presentations to classes in the West and India, learning communication and leadership skills and providing a sense of relevance that is not always present in routine academic assignments.\n\nPerhaps this post has become a bit lengthy :). And I still haven\u2019t said everything I had to say. Oh well! Let me close by saying that discourse such as this is much needed. We may not always agree with each other but let us give each other the right to have a viewpoint. Let us increase the size of the Pakistani blogging community so that we have a voice but let us do so with a sense of responsibility and integrity.\n\nCredits: I have used some photos taken in this post that were taken by Batool.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Highly energized Bloggers Meetup in\u00a0Karachi"},

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2009/03/04/a-few-karachi-bloggers-meet-up-with-nick-fielding/", "text": "When Sahar Ali of Panos, who had been a colleague at the Citizens Media Commission of Pakistan, and has since become a friend, called and said she had a few friends here from the UK who wanted to drop by and chat about the state of adoption of communications technologies in Pakistan, I cleared part of my schedule for the day, to make time for Sahar and her guests.\n\nThe two guests were from imediate.org.uk. One of them was Nick Fielding. For those who have not heard of Nick, he is a journalist and writer with wide experience. As a senior reporter on The Sunday Times he covered the aftermath and implications of the 9/11 attacks, reporting from Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Far East. In 2003 he co-authored Masterminds of Terror, which has become the standard reference work on the detailed planning for the 9/11 attacks. Nick is an experienced public speaker and has carried out media consultancy work for both the British Government and commercial business. Nick blogs about Afghanistan under the name Colla.\n\nNick and Andre were in Pakistan doing some research for the Development Fund for International Development (DFID). Their focus was to find out how communication technologies are being used in Pakistan and by whom. They wanted to try and discuss ways to bring in more people into the loop \u2013 especially people from poor urban areas, towns and the rural sector. With mobile phones having penetrated into a large section of the population, one only needs to expand that base to include young people in poorer areas. Giving them access and teaching them how to use technology to communicate with others locally and internationally,\u00a0 how to create content for themselves and those around them, would be a tremendously valuable exercise.\n\nAs those who know me are fully aware, I am very excited about the way young people in this country have taken to technology and are using it in so many different ways. So I told Nick and his team about kids who are blogging, those who are earning revenue through blogging, young people who have set up companies and are developing applications for various web and mobile platforms. I also told him how we were using podcasts, Facebook and Twitter to share resources, interviews, and all sorts of interesting stuff.\n\nNick had heard of Teeth Maestro, Tea Break, ATP, Amaana, Green & White and various other bloggers and wanted to meet with them. Sabeen Mahmud whom he had also dropped in to see, organized an impromptu bloggers/tweeters mini meeting.\n\nThe above picture is of some of the bloggers who met up with Nick at T2F. Sabeen and I were there, as were Ammar Yasir of Tea Break fame, Farzal Dojki from Amaana, MystaKool, Fariha Akhtar from Ideas Hut (I think she was only there for the ice-cream), Muneer Usman and Batool. Teeth Maestro would have joined us but he was out of town till minutes before we had the meeting so he can be forgiven for not showing up.\n\nI think Nick got more than he expected from the meeting. You know how we bloggers are when we are given the opportunity to talk. We talked about everything from Policy Advocacy to political activitism. We also told him how communication technologies had been used during the earthquake and at various other times. Nick wanted to hear about the Amaana model and was all praises for the video he had seen prior to his visit here. He spoke about Tea Break and asked if they realized that they were a powerful catalyst for change in this country. Ammar Yasir could only sit and beam :). We spoke of Teeth Maestro and various other bloggers who were very active throughout the country and Nick was quite excited at how much was happening in Pakistan.\n\nHis concern still was:\n\n1. How do we bring those from the lower middle class into the loop?\n\n2. What kind of things could we empower them to do, how much technology and training could we expose them to, so that they could then take it from there and do whatever it was that excited them.\n\n3. How could we increase the use of ICT, what were the barriers to that growth and what programs could we think of that would result in something like this happening.\n\nNick also put a question to Ammar \u2013 did Tea Break know a lot about their bloggers? How old were they? How many of them were mean or women? Why had they started blogging? What would it take for others like them to start blogging? Things like that. Such details were of course not available regarding all the bloggers that are on Tea Break. Perhaps that is one of the tasks that can be undertaken.\n\nThe intent of DFID, from what I gathered,\u00a0 is to ensure that, through technology, young people (and older ones) in Pakistan are encouraged to engage with their peers locally or internationally so that an understanding can be developed of each others\u2019 culture and way of life.

As Yusuf tells us in this interview, every line of code for the technology products that Mixit has produced, was written by the brilliant team that he has put together in the development center in Pakistan.\n\nThe perception sometimes is that we do only low-end work in Pakistan but if you have been watching the ITLOW episodes so far, you will have seen for yourself that the opposite is in fact true. Companies like Mixit, whose products run on the floor of NASDAQ and other stock exchanges and brokerage houses around the world, prove yet again that Pakistani companies may be smaller in size but there is a lot of cutting edge work being done here.\n\nIn this episode of In the Line of Wire, Yusuf Jan talks about how he and his team have managed to \u201ccreate magic\u201d at Mixit Technologies, how he has retained his core team not through any high and mighty HR philosophies but through simple respect for their work, treating his employees with fairness and providing them with a merit-based, flat environment. The lack of a bureaucratic structure enables communication to take place between all members of the team and the man who is the Founder and the inspiration for many of the kids who work for him.\n\nYusuf is a very straightforward individual so, if you ask him for his opinion, be ready to hear the truth. I have consulted him often and although admittedly some of his notions can be a bit weird, he is always creative, sincere, logical and clear headed. He is also great fun to be with. He has at least a dozen ideas floating around in his head at any given time and is one of those who truly believes in work-life balance.\n\nMixit Technologies is a company that continues to grow and flourish even in these difficult times. They have vacancies for bright young people today so do look them up and join a vibrant and successful team. The team interestingly enough is a mixed bag of professionals from Sir Syed University of Science & Technology, FAST, NED, Karachi University and other universities in Pakistan all working together in a harmonious, challenging and learning environment.

We have written about it, lectured at Universities, in one-to-one sessions, on television or radio shows but have we actually done anything specific to make it happen? Not really! Talk is cheap. There is need for action.\n\nWell Viviane Reding, EU Commissioner for Information Society and Media, decided to do something rather than just talk about it. Together with several leading technology companies, the Commission organised a series of \u201cshadowing days\u201d to show young women that technology is not at all \u201cstrictly for geeks!\u201d.\n\nViviane explains the concept in this video:\n\nSo what are shadowing days exactly?

It appears that the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan now believes that there is significant potential for growth in the export of services, and that perhaps, they should look beyond textiles, rice, leather and other products \u2013 important though those sectors are.\n\nThe Ministry of Commerce has set up a Services Export Development Cell (SEDC)at TDAP which is to be \u201ca conduit for public-private dialogue for the development and enhancement of services exports of Pakistan.\u201d\n\nThere is of course a DG who has the overall responsibility for the SEDC but unfortunately he had a heart attack the day I was to meet with him (no I normally don\u2019t have that effect on people!) He is fortunately well on the road to recovery.\n\nThe gentleman I did meet at SEDC was Mr.Mujeeb Khan who is a Consultant with TDAP, has been heading the WTO Cell and is spearheading efforts at SEDC.\n\nHis background is that he has over 20 years experience working in different departments which fall under the Ministry of Commerce. He has worked as the First Secretary/Negotiator at the Permament Mission of Pakistan at the WTO in Genena where he represented Pakistan on Committees like the Committee on Agriculture (CoA), the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), Council for Trade Related Aspects of Intelllectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and International Textiles and Clothing Bureau (ITCB).\n\nIn my conversation with him, I got the impression that he has a good understanding of the IT and ITES market and its\u00a0 potential. I told him about some of the cutting edge work that is being done in this country and how much scope there was for it to grow at an enormous pace.\n\nFrom what I understood, the SEDC will undertake the role of a facilitator between the services industry and various arms of government including the ministries. They will also be looking at helping to build capacity in the services sector, assisting with quality initiatives, and the projection of case studies in the local and international markets as well as be a platform for market access.\n\nAdditionally they will look at conducting research in the five service industry sectors that have been identified as priority areas: IT, Health & Medical Services, Financial Services, Professional Services and Construction & Architectural Services. SEDC will also recommend, formulate and implement service enhancement schemes for these sectors.\n\nAll of it sounded very good and Mr.Khan seems like a nice guy with good intentions but, as he himself pointed out, it will take a bit of time for the service sector to actually believe that something is going to happen. Credibility will need to be earned. My personal opinion is that since they have opened a door, let us extend our hand of cooperation and give them a chance.

This was a few months back, and since then I have not only found it useful, it has been loads of fun too. Of course it can end up being addictive and overwhelming (what with the pokes, nudges, pictures, games, comparisons and God knows what else) so one needs to be a little selective and spend only as much time as one can allocate without letting it take control of one\u2019s life. :)\n\nBefore I got started with Facebook, friends had warned me about some concerns that they had with Facebook\u2019s policies. As I began using it, I didn\u2019t find much to complain about, in terms of obvious spamming or any kind of misuse of my posts or links. There was the odd person that I befriended who turned out to be a bit of an annoyance and so I had to wipe him off my friends list. But nothing for which I could hold Facebook responsible.\n\nImagine then my disappointment when the news broke a couple of days back, that Facebook had updated its Terms of Service. Now, the service appears to claim that any user\u2019s content is irrevocably theirs, even if the user subsequently closes his/her account.\n\nIt isn\u2019t as unsettling as it first appeared, because a lot of discussion has taken place about the kind of ownership of content a social networking site (where users intentionally upload a lot of personal materials to share among \u2013 trusted \u2013 friends as a matter of routine) ought to have. In response, the site\u2019s managers, including its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, have clarified that the modified ToS is basically to cover personal content already shared to friends\u2019 pages, and Facebook does not intend claiming ownership of these things themselves at any time.\n\nWhat a difference a few words can make! If that is all they meant, then why couch it in such unfriendly and possessive language? I don\u2019t feel at all ashamed or regretful at being upset and annoyed by the wording when I read it. It is full of very legalese terminology, but the intent seems plainly intrusive.\n\nHere is Zuckerberg\u2019s explanation: \u201cPeople want full ownership and control of their information so they can turn off access to it at any time. At the same time, people also want to be able to bring the information others have shared with them \u2013 like email addresses, phone numbers, photos and so on \u2013 to other services and grant those services access to those people\u2019s information. These two positions are at odds with each other.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t a legal expert write this out in clear and unambiguous language, if Zuckerberg can express his (service\u2019s) intent so plainly? Why must legal language be so confusing, so often? A lawyer friend of mine (no not Zahid Jamil) told me that legal language is as wordy as it is, in order to express, not clarity, but fullness.

I met a lot of young people in Lahore who have created some really innovative technology products sitting right here in Pakistan. Talking with them and learning about some of the exciting stuff they are doing, reiterated in my mind that Pakistan is indeed a place where innovation in ICT is taking place. The bright and enthusiastic young people, who have joined the ranks of older entrepreneurs, are creating a buzz and a critical mass in an industry that, no matter how much people may underestimate, refuses to go away and will one day be responsible for the enormous economic growth of this country.\n\nIn between meetings at different offices throughout the city, Imran Zia and I took a break and had a delicious lunch and a very invigorating conversation with Mannan Amin CEO of Tintash. The barbecued king prawns with garlic was mouth-watering to say the least and the Espresso much-needed. And the fresh and relaxing atmosphere of the Cafe Aylanto made it a truly perfect break in the middle of a very hectic day.

If it is something earth-shattering one understands the reason for it. After all, that is what news channels compete with each other on \u2013 bringing breaking news to you before anyone else.\n\nBut is it really justified when the news that interrupts a movie or a show you are watching is something like \u201cChaudhry Shujaat is just about to file his nomination for the Senate elections. Chaudhry Parvez Elahi is with him\u201d. Then you see a shot of the two of them waiting to file the nomination.\n\nWhat is so earth-shattering about that? Could I not have lived another moment without knowing this? Could the television channel not have waited another 10 minutes to report this news after the show was over?\n\nI think the media need to determine what is breaking news and what is not. If there is an earthquake, a hurricane or a plane crash, that is indeed breaking news. If one of our politicians has decided to call yet another press conference to say the same things yet again, that should not even be considered news, let alone news that interrupts regular programming.\n\nThis brings me to another pet peeve of mine. Why is it that whenever there is a conference or any kind of event \u2013 whether it be on Climate Change or an IT, Developement or an HR Conference, the lead story has to be some inane thing that a politican has said at the event and not something brilliant that the keynote speaker has said?

On January 24, 1984 the world changed for many of us. It is no doubt difficult for some of you to understand why those of us who used this 9\u2033 computer in 1984, were so taken by it, why it was so personal and precious to us.\n\nThe first Mac shipped with an 8MHz Motorola 68000 processor, 128KB of RAM (yes 128 KB!!!), and a 400KB floppy disk drive \u2013 it\u00a0 set us back US$2,495 (which was a lot of money in those days). 25 years later, the Mac Pro ships with two 2.8GHz Intel Quad-Core Xeon processors, 2GB of RAM, and a 320GB hard drive for US$2,799.\n\nWhat was so special about this teeny weeny computer? Why did it arouse so much enthusiasm and attract so many evangelists who have stayed with it through the years? Very simple. It empowered \u201cthe rest of us\u201d \u2013 whether we were writers, teachers, communicators or artists. The minute you turned the Mac on, you knew what to do. The first graphical user interface made the computer \u2018human\u2019 for the person using it. The introduction of the mouse, the pull down menus, and a windowing system made it so easy to use. With MacWrite and MacPaint, we could write and draw and paint.\u00a0 It led the way to us all becaming Desktop Publishers. And guess what? The Mac even spoke to us. Is it any wonder that many of us fell in love with it and with Steve Jobs and the Mac team? Do you believe Steve wore a suit then? :)\n\nThe changes that the Mac team set in motion 25 years ago have had a profound impact on how computers are used today. Apple has been a trendsetter from the get go, and it continues to be so. With the launch of every new product, it sets a new standard for others to follow. Here\u2019s to another 25 years of innovation! God bless you Steve Jobs, Woz and the entire Mac team.

When the chowkidar (watchman) went to the gate to find out who it was, he came face-to-face with one of our older neighbours. On enquiring if there was a problem, the old man stretched out a hand and gave him a tube of eye ointment and asked the chowkidar if he could help him put the ointment in his eyes.\n\nNot in itself a very strange occurrence you might think. However, as the chowkidar complied, the old man apologised for bothering him and said that he had been standing on the road outside his house for about an hour hoping someone would pass by who could assist him with this task, but no-one had and it was only then that he had resorted to ringing our doorbell. How sad is that :( !\n\nThe strange thing about all this is that the gentlemen lives with his children and grandchildren and there is always someone in the house. What I cannot understand is that they don\u2019t appear to be in the least concerned about him. They all have their own lives and interests and treat him as if he is a burden and a nuisance to have around. He is of often seen walking around on the street talking to whoever will give him the time of day, or will listen to one of his stories. I guess they think that they are doing a favour by allowing him to live with them.\n\nThese are educated people with responsible jobs. What excuse could they possibly have for treating their own father/grandfather is such a shameful manner? Do a lot of people indulge in the same kind of behaviour?\n\nI think of my parents and the love and caring that we have instinctively given them and the responsibility that we have felt for their welfare and their happiness \u2013 not because we have to, but because our hearts wouldn\u2019t let us do otherwise. This pales in comparison with the love and support that they have given us all their lives \u2013 not that one is looking at it as payback at all. However, we can\u2019t help but acknowledge that they have made us who we are. They have nurtured us and cared for us. They have brought us joy and protected us from harm.

Faisal has been writing to eBay and PayPal for the last 6 years asking the same question \u2013 and so far Pakistan, a country of 170 million, is still deprived of these services.\n\nAs Faisal points out, many of us have found ways around this, by going through friends and family in other parts of the world. But why should we have to? Why can these services not be legally available to us? Our community would like these two companies to kindly give us an answer other than \u201cyour complaint has been lodged\u201d.\n\nI understand you are someone who is immensely busy and have thousands of other important issues to deal with, but I thought I\u2019d try my luck with you. I\u2019ve been writing to PayPal / eBay since 2002 regarding issuance of PayPal accounts for Pakistan, in 2005 I started including eBay in my correspondences to include eBay accounts for Pakistan.\n\nI have never received a reply back. Twice in the past, I received a reply back (filed via customer services) that my \u2018complaint\u2019 has been lodged and PayPal will look into it. Other than that, have not gotten a satisfactory reply.\n\nThe issue \u2013 simple.\u00a0Why is eBay / PayPal not being offered for Pakistan?\n\nI just finished reading an article on your hand-on approach in\u00a0TIME Magazine (Issue 12 January 2009 \u2013 Asian Edition, Page 35, written by Kristina Dell), it simply compelled me to get on the computer and write another letter to eBay / PayPal. The article gave me hope (again!)\n\nPakistan \u2013 purely from\u00a0your business perspective may not be that big of an economy, but it surely has an economy that is larger and more active than Bhutan, Chad, Honduras, Somalia, Maldives, Rwanda, Uganda, Yemen \u2013combined!\n\nIf these countries can have the privilege of obtaining a PayPal account, why not Pakistan?\n\nAs Pakistanis cannot legally have a PayPal account, 1000s of users here circumvent the system and obtain PayPal IDs from their friends and relatives abroad to use and conduct commerce. This should be of no surprise to you.\n\nThe same can be said about eBay.\n\nLike I cited, we may not be that big on your radar, perhaps we\u2019re not even equated to a blip, but a country of 170 Million, to be blatantly ignored (you may agree or disagree on my choice of words, if the above mentioned countries can have PayPal, I\u2019d like to know what piece of legislation, law, banking infrastructure, etc. prevents eBay/PayPal from including Pakistan under your countries-in-which-you-work umbrella).\n\nPakistan\u2019s predominant trading Partner happens to be the US. Within respect to both imports and exports (discounting oil).\n\nThe first time I experienced eBay and PayPal in the summer of 2001 whilst briefly working in the US \u2013 I was mesmerized to say the least. Till date, I wish we had the privilege of conducting business on a website so many take for granted.\n\nThis is not meant to be a protest letter by any means. In fact it is one of a very humble request. A request whose time has come, and was long overdue. I have in the past cited my willingness to help, providing information or getting eBay / PayPal connected to Banks, regulators, whomsoever you would like to meet. I am, in no way proposing or advocating a \u2018role\u2019 for myself \u2013 my intention is just to help.\n\nIs it too much to think that perhaps this one letter will get the ball rolling. Or if the ball is already rolling, yield the desired result. Will this letter be tacked on your things-to-do board and actually get done with? Is this the right time to plead the case for my country?\n\nI\u2019ll end my letter with a quote from Dale Carnegie (sorry, couldn\u2019t find a befitting Irish quote) \u201cMost of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.\u201d\n\nI just want to be able to have an eBay and a PayPal account from Pakistan.

Any wonder then that as more web applications begin to emerge some of them are focusing on bringing us information regarding eating places around town.\n\nKarachiMetro, launched by Mohtashim Ahmed of Ittazee.com fame, provides names of restaurants in karachi together with phone contacts and menus for those of us who are too lazy to venture out.\n\nFoona (a word derived from a fusion of food and khana) was founded in 2006 and had an extremely good and easy-to-use interface and a great search facility. It focused on Islamabad to begin with and aimed to become countrywide. The website has been inactive for quite a while so I don\u2019t know if the developers/founders decided to abandon the project or have been busy elsewhere.\n\nLatest on the scene, and extremely impressive, is Mazaydar (meaning \u2018delicious\u2019). The idea behind Mazaydar, says Founder Obaid Ahmed (CEO of Deensoft), is to create a social platform where users can also contribute data by posting their favorite restaurant or cafe or road-side stall and posting reviews about the places that they have already gone to. The site currently allows you to browse listings in Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore. Visitors are welcome to create an account and add new listings in any of these three cities.\u00a0\u00a0 44 more Pakistani cities will be added to the portal within the next few months.\n\nThe portal is already well populated with restaurants from the three major cities of Pakistan. I found the interface to be neat and intuitive. Obaid started working solo on this project around 6 months ago spending most of his weekends planning and designing the site.\n\nAlthough\u00a0 so far it has been a one-man mission, Obaid tells me that that is about to change. He is in the process of setting up teams all across Pakistan to help promote and manage Mazaydar.com. He is also going to be creating an API for third-party developers to create mashups ontop of the data.\n\nCommunity portals like these are driven no doubt by passion but if they are to be sustainable, there has to be some way to monetize the project. Obaid has already thought that through \u2013 in addition to advertiments, Mazaydar will be providing businesses the option to sponsor a complete listing where only their advertisements, deals and coupons will show up. Businesses will also be able to signup and customize their listings by adding more information about their business and get stats on who is saying what about them.\n\nI think the fact that the portal incorporates reviews, video guides and star ratings that will be used to determine the best eateries in town for the Mazaydar Award, really makes this a very comprehensive and customer-centric site. The community will get involved, people will want to share their experiences and add interesting videos and comments. I know I will.\n\nFor people who travel on business to different cities, I think this portal will become a place to \u2018consult\u2019. I know that often when I am not in my home town, I wish I knew which restaurant to go to or to take\u00a0 people to. Mazaydar.com will make life much easier for me, that\u2019s for sure. Maybe I am asking for too much but if there could be brief location information regarding the restaurants, that would really help too. GPS/Google maps? :)\n\nGreat site though \u2013 I hope that Obaid and the team he is putting together will take this in the direction that he has envisaged. I am sure it will evolve over time with community feedback. Good luck guys!

The thing is that I have never measured success in monetary terms. Does that mean I am a success after all? Who cares? I have started a couple of ventures, put a lot of passion and hard work into them and enjoyed myself thoroughly. I have learnt from everything I have done and everyone I have met, I have made good friends along the way and I have earned enough money to have the most delicious meals in restaurants all over the world, to buy gadgets I love, to travel, to buy books and music cassettes, cds, videos and dvds and spend lavishly on friends and family whenever I had the dough. What more could one want from life? I am content with the wonderful life I have led and the delightful people I have met along the way. And if, in commercial terms, or in any other terms, other people consider me a failure, I certainly am in good company.\n\nSo my message to all aspiring entrepreneurs is: Don\u2019t be afraid of failure!

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/12/31/truly-inspirational-no-matter-how-many-times-you-listen-to-it/", "text": "Sometimes one listens to a speech for the third or fourth time and it still has a very strong impact. This address that Apple CEO Steve Jobs made at the Stanford University Commencement is one such speech. I don\u2019t know how many people have listened to it before, how much they\u2019ve learnt from it. I just thought that at the end of the year, we needed some inspiration and who better to provide it than Jobs.\n\nI wanted to highlight the three main points that he made in the speech (for those who are too lazy to go through the entire video clip). These are all parts of quotes from Steve\u2019s address.\n\nI dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? After six months, I couldn\u2019t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.\u00a0 The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn\u2019t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.\n\nBecause I had dropped out and didn\u2019t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can\u2019t capture, and I found it fascinating.\n\nNone of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.\n\nAgain, you can\u2019t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something \u2014 your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.\n\nFIND OUT WHAT YOU LOVE \u2013 DON\u2019T LOSE FAITH \u2013 DON\u2019T SETTLE\n\nI was lucky \u2013 I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation \u2014 the Macintosh \u2014 a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.\n\nI really didn\u2019t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down \u2013 that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the Valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me \u2014 I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.\n\nI didn\u2019t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.\n\nDuring the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple\u2019s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn\u2019t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don\u2019t lose faith. I\u2019m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You\u2019ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven\u2019t found it yet, keep looking. Don\u2019t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you\u2019ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don\u2019t settle.\n\nYOUR TIME IS LIMITED SO DON\u2019T WASTE IT LIVING SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S LIFE\n\n\u201cIf you live each day as if it was your last, someday you\u2019ll most certainly be right.\u201d It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: \u201cIf today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?\u201d And whenever the answer has been \u201cNo\u201d for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.\n\nRemembering that I\u2019ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\u2019ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything \u2014 all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure \u2013 these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\n\nYour time is limited, so don\u2019t waste it living someone else\u2019s life. Don\u2019t be trapped by dogma \u2014 which is living with the results of other people\u2019s thinking. Don\u2019t let the noise of others\u2019 opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/12/31/experience-sharing-session-on-entrepreneurship/", "text": "The Entrepreneurship Seminar was put together very quickly by P@SHA and MITEFP because we wanted to capitalize on the presence of Idris Kothari and Faraz Hoodbhoy in Karachi.\n\nIdris is a seasoned Silicon Valley entrepreneur and an active part of OPEN (Organisation of Pakistani Entrepreneurs of North America) and TiE (The Indus Entrepreneur). Faraz has years of experience in Silicon Valley having worked at Microsoft, NextBrick and Clickmarks and one of the Founders of PixSense. Our third panelist was Azhar Rizvi who has been a senior IT professional in Pakistan for two decades having worked with Unisys, NCR and THKS. Azhar is the current CEO of the Tech Angels Network.\n\nIdris spent a bit of time telling us what he was presently involved in at Vertical Systems Inc which provides turnkey technology solutions for the hospitality industry. He also shared with us that the worldwide Call Center for this operation was based in Islamabad and he was totally satisfied with its operations.\n\nFaraz took us through his PixSense experience, how/why PixSense had come into being, carefully pointing out for the benefit of the attendees the challenges that he and Adnan had faced especially in the early years. There were lessons to be learnt from what he said \u2013 what worked, what didn\u2019t, the frustrations, the challenges, the highs, the lows.\n\nSome of the key points that I picked up from the panelists, that I am sharing here, were the following:\n\n1. Have family and friends that you can borrow from at the outset because you will need initial capital for the first 6 \u2013 9 months simply to survive.\n\n2. One cannot be an entrepreneur part-time. It has to be a full time occupation.\n\n3. If you are married, you must ensure that your spouse is loving and understanding enough to put up with you working long hour days, seven days a week and travelling if need be.\n\n4. Be sure you love what you are doing \u2013 otherwise you won\u2019t be able to sustain it. So if you wake up one morning hating what you do, and this feeling persists for several days, then you are obviously not following your heart and it is best to quit.\n\n5. Be strong enough for 77 out of 80 VC rejections (in the case of Faraz) and more in the case of Idris. Learn from them, don\u2019t consider them failures \u2013 eventually you\u2019ll get there.\n\n6. Don\u2019t let the external noise keep you from hearing the voice in your head and in your heart.\n\n7. Find some good mentors who will guide you and be your sounding board, who will be brutal when they need to be so that you may continue on the road to achieving your goal, your dream.\n\n8. A 100-page business plan is certainly not required but do put a lot of thought into your business model, into how you are going monetize your product, how you are going to build your team, how you are going to eat and live sustain your business. The more detail you are able to put on a couple of sheets of paper, the more likelihood that you will have actually thought it all through. This could be 3 Excel sheets, a two page document or a Mind Map.\n\n9. The sooner you find your first customer, the better. If your first customer will be your guinea pig, you can afford to give him the product at cost. This will ensure that the product is workable and tested, and you will have a ready reference site to use for marketing to other customers.\n\n10. Identify a problem/ a pain point for a potential customer, and then find a solution for that pain. Just developing something that you think is cool but for which there is no identified market, will result in failure and heartbreak.\n\nThere was some discussion surrounding Raghib Hussain who is\u00a0 known to both Idris and Faraz. For those who haven\u2019t heard of Raghib, he got his BS from NED University Karachi, and an MS degree in Computer Engineering from San\u00a0Jose State University.\n\nHe was recruited by Idris as Design Engineer for VPNet, an enterprise security company.\u00a0 At VPNet, he was a key contributor to the design of the first commercial IPSec based VPN (Virtual Private Network) gateway. In his early days at VPNet, Idris told the young Raghib that in 5 years he should be aiming to get to stage where he could replace Idris and in 10 years he should be able to hire Idris.\n\nWell, the young man certainly took what Idris said to heart. He went on to work at Cadence Design Systems and Cisco Systems and he is currently the Vice President of Software Engineering & CTO of Cavium Networks which he co-founded. Cavium is a very successful company and is listed on Nasdaq. They have experience in developing high performance processors at DEC/Compaq and Sun. Cavium Networks software team has extensive experience in bringing to market leading security products at companies like Cisco, SonicWALL, VPNet & Nortel. Raghib has 19 pending or issued patents in the field of networking and security.\n\nAll in all it was a great knowledge-sharing session. Everyone left feeling that more such events should take place so as to enable a transfer of ideas.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Experience-sharing session on Entrepreneurship"},

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/12/29/ict-being-used-by-more-and-more-people/", "text": "On Christmas Day I met a couple of friends for lunch and we were discussing how technology is being used by more and more people in Pakistan \u2013 and increasingly amongst low literate and low income groups. The digital divide does of course still exist but some of the\u00a0 lines are beginning to blur as more people have access to, and are adopting, information and communication technologies with excitement and ease. We still have a long way to go but at least we are on the way. Zakintosh has related a few examples and has gone as far as to say that the \u201cICT revolution\u201d is finally here.\n\nIt would seem that this is indeed true.\u00a0 One of the young men I was having lunch with told me about his housekeeper who had access to an old PC. The housekeeper had saved some money and got hold of a cheap digital camera with which he has been taking pictures of family and friends. He then discovered how to connect the camera to the PC upload the pictures and put them up on Flickr for family elsewhere to access. Wow.\n\nIt is worth remembering that many low-income Pakistanis are working elsewhere in the world and have so far depended on phone calls or letters or audio tapes to keep in touch with near and dear ones. Photos of children as they grow up have been rare either because of the expense or due to a lack of printing facilities in towns and villages. This certainly is an easy way to be in closer touch with family. Now if only we could have cheaper broadband access across a larger part of the country, we\u2019d find more people using webcams to communicate and participate in family events over long distances, whenever they are unable to be physically present.\n\nThere is a young man working for me who has had very little education. He is honest and hardworking but has had only a couple of years of schooling. Since joining us, he has learnt to use office productivity software and scanning and image enhancement software. But more than that, it brings a smile to my face when I see him using Instant Messenger, Facebook and email. He uses Roman english on email as well as on SMS and does it quite well. If we could have Twitter, Facebook and SMS in Urdu, Punjabi, Balochi and Pushto, the adoption of ICT would grow at an even faster rate.\n\nThe other friend who was with us at lunch told us that his domestic helper has been spotted playing BlackJack and Solitaire on an old PC. And why not? Once they have access to technology and have got over the initial hesitance of using ICT, there is nothing they do in the \u201creal world\u201d that they cannot do in the virtual one. Oh okay perhaps I exaggerate. Perhaps there are a few things one cannot do online :)\n\nThe spread of electronic media to the majority of households as well as the increased use of mobile phones by all sectors of society has not only made communication easier, it has also meant that different strata of society and now not only viewing and assimilating, but are actively participating in disucssions on all aspects of our lives.

Born to an African American mother and a white father whom she never knew, Eartha suffered from poverty and abuse for most of her early life. It was by chance that she entered show business as she responded to a dare from friends and auditioned for a part in a dance performance.\n\nSo it was in the late 40s that Eartha started her career as a dancer and then went on to be one of the first multi-tasking women in show business, achieving success in a number of mediums \u2013 dance, song, film, television, broadway. A seductive woman with a come-hither voice, Eartha Kitt won the hearts of millions. Orson Welles referred to her in the fifties as one of the most exciting women alive.\n\nShe spoke four languages and sang in seven. Her greatest hit was \u201cSanta Baby\u201d. I remember listening to it hundreds of times. This number was later also sung by Janet Jackson, Madonna, Kylie Minogue and others. Other numbers that I particularly enjoyed, and that turned out to be her signature tunes, were \u201cC\u2019est Si Bon\u201d, \u201cLove for Sale\u201d and \u201cOld Fashioned Girl\u201d.\n\nThe tough life she had led made Eartha a bit hard and certainly very blunt. She suffered because of this bluntness when she was invited to the White House for a luncheon in the late sixties. Lady Bird Johnson, the first lady, asked her about the Vietnam War and Eartha responded: \u201cYou send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed. No wonder the kids rebel and take pot.\u201d It was claimed that the first lady broke into tears and this led to a subsequent negative campaign being launched against Eartha Kitt by the CIA, resulting in her getting no work and being exiled to Europe for almost a decade. She was finally invited back to the White House by President Jimmy Carter.\n\nEartha won several Tony Awards and Grammys throughout her career. She has also written 3 autobiographies.

All I can say is: take a look at Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s face and the case is made. I believe that not only is this contemplated act criminal, malevolent and barbaric, it also contains within itself a palpable joy in destruction. Power, as has often been remarked, is the great aphrodisiac, and so, it would seem, is the death of others. The Americans have the ostensible support of the \u2018international community\u2019 through various sure-fire modes of intimidation; bullying, bribery, blackmail and bullshit. The \u2018international community\u2019 becomes a degraded entity bludgeoned into the service of a brutal military force out of control. The most despicable position is that of course of this country which pretends to stand shoulder to shoulder with its great ally while in fact being more of a whipped dog than anyone else. We are demeaned, undermined and dishonoured by our government\u2019s contemptible subservience to the United States. The planned war can only bring about the collapse of what remains of the Iraqi infrastructure, widespread death, mutilation and disease, an estimated one million refugees and escalation of violence throughout the world, but it will still masquerade as a \u2018moral crusade\u2019, a \u2018just war\u2019, a war waged by \u2018freedom loving democracies\u2019, to bring \u2018democracy\u2019 to Iraq. The stink of the hypocrisy is suffocating. This is in reality a simple tale of invasion of sovereign territory, military occupation and control of oil.

Thank God for the Australians who came to my rescue \u2013 thanks Kelly, Lisa and Ian. We formed a group comprising of Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/12/24/a-surprise-visitor-2/", "text": "I was sitting in my office the other day sifting through lots of material \u2013 had a number of deadlines to meet \u2013 when there was a knock on the door and a young woman in a burqa walked in. She asked if I was Jehan Ara. I pleaded guilty to the charge. She said she needed to discuss something with me. I must admit to being a bit irritated because I was short on time and there was so much to do. I asked her why she hadn\u2019t phoned and set up a time to meet. Wrong question obviously because she told me off in no uncertain terms. Said she had been trying for weeks but my mobile was turned off. I explained that I had been out of the country. Now apparently I was on the backfoot ;)\n\nAnyway, I didn\u2019t want to chase her away because she did look extremely worried so I told her to take a seat and tell me what it was I could help her with. She said she had a Masters in Computer Science from the Karachi University, had expertise in Oracle and had worked in a local software company for about a year and a half until their project was complete which is when they showed her the door.\n\nShe was now looking for a job and wanted my help and advice. I told her I would check with some Oracle shops to see if they were hiring. With the financial sector hit so badly I wasn\u2019t sure if in the short term people were hiring as much as they had been earlier.\n\nThen she asked some very strange questions which I answered very frankly but it worried me that this was the perception amongst young women who were looking for work in the IT sector. She said that she had heard that IT companies did not want to hire women. I said that was not true and that in fact the percentage of women in the IT sector had trebled in the last few years according to research conducted by P@SHA.\n\nShe looked at me a little quizzically and then asked if it was true that companies didn\u2019t want to hire women wearing hijab or burqa. I told her to step out the door and look at the team outside. There were several women \u2013 all dressed differently \u2013 one in shalwar kameez, one in a hijab. I told her that some companies might prefer women who interacted with customers to be dressed a little more progressively but even that was not the norm. It was their brain power and expertise that companies were looking for. Since she was a programmer, I told her that her programming capabilities and her ability to work with the team and deliver on time and on budget was what was important to IT firms, not how she dressed.\n\nShe then asked, \u201cDo you think it is because I am slightly older and I started working after taking a little time off, that I am having trouble landing a job?\u201d I looked at her. She must have been in her late 20\u2019s or at the most in her early thirties. I smiled and told her that I didn\u2019t think she was over the hill \u2013 that there were many more years before she would be considered too old to be productive in an IT organization.\n\nShe then talked about the government and its lack of focus on providing a nurturing environment for young people and for their development. I let her talk and listened. It was really all I could do to help her. I promised I would check with the Oracle development houses and get back to her if there were any vacancies.\n\nShe left feeling better than when she had arrived, a little less burdened, a little more hopeful that life was not all doom and gloom for women in the workforce. How many more young people are out there who just need to talk to someone, who just need an outlet, who need some advice and guidance. What can we do to help them, to give them a fair hearing if nothing else?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "A surprise visitor"},

When the clock ticked 6:40 pm, I suddenly remembered that I had wanted to be at T2F to listen to Adil Najam of Pakistaniat speak at 7 pm. It was raining. The traffic was pretty bad. Should I or shouldn\u2019t I make a dash for it? I packed up my stuff, headed for the car but it wasn\u2019t until I actually had to make a decision to either turn right or left, that I took the right\u00a0 turn and headed for T2F.\n\nI was 10 minutes late (which isn\u2019t like me at all) but was told that he had just started. I caused a wee bit of a stir (much to my utter embarrassment) as I settled in to listen to the great man speak :). There were some familiar faces in the audience \u2013 Zak, Nuzhat, Jamash, Sabizak, Riaz, Mimi, Sabeen, Saira, some others \u2013 young and old. Surprisingly missing were people like Teeth Maestro, Inspirex and Rabia Garib (who says she forgot \u2013 IMAGINE THAT!)\n\nAs I listened to Adil Najam and watched him present animatedly, with total conviction, I was glad I had made the effort.\n\nDr. Adil Najam holds the Frederick S. Pardee Chair in Global Public Policy at Boston University. He also serves as the Director of the Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future and a Professor of International Relations and of Geography and Environment. He served as a Lead Author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); work for which the IPCC was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize along with Al Gore.\n\nProf. Najam has also taught at MIT, University of Massachusetts and at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts Univeristy. He has written over 100 scholarly papers, serves on the editorial boards of many scholarly journals and has several books to his credit including Pakistanis in America: Portrait of a Giving Community; Envisioning a Sustainable Development Agenda for Trade and Environment and Civic Entrepreneurship.\n\nHe is a past winner of MIT\u2019s Goodwin Medal for Effective Teaching, the Fletcher School Paddock Teaching Award, and the Stein Rokan Award of the International Political Science Association, the ARNOVA Emerging Scholar Award, and the Pakistan Television Medal for Outstanding Achievement. He is a frequent commentator on global policy issues in the international media and is the founder of the blog Pakistaniat.com.\n\nA lucid speaker, Dr. Najam spoke eloquently about his perception of what the world had become \u2013 a place where poverty prevailed, where violence had seeped into everyday language and behaviour, where the word democracy meant different things to different people both in the East and in the West.\n\nWhy, he asked, was it assumed that if a person was not educated, he was not capable of making a decision regarding whom he wanted to vote in as a leader and what exactly he expected the leader or the party in power to do for him? Another question he asked was: \u201cWas the world ready to accept the verdict of a democracy even if that verdict meant that a ruler they did not approve of, would come into power?\u00a0 Legitimate questions.\n\nHe also spoke about religion and how it had been used and abused by various groups to achieve their own objectives. It was those who were silent amongst us, who didn\u2019t get up and speak against fundamentalism perpetrated in the name of various religions, violence of all sorts initiated by different governments, who were equally to blame for the situation the world found itself in today, he said.\n\nThen of course he turned to Pakistan and its burgeoning democracy and he insisted that if we were to become a functioning democracy we needed to be patient and let the civilian government serve out their term (no matter how bad or ineffective we may think they were) so that they could be accountable for the positive or negative change they had brought about.\n\nOne of the things that I didn\u2019t quite agree with was his contention that we got the leaders we deserved and that part of the reason consecutive governments had been so corrupt and ineffective was because they knew that they had only a few months/years in power \u2013 and so they tried to make as much for themselves as possible. If they knew they had 5 years, would they be less likely to be corrupt? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nHe said Pakistanis are, on the one hand, in denial about what is wrong with this country and the things that need to be done to fix it. On the other hand, they tend to be too hard on themselves \u2013 for example he thinks we have a very vibrant civil society that has continued to evolve and it is something we should be proud of. There are decisions that we can influence by being vocal, by writing to our government and our parliaments, by using the new media to garner support \u2013 basically to have our voices heard.\n\nDr. Najam also spoke about how he started pakistaniat.com with 3 other individuals whom he has never met, and how it evolved from an online presence into area for discourse with an impressive number of visitors \u2013 pakistanis and non-pakistanis alike.\n\nThe Q&A was quite intense \u2013 all in all an interesting evening that raised a lot of questions and perhaps answered some.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Adil Najam at\u00a0T2F"},

Why? Because apparently although there is no entry fee, what they do ask is for you to hand over a copy of your ID card, Driving license or Passport.\n\nI really do not understand that at all. To ask for proof of your identity is one thing, but why should I be expected to hand over to the exhibition organisers a copy of my National ID card which contains my name, my residence address, my father\u2019s name, my date and place of birth and my photograph.\n\nThis is a privacy issue. Why do they need this information? What will they do with it? How many people in the organization will have access to it? What security measures will be taken to ensure that this they do not pass on a copy of it to someone else? What will be done to prevent someone from misusing this information?\n\nEntry to an exhibition is normally through an invitation, an entry ticket or paid registration or its free. No-one has ever asked for a copy of an ID card to be handed over. So why should Dawn? I object. And so should we all.\n\nWe have no privacy legislation in this country and so anyone who asks us for any kind of information \u2013 whether it be a government organization/department or a commercial one, we hand it over without a thought to what they will use this information for, how many people will have access to it and what they will do with it once they are done. The number of feedback forms we fill up on websites without checking out the Privacy Policy and without questioning the right of anyone to have access to our personal data, is totally unnerving.\n\nShouldn\u2019t we be thinking about this, debating it, making sure that policies are enacted that protect our individual privacy?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Should they have a right to ask for\u00a0this?"},

Not so. There were several dozen news sites that covered it with some degree of excitement and there were in depth reviews on Red Herring, Industry Standard and Venture Beat.\n\nThis site is different from Second Life and Google\u2019s My World in that it is targeted at 7-14 year olds. It also differs from other virtual kid sites because of the educational and cultural information it provides without taking away from the entertainment that the site is supposed to provide.\n\nI guess this has been in the making for a while and has been well thought out. I remember\u00a0 when I was last visiting Silicon Valley that Umair Khan, CEO of SecretBuilders Inc, first mentioned this venture over a cup of coffee. Umair was founder of Clickmarks which morphed into Folio 3. He is presently also CEO of Renaissance 2.0 Media and Venture Partner of The Entrepreneurs\u2019 Fund III.\u00a0 Innovation and startup culture seems to be in his blood very much a part of him.\n\nSecretBuilders is a virtual world that emphasizes on creativity and historical adventure. It exposes children to stories and concepts from the arts and humanities as they interact and play among fictional and historical characters including Shakespeare, Sherlock Holmes, Galileo and Socrates.\n\nThe press statement issued by the company on the occasion of the launch states that children\u2019s web sites such as Club Penguin and Webkinz offer pure entertainment but little nutritional value \u2013 like fudge \u2013 while educational sites try to sugar-coat skills-building programs but lack real appeal \u2013 like chocolate-covered broccoli.\n\nSecretBuilders has raised a total of $2.4 million to date from angel investors. The most recent funding closed after the financial crisis in October, providing a testament to the appeal of\u00a0its vision and early success with children and parents. Investors include Jeff Webber, former board member of Sybase and Commerce One, serial entrepreneurs Greg Titus and Carlos Cashman, whose company CourseAdvisor was acquired by The Washington Post Company in 2007, Ken Morse, the head of the MIT Entrepreneurship Center and Scott Hassan, co founder of eGroups and member of the Google founding team.\n\n\u201cSecretBuilders\u2019 investors, all of whom have children or grandchildren in the target age range, are dedicated to the mission of emphasizing arts and humanities in the lives of our kids\u201d, said Hassan, who also founded Willow\u00a0Garage in Menlo Park, Calif. He was attracted to the \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d aspect of SecretBuilders, Mr. Hassan added.\n\nGreat stuff Umair. Good luck with the venture.

By the time it was possible for me to leave him here in my brother\u2019s care, it was close to Eid and the ASOCIO General Assembly and ICT Summit which I was supposed to come back for in any case.\n\nSo while you guys were partying on Eid day I got up early, made some goodies for visitors who would be dropping in on my father during the day. Then I headed off for the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Center where the ASOCIO General Assembly was scheduled to begin at 10 am.\n\nASOCIO is an organization comprising of 20 member economies representing the ICT industries in Japan, Australia, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. It also has seven guest members from the USA, UK, Canada, Spain, France, Russia and Kenya.\n\nThe mission of ASOCIO is to act as a bridge for IT companies in the region to expand their network of contacts, do business together and develop their capabilities. Together these economies represent over 10,000 ICT companies in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nAfter a welcome address by the current president of ASOCIO \u2013 Ashank Desai of NASSCOM \u2013 we went straight into the agenda of the meeting which comprised reports and discussions as diverse as Public Policy, SME Development, Relationship with global organisations and the ASOCIO Ambassador Program.\n\nAs has become customary at these events, there was a lot of debate on several of the subjects and sharing of programs that had worked or failed in different economies.\n\nThe tea and coffee that flowed throughout the morning session kept people alert and active. Wifi was available so whenever a discussion went off on a tangent, some of us caught up with email. Generally though, Lucas Lim the Secretary General and Ashank kept people on track.\n\nEach of the ASOCIO officers had brought little souvenirs for everyone \u2013 I didn\u2019t go home to Karachi as I had intended to so I was deprived of the pleasure of giving anyone anything this year :( Oh well, I guess I will just have to make up for it at the Plenary Meeting. I did give Lucas the \u201cInspiring Innovation\u201d P@SHA t-shirt and a copy of the P@SHA study for the ASOCIO Secretariat. No no, he will wear the shirt, not file it away in the secretariat. :)\n\nNext on the agenda was lunch \u2013 and what a lunch it was! The menu included Deep fried Prawn with Mashed Taro and Almond, Double boiled Sea Conch and Honey Dew Melon, Baked King Scallop with Cheese and Butter, Braised Fillet of Garoupa, Baked Chicken with Crispy Rice in Spicy Salt, Braised e-Fu Noodles with Enoki and Conpoy, Double Boiled Fresh Milk and Egg White and Chinese Petits Fours. One couldn\u2019t really have all that was served but I did gobble down my favourites \u2013 especially the Prawns, the Scallop and the Groupa and Noodles \u2013 and the Chinese dessert which is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, was absolutely yummy.\n\nSome of us took the opportunity of networking and taking snapshots during the different courses.\n\nThe view from the lunch room was beautiful. I couldn\u2019t capture it all but that didn\u2019t discourage me from taking the odd photo or two.\n\nJust when we had begun to have some fun, we were ushered back into the General Assembly by a young lady with a xylophone.\n\nThe afternoon session comprised of discussions focusing on Skills Development, Standars and Training, PR and Branding, Financial Health of ASOCIO and the presentation of the financial report for 2008 and the budget for 2009 by the Secretary General.\n\nDiscussions ensued and some sub-committees were formed to come up with suggestions and a plan of action. I am on the PR & Branding sub-committee as well as the Sub-Comittee that is going to work closely with KPMG Australia on a study and strategy for ASOCIO countries going forward \u2013 a sort of Vision 2020.\n\nDavid Chang, the ED for Taiwan then made a bid to host the 2010 ASOCIO General Assembly. I will not share with you some of the temptations he offered in his presentation to delegates (don\u2019t want to corrupt the minds of my younger readers). David is an entertainer to say the least and so the presentation was balanced with humour and fact. The General Assembly voted to hold the 28th GA in Taipei. To celebrate their win, which they had no doubt expected, the Taiwan delegation distributed Lindt chocolate boxes to all the ASOCIO officers. They even opened up a couple of boxes so we could sample the wares. Yummmmmmm!\n\nElections for Officers was held and it was decided that the GA to grant Ashank Desai a year\u2019s extenstion. The VPs would continue their term as well until the next GA in Melbourne in 2009.\n\nOther Agenda items were covered quickly and then the Australian team gave a presentation of the plans they had for the joint ASOCIO and APICTA event in Melbourne in 2009. Some suggestions were made on tweaking the dates and some of the overlaps. AIIA is trying to blend in a lot of networking and business exchange and promotion activities during the 4-5 days that people will spend in Melbourne at the two events. It actually looked great and as soon as the dates are fixed, each of the countries will look at how to maximise participation from their membership.\n\nIf you think this brought the day to a close, no such luck. The Hong Kong Trade Development Council was waiting to host a Welcome Reception in the Bauhinia Room so we made our way through the HKCEC complex to join them. More hob-nobbing, and sampling of food and drink continued until Stephen Lau, Chairman of APICTA, took some of us aside for a mini conference regarding APICTA issues.\n\nBy the time I got home, I was ready to flop into bed. It had been a long day. Constructive but tiring nonetheless. So that is how I spent Eid day. Talk about commitment to the cause \u2013 ok ok so it was fun too! :)\n\n", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "I spent Eid-ul-Azha at the ASOCIO General\u00a0Assembly"},

We gathered at the Rennaissance Harbour View Hotel on the Wanchai waterfront and walked to the restaurant. For some who were not expecting it to be cold in Hong Kong, it was a chilling experience. The dinner was organized by our hosts, the ISIA (Information and Software Industry Association) Hong Kong. And true to Hong Kong tradition, the focus was on food.\n\nISIA had booked the entire restaurant for the ASOCIO gathering. At first they gave us a menu and asked that we order whatever we liked and then they said \u201cOh what the hell \u2026 let us just try everything!\u201d Seriously, they ordered everything on the menu so that we could sample anything we wanted. And the quantity was humungous!.\n\nI was ensconed in one corner with an interesting group of people \u2013 Kelly Hutchinson (GM of the Australian Information Industry Association), Lucas Lim (the Secretary General of ASOCIO), Akansha Tete from NASSCOM and Chong from the ISIA.\n\nThe meal began with a platter full of the most delicious in seafood delicacies on ice \u2013 prawns, crab, mussels, oyster, etc. Accompanying this was garlic bread of a kind we had never tried before \u2013 absolutely mouth watering. Naturally we OD\u2019d on all this as we chatted and exchanged stories and experiences.\n\nThis was followed by a lobster bisque which was heavenly. Some of us asked for a second helping\u00a0 \u2026 yes, I must admit that I was convinced to have a second helping while others sipped on vodka and red wine :).\n\nBy the time we had finished the soup, we were already full. But the meal was nowhere near over. There were more mussels, steak, lampchops, a dish of assorted vegetables. some goose thingy and god knows what else. I had the mussels but was not up to having anything else.\n\nThen came the desserts \u2013 several of them. The hot baked chocolate with ice-cream was worth killing for. Of course we sampled each one of the desserts just so we would not live to regret it the next day. :)\n\nI am sure I have not menationed some of the courses \u2013 someone counted 22. Anyway, it was certainly a warm and befitting welcome to the city of Hong Kong. Thanks ISIA. By the way, someone told the organizers I spoke Cantonese (I suspect it was Lucas) so I had to converse with them in the local lingo for part of the time. Strange how it all comes back once you are in the right environment.\n\nWe then walked back to the Rennaissance Hotel where we stood around chatting until everyone decided that we should call it a night and catch a few hours of sleep prior to the General Assembly the following day. I headed home to my brother\u2019s flat but I have a sneaking suspicion that some of the guys sneaked off for a night on the town.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "ASOCIO event in Hong Kong starts with a\u00a0party"},

Somehow I think it\u2019s a conspiracy that all these cool things are happening during my absence from Pakistan :).\n\nAnyhow, I thought I would participate the best way I could \u2013 even though I am in Hong Kong \u2013 and a number of young people made it so much easier for me to do that. I logged into:\n\nSaad Hamid\u2018s live video stream from the event.\n\n Fariha Akhtar\u2018s live blogging from the venue.\n\n Imran Hussain twittering.\n\nIt was the next best thing to being there. I watched and listened as Awab and Sabeen talked about why and how they set up their blogs and answered loads of questions related to ethics, political activism and how to get past the language problem by using audio and podcasts. Someone (I don\u2019t know who) mentioned a Nastaliq font that was available for blog. That will be interesting for a lot of people who have been wanting to write but have let the necessity of having to use English stop them.\n\nThen Badar Khushnood did his thing \u2013 spoke about the blogosphere, talked about how the population of bloggers was growing and how people were finding ways to generate revenue through their blogs. He gave examples of a housewife from Lahore who has set up http://www.pinkwool.com and of course Haris Nadeem (18 years old) and Saad Hamid (20 years old) who generate traffic totaling 10,000 and 25,000 unique visitors a day.\n\nHaris and Saad were up next. They talked about how they had started blogging and what it had taken to achieve the level of success that they have. It came down to a few key things \u2013 interest/passion, research, good content and consistent blogging. Good going kids! We can all learn a thing or two from you. More about these guys on the CIO site.\n\nI had lost the video stream a little earlier (but not before I spotted Rabia moving people from side of the room to the other and giving away a goody bag or two) and continued following the twittering and the liveblogging so ably done by Imran and Fariha.\n\nThere followed a panel discussion and a lot of sharing of information. I think that was possibly the best part of the entire event \u2013 the fact that people got together to network, to get to know each other, to share information, celebrate each other\u2019s success and show newere bloggers the way. Way to go Badar, Rabia and Salaina for putting this together.

His clinic is in Central Building which is a posh office building in Hong Kong\u2019s financial district. As we entered and sat down on the leather sofas with silk cushions, I noticed the crystal horses and vases that were part of the exquisite decor. The receptionists and medical assistants were dressed in classy pink trouser suits and had pink sweaters on. Each of them had a headset which they used to communicate with each other and with the team in various offices.\n\nThere was a large plasma television playing a James Bond flick. The nurse rolled in the latest techological equipment which took my father\u2019s BP, pulse, oxygen saturation and temperature as we sat and waited. I looked around at the many certificates from Cambridge and elsewhere and slowly it dawned on me why his consultation fee was so high. We certainly were out of place in a place like this which was obviously for the elite.\n\nA few minutes later the receptionist asked us to take my father downstairs to the 7th floor to the Bio Imaging centre which I have a sneaking suspicion is also owned by him. The same uniforms, the same slick environment and when we asked to borrow a wheelchair, they had no qualms about loaning it to us.\n\nBack in the doctor\u2019s office on the 12th floor I was impressed to see that he had all my father\u2019s data up on his 21\u2033 desktop computer. As he put up the xrays and scans, he took pictures with his camera and added them to the records, turning around and telling me that he would send me the images as well so that I could readily refer to them if I wished.\n\nImpressed as I was with the efficiency of the operation, and grateful that we could afford to provide my father with the best in healthcare (thanks mostly to my brother who keeps saying \u201cmoney can be earned \u2013 he deserves the best\u201d), once again I was reminded of what my mother used to say to me through the years that she was ill. She said \u201cWe are fortunate to be able to benefit from the best healthcare. But what are people who can\u2019t afford all this supposed to do when they fall ill?\u201d It is for this reason that in memory of her, we contribute as much as we possibly can towards the medical care of those who can\u2019t afford it.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/a-noble-profession-but-not-for-everyone/", "text": "When Ammi developed a bed sore so deep that it took a year, and a change of dressing twice a day, to heal, I questioned the nursing care she had been given at one of the best hospitals in Pakistan. Throughout her prolonged illness I watched with concern (and had numerous confrontations with the medical staff) as, off and on, I came across nurses in several parts of the world who seemed to lack the spirit and essence of the nursing profession.\n\nWith my father\u2019s recent attack of pneumonia and hospitalization I have come face-to-face with nursing care in public and private hospitals in Hong Kong. There is only one clear conclusion that I can come to. If a person is not temperamentally cut out to be a nurse, then they should spare the sick people whom they will come into contact with during their nursing careers.\n\nNursing is not just a job \u2013 actually no profession is just a job \u2013 but nursing is a calling. Caring for sick people is a great responsibility. If you do not have compassion and respect for those in your care, you should pack up your bags and turn in your nursing license. We all know that a person who is ill is really vulnerable. He is totally at the mercy of those who are tending to him. Connected to all sorts of tubes \u2013 providing saline, antibiotics, oxygen and what have you \u2013 they are probably in a lot of pain or, at the very least, a great deal of discomfort. They are unsure of when or if they will get well. They have lost all control of their bodies and their lives. A nurse should not take away the one thing they have left \u2013 their dignity. Be gentle with them. Be understanding. Make it easier on them rather than more difficult.\n\nI have a great deal of respect for nurses. I know it is not an easy profession. I think it takes really special qualities to be a good nurse. The legendary \u2018Florence Nightingale\u2019, has I am sure, been an inspiration for every nurse. I have come across nurses who treat their patients with the utmost care \u2013 who talk even to infants or those in a coma because they do not want to dehumanize them. My mother often talked about a nurse who was a friend of my grandmother\u2019s who was extremely selfless. My mother called her an angel who brought joy and comfort to so many who were in her care.\n\nThat is why when I come across nurses who are gruff, rough and dismissive of patients, with not a drop of human kindness in them, I totally lose it! Why the hell would they take up nursing as a profession if, to them, patients are merely a nuisance and their near and dear ones are a source of annoyance wanting constant updates on the patient\u2019s condition?\n\nThese questions often plague me and they came to me yet again when my father was admitted to one of the most beautiful, clean, well-equipped and well-run public hospitals in Hong Kong. It even had a lovely Starbucks outlet on the ground floor with free wifi where I spent many hours when I was thrown out of the ward.\n\nThe only thing lacking at this hospital was the attitude of some of the nurses who treated patients with so little respect and compassion, that my father was heard to say to one of them \u201cI am sick \u2013 please be gentle\u201d. My brother and I just couldn\u2019t bear to hear this and so we shifted him to the Hong Kong Adventist Hospital which is a private hospital. I was able to stay with him and keep an eye on the care he was being given.\n\nEveryone thought we were a bit mad because, as permanent residents of Hong Kong, at the Queen Mary Hospital we would only have to pay 1/36th of the total billed amount.\n\nAt the Hong Kong Adventist Hospital, we have to pay for the private room, the tests, the two doctors and everything else. But the decision was made \u2013 cost was not a consideration for us \u2013 he is our father, he has given us so much, he is responsible for who we are and he deserves to be provided with the best in healthcare that we can afford.\n\nAt the Hong Kong Adventist we have found all the nurses attending to my father to be gentle, sweet,\u00a0 encouraging and professional. They care for the patients, talk to them, cajole them, joke with them. The cynics might say that these nurses are paid to be nice. That is not really the point. It really has to do with what your calling is. There were nurses at the Queen Mary Hospital who were equally gentle and compassionate. What put us off was that there were some who were very rough and it worried us to leave him in their care.\n\nMy father was totally immobilized when he was admitted into the Adventist. He was on oxygen and was taken there in an ambulance. On the last day the doctor and nurses made sure that he was sitting down and was taking a few steps so that as he recovered at home, he would be able to manage with a little assistane from us.\n\nThey told us that unless he started moving around a bit with some help, he would be completely bedridden for a long long time. He needed to be encouraged to eat and drink and move his limbs as this would aid his complete recovery.\n\nThank God he is finally home at my brother\u2019s house in Hong Kong. It will take weeks before he can cope on his own but the care that he received in hospital has got him well on his way. Of course it helps that he has my brother and me with him as well as a young Indonesian domestic helper who is an absolute angel at helping to take care of him. She is a Muslim girl who says that as she was growing up she was taught that it was a blessing to be able to care for older people. Hmmm \u2026 ?

It is one of the most difficult things that anyone in management ever has to do. However, as Guy Kawasaki points out, it is hardest on the person being laid off and he/she is not really concerned about how badly it makes you feel as a manager.\n\nWith the downturn in the global economy, each time you pick up the newspaper or turn on the radio or television, all you hear is how many people are being laid off \u2013 Citibank laying off 52,000 people, HSBC laying off between 450 \u2013 600 people, DBS Singapore laying off thousands, other banks, financial institutions, automobile companies and multinational companies are not far behind. Then there is news of Intel and Dell showing a drop in profits in the third quarter because of consumers unwilling to spend on technology. But on the other hand, in stark constrast Hewlett Packard has never looked healthier. Or is that just a mirage?\n\nHow will companies fare in Pakistan? Will there be layoffs? Will this affect every sector of the economy or only some select sectors? We are hoping that technology companies in Pakistan can take advantage of the economic downturn by offering more efficient and less expensive options in terms of solutions and services to local and overseas businesses. It is important to remember that although large and mid-sized companies will be looking to cut back on costs in order to survive, they still need work done and who would be better placed to bid for this work than the technology companies in Pakistan who are able to offer a better value proposition than larger outsourcing firms in other parts of the world. That may be the reason why some technology companies here are still hiring \u2013 although no doubt they admit that it is selective hiring.\n\nGuy Kawasaki post on the art of laying off people caught my eye and I thought I would share it with those who haven\u2019t come across it.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Is there a right way to lay off\u00a0people?"},

I had thought I would stop over for a few days on my return from Jakarta to Karachi, rediscover old haunts, watch a movie or two, have a few yummy meals and just chill. It has been a very hectic and stressful year and I needed to recharge :)\n\nI also thought that my father would benefit from the change. He has old friends here and Hong Kong holds a lot of memories for us all. But unfortunately the best laid plans of mice and men (and women) can be totally upset by unexpected occurences.\n\nIn this case my father developed some sort of lung infection and was hospitalized so I cut short my visit to Jakarta and returned to Hong Kong a day early to be with him and care for him. It is not easy to see someone you care about in pain and discomfort. My brother and I are trying to do whatever we can to provide support and ensure that he recovers as soon as possible.\n\nI spend most of my time in the hospital \u2013 by his side or in Starbucks \u2013 yes strange as it may seem there is a Starbucks in the Main Lobby of the hospital. When the nurses throw me out for a few hours, I walk the streets or take a ferry ride and then head back to the hospital. The weather is pleasant here these days (15 \u2013 21 degrees Centigrade). I enjoy the walk\u00a0 because it revitalizes me and the ride on the ferry clears away the cobwebs.\n\nThe blue-green water of Victoria Harbour, that Imran Zia looked anxiously for in Jakarta, is soothing to look at. Christmas decorations are up making the atmosphere a little more festive despite the severe economic downturn news of which surrounds all of us wherever we go. Strategies for contending with it are different depending on whom you talk to.\n\nA very different kind of Christmas tree/mall directory. I thought it looked quite cool. Not quite my type of christmas deco but everyone was taking a picture with this as a backdrop so I thought I would also take a snapshot of it.

For one thing we all became millionairres overnight as we exchanged dollars for Indonesian currency. The rate fluctuates from Rs. 10,500 to the dollar to around Rs. 12,000 to the dollar. I never thought I would spend hundreds of thousands on a meal, a journey from the airport to the hotel or for anything really.\n\nWhat we have all been trying to rationalize is how Jakarta has managed to clean up their act \u2013 great infrastructure, good roads, buses in bus-only lanes, motorbikes in separate lanes, no encroachments, no obvious pollution, no graffiti. How did they do this? Jakarta, like Karachi, is heavily populated too. Some years ago Jakarta was very very different. Perhaps a case study of it might help us understand the phenomenon, and learn from it. Couldn\u2019t really be rocket science.\n\nAt the APICTA gala dinner on the night of the 15th we realized how committed the Indonesian government is to developing their IT sector. The Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia was himself present at the Awards night and shook hands with the winners in all 16 categories. Also present was the Minister for IT and the Director General, in addition to the head of Aspiluki, the industry association.\n\nIn his speech the VP invited people from the region to come and invest in the Indonesian IT sector and also spoke about the opportunities available to companies who had expertise in various segements of IT strategy, development and deployment. He said the Indonesian government recognized that it was development and support of the IT sector that would spur the Indonesian economy.\n\nHe showed his sense of humour when he commented on APICTA Chairman Stephan Lau\u2019s comment regarding the Jakarta traffic jams, by saying that he hoped that the traffic jams would continue because they showed that the Indonesian economy was thriving. He remembered the Asian Economic Tsunami when the roads were devoid of cars and traffic jams were just a memory.\n\nHe also said that Indonesia was also trying to promote copyright protection in a country where copyright, to most people, means \u2018a right to copy\u2019.

As you can see from the smiles, we bagged a few awards.\n\nPixSense PSP won the award for Best in Media and Entertainment Applications. Adnan was apparently not expecting it because he didn\u2019t have a bag large enough to take it home.\n\nTPS Pvt Limited\u2019s IRIS won the Award for Best in Tools & Infrastructure Applications. It\u2019s impressive diverse application wowed the judges and Shahzad Shahid was there to claim the trophy.\n\nIf the Kraysis team of Jamil, Khurram and Mustafa looks shell-shocked, it is because they were probably not expecting to win. They knew there was competition and had worked 25 hours at a stretch to revamp their presentation, put in all the missing meat and remove all the fat. They were chosen as the Best in the Startup Category.\n\nImran Zia and I just had to have a picture taken with the winners. We missed our remaining judges \u2013 Jawwad Farid was there to see PixSense, TPS and Kraysis receive their awards but had to leave right afterwards for the airport. Sultan Hamdani and Nadeem Aslam Malik were already on the way home.\n\nAll in all, there were 134 applications in the running for awards at APICTA 2008 in Jakarta \u2013 from 11 economies in 16 categories. Only 16 trophies were awarded and we bagged 3 of them. Yay!!! But as Stephen Lau, Chairman of APICTA rightly said \u2013 anyone who participated in these awards was a winner and should be proud of his or her achievements. P@SHA had 12 submissions at APICTA this year of which 4 of the nominees in the areas of e-Health and e-Learning were not able to participate. Hence there were only 8 applications that were actually in the running. All of them put up very strong submissions. The ones who did not qualify for the trophy were told later by the judges in their categories that they had missed by as little as 0.2 points and .17 points.\n\nMore later! Just wanted to break the news. Well done Team P@SHA ICT Pakistan. It was an evening which gladdened our hearts. We are so proud of all of you.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/11/15/1599/", "text": "This is the schedule for the APICTA event in Jakarta. Quite a full and busy schedule especially for the judges who are flown in by the host country. They have to follow a strict code of ethics and work long hours \u2013 from 8:30 am \u2013 6:30 pm after which the data is input into the judging system. They then have to check the entry to see that it is accurate and then sign off on it.\n\nThis is usually followed by Networking events \u2013 this year there was the Hong Kong reception and the Malaysian reception in addition to an RFID sharing session that was set up by Hong Kong.\n\nAdnan Agboatwalla is at APICTA for the 3rd time. Last time PixSense PSP won the Merit in the Communications category (there was no winner). This year the product has undergone a major change with at least a dozen more new features, several new customers like China Mobile, Vodafone Europe and the Philippine telco. He was seen to be fine tuning his presentation, getting his props together and putting everything in the cache in case the wifi service went crazy. He said as he came out that his presentation went perfectly \u2013 but Adnan the question is, what did the judges think? When asked, Adnan said they were thrilled with the Geo-tagging feature. He is eyeing the Winners trophy in the Media & Entertainment Category this year. Will he get it?\n\nZubair and Sharjeel impressed us all with their zeal and their dedication and the support they gave each other. They took advice, worked hard on their presentations and rehearsed them endlessly so as to put on a good show. Zubair is from FAST NUCES Islamabad. He has come up with an application that detects malware that is a non-executable file \u2013 could be a pdf, a jpeg, an excel sheet, a word doc or an mp3. Sharjeel is the CEO of SeenReport \u2013 a citizen journalism service that has been used by many to upload news and, as he says, \u201cenact change.\u201d His product was pitched in the e-Community and e-Inclusion category which is a new category. They are both \u201cwinners\u201d in my book but how did they do in comparison to the other entries in their categories? We will know tonight.\n\nAre Shahzad Shahid of TPS and Khurram of Kraysis comparing notes on strategy or are they giving each other feedback on how their presentations went.\n\nYou know whether they get the APICTA trophy or not, both Shahzad and the Kraysis team (Jamil, Khurram and Mustafa) went through the wringer to get their presentations just right. They re-created them and rehearsed them until they were happy that they got them just right. They learnt how one shoe doesn\u2019t fit all \u2013 and that they should have different kinds of presentations for different audiences. Good luck guys!\n\nOmar and Faraz Sherwani blew us all away with their delivery styles and the confidence they exuded. They were in Jakarta to pitch products in two categories for brother Jahanzeb who is completing his PhD at Carnegie Melon \u2013 Jaadu VNC in the Communications Category and HealthLine in the R&D category. They put on a good show, answered questions with great confidence. Father Khalid Sherwani \u2013 a retired banker, a former President of UBL \u2013 was with them. They left last night and have requested that I collect the trophy on their behalf if they win. It will be an honour guys! Well done! You have a great future ahead of you. We look forward to seeing more of you.\n\nHave you ever seen anyone as excited as Anjum Farooq Chohan of Palmchip? He said the judges thought that GeoTel was a really amazing R&D project. For those who don\u2019t know what it is, what GeoTel does is, it identifies and pinpoints any breakage in the fibre laid by telcos thus saving downtime and a great deal of lost revenue. This is the first year that we have participated in the R&D category, and we are really excited at the new trend in the Pakistan ICT sector to concentrate on R&D in cutting edge areas. Palmchip has a great product \u2013 we will know this evening if it won at APICTA against others in this category. Good luck Anjum.\n\nWe took this in the Jakarta Convention Centre yesterday \u2013 it was quite impromptu so there are a few people missing from our delegation. Yes that is Jawwad Farid in his shariah-compliant shorts (no he did not wear this for the judging \u2013 he actually wore a suit on both days). And next to him is Sultan Hamdani in his Shariah-compliant shalwar kurta. Sultan actually made the immigration officer smile when he responded to a question regarding where he was staying, by saying \u201cmy hotel\u201d \u2013 the Sultan Hotel is what he meant. :)\n\nIt is D-Day today and we will have the judges\u2019 verdict at the APICTA dinner tonight. However, as I have said in an earlier post, our team are all winners and we are very proud of their performance at APICTA 2008.

After the long day I had on the 12th, you would have thought that I would have crashed, as would have the judges and nominees who had just flown in from Karachi and Lahore tired, deprived of sleep and needing so desperately to rest.\n\nBut did any of us rest? No way. We are in Jakarta on a mission. To show our award-winning products (they are all award-winning having won the P@SHA ICT Award in Pakistan a few weeks ago)! We had decided that we were going to put on the best performance we could.\n\nAnd that is just what we did. After a 15 minute break we all met in the meeting room at the Sultan Hotel for initial mock presentations. And we tore them to shreds. We had asked them beforehand if we could be brutal with our comments. All the nominees said we could, so there were no holds barred.\n\nMost of the presentations we make as IT companies are sales presentations \u2013 and as such they are probably brilliant. But for APICTA, they are absolute no-nos.\n\nAs technologists and researchers, we are prone to putting all the technical jargon into any presentation we make. We want to show in 20 minutes the years of work that we have put into developing our products and our companies. But is that all really relevant when you are presenting to a panel of judges who are looking at a clearly defined judging criteria? Nope. And that is exactly what we had to drum into our brilliant, innovative and talented group of nominees from Pakistan. There was no mincing of words. Each of us took the presentations apart, gave detailed advice on what should remain and what shouldn\u2019t, on what the approach should be if they were going to grab the judges\u2019 attention in the first 5 minutes. The meat, the gist had to be right up front \u2013 what was unique about the product, what was innovative, current market size, what was the market potential, what recognition and quality standards had they followed, what technologies had been used, what was their revenue and their future course of action? This had to come out clearly in the first 5 minutes. And for community products/services, what impact had it made on the community?\n\nOf course it took a lot out of the coaches \u2013 this picture of P@SHA Chairman Imran Zia is an indication of the state we were in by the time we finished the seesion late at night and finally headed to the restaurant for dinner.\n\nThis exercise was repeated on the second night. Each candidate was asked to present, was given advice, was told to fix various parts of his presentation and delivery, and was tested a second time.\n\nWhat is important to relate here is that the training, coaching and support that was given to kids like Zubair Shafiq of FAST NUCES (he was presenting on Day 1), Islamabad by seasoned judges like Sultan Hamdani the first day was in turn given by Zubair to Sharjeel of See\u2019n\u2019Report with the same commitment (Sharjeel was slotted in to present on Day 2).\n\nAs Sharjeel pointed out after he had made his presentation, \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to win \u2026 I came here to experience what it was like to present to an international panel, to share our vision for the company and our product and to learn from what others are doing.\u201d Great attitude young man! Isn\u2019t that the attitude that makes us feel proud of all the delegates we have brought to this event year after year? Good luck Team Pakistan. The Awards night is tonight. You have already been recognized as winners \u2013 being nominated for APICTA is recognition in itself.

Hey guys we have been busy you know. We leave the hotel room at 7:15 a.m. for breakfast, work and network through the day, and don\u2019t get done with dinner and coaching and rehearsing until very late. By this time we are all dead on our feet. Can\u2019t even think about\u00a0 putting up a photo, let alone a post. However, it is a legitimate gripe by those cheering us on, so here goes.\n\nI arrived in Jakarta on the night of November 11 from Hong Kong. It was a non-eventful flight \u2013 read a bit, watched \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d and dozed a little. Immigration in Jakarta took all of 30 seconds which was really a pleasant surprise after the hassle we had gone through in getting the visa. The baggage, however, was another story. Priority baggage took 25 minutes to arrive. Fortunately someone from the APICTA Secretariat was there to pick me up and whizz me off in a high-roof. It was dark already so I didn\u2019t see much. The first impact was that the roads were wide and clean, there were no encroachments, no potholes, the traffic was smooth that night although generally traffic jams are the norm. I am visiting Jakarta after a long break so I really was surprised at how clean and developed it was \u2013 the flyovers, the toll gates, the skyscrapers. It was certainly not the Jakarta I remembered. I was very impressed.\n\nPeople here are normally quite laid back and so it took them about an hour to check me into the Sultan Hotel where most of us are staying.The hotel is connected to the Jakarta Convention Centre where the APICTA event is taking place. It was midnight by the time I checked in. By the time I settled in, it was almost 2 am.\n\nAt 6 I got up, showered, changed, unpacked, had a quick bite to eat and then headed for the APICTA Exco meeting at 8:30 a.m. This was followed by the Judges\u2019 briefing which was attended by Sultan Hamdani and myself. The other judges \u2013 Imran Zia, Nadeem Aslam Malik and Jawwad A. Farid had still not arrived so we had to pitch in for them at the briefing, and pick up their Judges\u2019 folders. Nadeem and Imran were also made Head judges in different categories.\n\nThis was followed by the Opening Ceremony which started with a loud bang \u2013 no not fireworks, just the beating of a gong by a government dignitary from the Ministry of Information Technology, Government of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nThis was followed by the sound of some drums which seemed to emanate from these very malnourished drummers :)\n\nWe had a quick lunch which was very welcome indeed as I was starving by this time. The food was local and was extremely good.\n\nThen followed the Economy Coordinators\u2019 meeting \u2013 which was the third hat I was wearing. I went in for that briefing and was given the delegate bags for all our nominees, judges and Exco members.\n\nThe schedule and layout of the APICTA judging was discussed and we were given instructions on when and how to bring in nominees. They were to register half an hour prior to their judging slot during which time they could wait in the Waiting Area and check out their laptop connections with the Plasma screen which was a replica of the one in the judging rooms.\n\nUshers would then park the nominee outside the judging room 5 minutes prior to their presentation time.\n\nWe were taken for a round of the venue prior to being dismissed for the day. Actually we were given about half an hour to change and then head for the FX Tower which is supposedly \u201chappening\u201d place in town. The Welcome Reception was to take place there.\n\nWe had already decided that we would not be attending the reception because we had to work with our companies and ensure that they were on the right track vis-a-vis their product presentations.

All those of you who are in Lahore or can be in Lahore on November 13, don\u2019t miss the opportunity to attend this event.\n\nFor more information and to register online, please visit http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=57687680808 or http://tinyurl.com/wud-lhr-pk (limited seats available).\n\nFor those who cannot be in Lahore on Nov 13, the organisers are trying to web-cast the event live @ http://www.ustream.tv/channel/world-usability-day", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "World Usability Day event at UMT,\u00a0Lahore"},

What happened, you might ask, to cause such extreme reactions?\n\nWell, I had applied for an Indonesian visa \u2013 the process and the experience is yet another story that I will relate at some other time. The climax of the entire experience took place yesterday when I sent my office assistant to pick up my passport from the consulate. I am to travel tonight so it was essential that I had my visa yesterday.\n\nWhen he got there at 2:30 pm he was told that he couldn\u2019t have the passport although the visa was ready for collection. The reason, the lady told me over the phone, was that before she gave me my visa, I needed to provide her with a letter from my family giving me permission to travel to Indonesia alone. I was speechless for a few seconds and then I said \u201cWHAT?\u201d She explained that since I was single, I needed my father or mother\u2019s permission to travel.\n\nI was so irritated that I told her that it might be a wee bit difficult to get my mother to write a letter since she had passed away 5 years ago. Then your father will have to write it, she said. I asked if she knew how old I was. She said it didn\u2019t matter if I was 80. If I was single and a woman, I still needed permission from my family.\n\nExasperated though I was, I had to remain cool and find a way out of this, so I explained to her that it would take me a couple of hours to get the letter from my father and by then the Consulate would be closed. I also asked why I hadn\u2019t been told of this \u201crequirement\u201d when I applied for the visa.\n\nShe must have realized the lapse on her part because she softened a bit (which for anyone who has met her, is a miraculous achievement) and said she would do me a special favour and hand my passport over to my office assistant IF i promised to send the letter to the consulate the next morning, together with a copy of my father\u2019s ID card. I naturally promised that I would. She then warned me that if I didn\u2019t, I would not be allowed to board the flight for Jakarta.\n\nI have sent the letter. My father was more than a little confused when I asked him to write it. It had been many years since I had asked for his permission to travel. I discuss my trips with him and inform him of my plans because he still worries about me but seeking his permission \u2013 especially in writing \u2013 is something I have not needed to do since I was in Junior school and had to get a letter for a school trip.\n\nSo all those single women who are planning to travel to Indonesia alone, please take heed! I swear if I hadn\u2019t committed to go with the delegation, I would have told the lady at the Consulate where to go.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Did you know?"},

Well written, well rehearsed, well presented. Compare that with Bush\u2019s speech and you can see why this relatively unknown young man has risen to the most powerful leadership position in the world today.\n\nListening to the speech, I wondered why our politicians do not bother to rehearse their acceptance speeches so that they can motivate the people of Pakistan, so that they can make an impression on the citizens of this country, and on the world. Good communication skills \u2013 and a lot of rehearsing can make a difference to how you are perceived, can lift a country out of its initial gloom and drive people to take action that is necessary to lift ourselves out of a bad situation.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Obama will be a good President. I don\u2019t know if his election will mean a positive change in the foreign policy of the US. I don\u2019t even know if he will be able to stand up to the challenges that face him, the US and the world as a whole. But one thing\u2019s for sure. His speech was the right first step and it has given a lot of Americans reason for hope. His mantra of \u201cYes we can\u201d has for the moment given people hope. The fact that an African-American has finally realised the dream of Martin Luther King has given African Americans a boost.\n\nI feel sorry that the US still doesn\u2019t seem ready for a woman President. Some say it was because Hilary was the candidate and she had too much baggage, and not enough of the ideals that Americans were looking for at this point of time. I think that, though that may be true, Americans would not have voted a woman into the Presidency no matter whom she was or how good she was. An African American man has managed to get there after more than a century of liberation from slavery but women still have a struggle ahead of them.

In fact Sarang and Talha have started motivating kids who had no idea that help was needed. The group is getting larger as we draw in people from various institutions. Imran was identified as the person who could obtain food at wholesales prices for distribution to victims of the earthquake.\n\nPixSense and Alchemy have offered to stock the goods in Karachi until we arrange for the shipments. The first shipment is due to leave on Saturday Nov 8.\n\nIn Lahore Chairman P@SHA Imran Zia (imran at vahzay dot com) has offered to coordinate efforts and set up a collection camp at Vahzay.

Then, much like the young men who wait on you in a coffee house (but with much more charm of course), he rattled off the options \u2013 espresso, latte, cappuccino, long black. And then of course there were different strengths of coffee available. He also had sugar cubes \u2013 white and brown both. And coffee beans of all sorts.\n\nI think I must have been slightly overwhelmed because I asked for a simple cup of black coffee and then when he wasn\u2019t looking, quietly took a couple of brown sugar cubes. I normally don\u2019t take sugar in my coffee but ever since I was a child, I have not been able to resist sugar cubes. Maybe it has something to do with being born in the Year of the Horse ;)\n\nAnyway, I had a wonderful cup of very strong coffee \u2013 I think it was Ecuadorian. Straightened me up completely. It\u2019s nice having a neighbour who has a terrific coffee machine \u2013 saves the drive to a coffee house, saves money (no he hasn\u2019t started charging for it yet!) and provides great company.

We have seen this clean Gola concept in various shopping malls in Pakistan but none of them thought to do it quite this way.\n\nI think what is truly impressive is the sheer attention to detail.

People look forward to it. It is the one opportunity that we have each year to formally recognize the innovation that exists in our industry, to get together with colleagues, customers and peers whom we may not have met for some time, to celebrate the growth that has taken place and re-iterate in our minds the things that we still need to do if we are to stay on track.\n\nThe hours before the event were nerve-wrecking and I thought there was no way we would be ready to welcome people at 8. But all that is forgotten now (or at least I am still trying hard not to remember what it was like) :) We were ready in time! And it was good to see that some people actually started to arrive at 8. They networked, met with old colleagues and friends. There was a sense of comraderie in the air. It was the kind of atmosphere that one just cannot create \u2013 it either happens or doesn\u2019t. Luckily for us it did. :)\n\nWe had expected a good turnout but certainly not as many as showed up \u2013 there were 380 people at the event in total. These included people from the IT and ITES sector in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. It included a significant number of bankers, representatives of some of the telcos and Heads of Computer Science from some of the local universities. We had also asked them to bring a half dozen students each with them. Then there was the media of course, some government officials and we shouldn\u2019t forget the Ambassadors from the Mohammad Ali Jinnah University, CBM and Szabist who were absolutely the bees knees. We couldn\u2019t have done it without them.\n\nThe evening began with a recitation from the Holy Quran by Salahuddin Ahmed of BearingPoint after which I thanked all the people who had helped to make the evening possible (I am sure I forgot to acknowledge some of them for which I hope I will be forgiven \u2013 maybe I can buy them lunch and thank them personally). Food always seems to work \u2013 reminds me of Hong Kong where everything centered around food.\n\nThere were a lot of people to thank:\n\nRodney Rahman, MD of BearingPoint, who so readily agreed to take on the Platinum Sponsorship for the event. BearingPoint was also the lead sponsor of the P@SHA Career Expos that we held in the 3 major cities earlier this year. Thanks Rodney.\n\nFurqan Qureshi, GM Strategy & Corporate Business of Wateen Telecom, who, when invited, actually wanted to know why we hadn\u2019t asked them to sponsor the event. Within minutes he and Athar Jamal, GM Marketing had come back to me with a commitment for the Gold Sponsorship. And when I suggested to Furqan that we wanted to organize live blogging from the event, he arranged for a 2 mb wimax connection which Fariha Akhtar (our main live blogger of the evening) tells me worked beautifully. Thanks Furqan \u2013 you may have ditched the IT sector and joined Telecom but with the convergence that\u2019s taking place, I guess there is no way you are going to disconnect yourself from our sector.\n\nThe National ICT R&D Fund must be congratulated too for taking on the Silver Sponsorship. Recognizing innovation and encouraging it is part of their mandate. Dr. Qasim was there personally to tell the audience about the Fund and its successes and to network with the many IT practitioners in the audience. Thank you Dr. Qasim.\n\nThanks to Samina Rizwan Oracle took on the Dinner Sponsorship and pulled in Dell (who sponsored a P@SHA event for the first time \u2013 the first of many we hope). The food was yummy (it had to be since Sadia and I had selected the menu). Dell also had a lucky draw and gave away an LCD which was won by a young man from Ensign Communique.\n\nBearingPoint gave the winner of the Student Tertiary Project,\u00a0 Zubair Shafiz of FAST-NUCES Islamabad, a Dell laptop in addition to the Award that he received for his iNIDS project. Way to go BearingPoint!\n\nKalsoft and PSEB were the Bronze sponsors of the event. The CIO team were there to provide media support. Of course what they didn\u2019t know was that they were in for a surprise. You should have seen the looks on their faces when I announced that the Award for Best in Media Support was being given to Rabia Garib and Salaina Haroon, the team behind CIO Pakistan, Net Xpress and Bits and Bytes. These young ladies have supported and showcased the Pakistan IT and ITES industry for years and it was about time someone recognized their contribution. :)\n\nAli Raza Shaikh and Ammar Yasir were responsible for the Awards logo, the Awards website and the t-shirt design and Sulaiman Farooqui of Centritech offered to have his call center agents handle all the RSVPs. Aamar Matin of Cisco Systems, Saba Kamal of IBM, Jawwad Farid of Alchemy Technologies and Imran Zia of Vahzay put in a lot of time to patiently judge all the entries and provide a fair assessment, so naturally they were thanked too.\n\nWith the thank you\u2019s behind us, it was time for the Chairman of P@SHA Imran Zia to give the State of the Industry report (reminded me of the State of the Union Address that the President of the US gives every now and then). Imran did a wonderful job of providing a realistic, practical and positive image of the industry, where it stood and where it was headed.\n\nThis was followed by a speech from Dr. Qasim Sheikh who talked about the objectives of the fund and how to access it.\n\nWith the speeches over, I sprung a surprise on my predecessor Ashraf Kapadia by inviting him onto the stage. Other than getting back at him, the reason for this was that last year the Awards event had not been held although the winners had been taken to Singapore for APICTA. This was therefore a great opportunity to present them with their Awards.\n\nThat done, it was finally time to end the suffering and begin announcing the names of the 2008 Award winners \u2013 with a drum roll of course ;)\n\nThe winner of the Communications Award was Jaadu VNC, the application developed by Jahanzeb Sherwani (a PhD student at Carnegie Melon) which is selling on the Apple iPhone App Store for US$25. Jahanzeb\u2019s mother Gaiti Ara, who is also the CEO of Jugaari Pvt Limited, accepted the Award on behalf of the company. The Merit in this category went to FoneiTall developed by Five Rivers Technologies.\n\nThe Converged Media Solutions application developed by PixSense won the Digital Media & Entertainment Award. This is an application that has found a market amongst telcos in Pakistan and internationally. Telenor, Vodaphone, China, Korea and Philippine mobile are amongst its prime customers.\n\nSince Adnan Agboatwalla is traveling as usual (in Paris these days) Sajjad Ropanis accepted the Award on behalf of the PixSense team. The Merit was picked up by Post Amazers for their product Commander Safeguard which they developed for P&G.\n\nIn the E-Community & E-Inclusion category, the Citizen Journalism website SeenReport won the top Award with Chopaal taking the Merit. No-one was surprised that both of these products came out of incubation from LUMS with the mentor being Dr. Umar Saif. Kraysis, a startup that focuses on QA, is yet another LUMS incubated company that now has a 25-30 stong team. Jamil Goher, Khurram Javed Mir were there with another member of their core team to accept the Award.\n\nTPS Pakistan picked up the Best in Financial Applications Award for IRIS whereas Abdul Rahman from Plexus bagged the Merit for their Investment Management Solution.\n\nThe e-Health Category was the most contested and the judges had a tough time picking a winner. Eventually they decided to award two merits in this category. The winner was CureMD for its EMR application. The merits were picked up by Adamsoft for DocComply and by Marriala Consultants for its e-Clinic application.\n\nUltraLearn, an mash-up application developed by Softech Worldwide using various cutting edge technologies including Microsoft\u2019s Silverlight, won the Best in E-Learning Applications Award.\n\nThe Research & Development Category is one that we have had difficulty attracting nominations for in previous years but this year there were a number of good projects that were nominated.\n\nThe winner was Palmchip\u2019s GeoTel Application that could prove very useful for telecom operators. It is being funded by the National ICT R&D Fund.\n\nJahanzeb Sherwani\u2019s HealthLine Application which he is working with NGO Helping Hands on, was the Runner up in this category.\n\nLumensoft Lahore won the E-Logistics Award for its Candela Retail Management application.\n\nThere were some Service Awards this year. The Best in Brand Development Award was a no-brainer. Kalsoft Pvt Ltd\u2019s newly revamped logo, its website and the creativity of its advertising in the Pakistan market as well as the Middle Eastern market, made it the natural winner of this category.\n\nThe winner of the Best in Call Center/BPO companies award was won by Ovex Technologies. The CEO Faisal Khan was there to accept the Award on behalf of his team. There was an Award for the Best in Innovative Work Environment. This was won by Nuvica \u2013 a young startup in Karachi. Nuvica is a company which has no member older than 25 years old. The entire team blog and, in addition to the work they do as part of the Nuvica team, they are encouraged to have their own individual projects. So while CEO Ali Raza Shaikh runs DevNext sessions at Universities, Ammar Yasir has set up Teabreak.pk and Fariha Akhtar runs IdeasHut.com. Fariha decided to blog the event live from the Marriott on the 31st of October while Awab Alvi a.k.a Teeth Maestro twittered the proceedings and Shrajeel and Adil Saleem used their mobiles to post the proceedings on SeenReport.\n\nThe Corporate Social Responsibility Award was given to Syed Azhar A. Rizvi for the Telemedicine efforts he made during to 2005 Earthquake, for his contribution in setting up the DAISY initiative in Pakistan, for his efforts in speading IT in Education to the rural and less developed areas of Pakistan and for bring Pediatric Heart Surgery to Pakistan.\n\nWhile all this was going on, Rabia Garib had set up Meet the Winners corner where winners, sponsors, visitors and judges were interviewed throughout the evening. CIO Pakistan had also set up a WebStudio where they intereviewed participants and uploaded photos, sound bytes and video clips onto their websites thanks to the WiMax facility provided by Wateen.\n\nAll in all it was a wonderful evening. No-one wanted to leave. I sat and chatted with the last few participants until around 1.30 am. Thanks to everyone for helping to make it an event to remember.\n\nThis post wouldn\u2019t be complete without a photo of the young people who helped to make everything work like clockwork that evening. Most of them have become regular volunteers for most P@SHA activities that are held in Karachi. Our sincerest thanks go out to them for cheerfully carrying out their work despite the extreme pressure. This photo was take after most people had left toward the wee hours so if we look washed out, there is a good reason. :)\n\nDisclaimer: The photos have been strewn around and do not necessarily link with the text.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The Pakistan IT industry celebrates\u00a0innovation"},

As most of you know we have the P@SHA ICT Awards 2008 \u2013 our flagship event \u2013 scheduled for tomorrow at the Karachi Marriott Hotel. This event celebrates the industry, recognizes innovation and is our major networking initiative, with the IT & ITES sector coming together with the corporate, government and academic sector. Arrangements are at a stage where commitments, expectations and activities cannot be put to a halt or reversed.\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem right however to proceed as if nothing had happened and to do nothing to assist those who are affected by the earthquake. I therefore had quick consultations with the Office bearers of P@SHA \u2013 Imran Zia, the Chairman and Sultan Hamdani, the Treasurer \u2013 and there was a consensus that we should go ahead and add an Earthquake Relief Drive to the event. Cheques and cash will be collected from companies and individuals at the event and the money will be used to purchase blankets, medicines and essential food items required by the victims.\n\nThe Relief process will be spearheaded by the P@SHA Secretariat who will form a committee of volunteers from the industry to assist us in ensuring that the IT & ITES industry provides whatever assistance is required.

Everything was viewed from a perspective of \u201chow will this affect me?\u201d So whether it was related to work, travel, entertainment, purchasing of goods, socializing etc, it was all seen from his own vision of what he considered to be of value, what he considered interesting and what made him happy.\n\nSo naturally when his child was born and he was told that the child had Down Syndrome, he looked up at the sky and said \u201cWhy me God? What have I done that you have given me such a child?\u201d For 3 days he didn\u2019t sleep \u2013 all he did was cry and feel sorry for himself. Then something happened. He doesn\u2019t know how or why these thoughts or feelings entered his mind but they did, almost like magic.\n\nHe looked at the child and felt a feeling of tenderness and protectiveness engulf him. He thought to himself \u2013 all my life I have never had to take care of another human being. This is the first opportunity I have been given to come out of my self-absorbed nature and do something for someone else \u2013 for this new life that has been gifted to me. I should consider myself very lucky (no, for those cynics out there, I am not making this up- it is absolutely true).\n\nFrom that day forward the child and he became inseparable. He did everything for him, shared every free moment with him, made sure that he got as much of his attention and his love as possible. He was surprised that doing this actually brought him a kind of joy he had never felt before. Selflessness did do something special for the soul.\n\nMany of us may have seen people with Down Syndrome. They have certain physical features, such as a flatter face,\u00a0 slanted eyes,\u00a0 a larger tongue. They could also have medical problems like heart defects. And they usually have some mental challenges, which means they may have trouble learning.\n\nRegardless of these challenges, kids with Down syndrome can go to regular schools, make friends, enjoy life, and get jobs when they\u2019re older \u2013 if proper care is provided.\n\nThis gentleman\u2019s child has bloomed because of the love and attention that has been showered on him. The concentration on teaching him reading, learning and comprehension skills is likely to result in articulation and speech fluency, visual and verbal short-term memory skills and the ability to use longer sentences than most other children with Down syndrome who are often neglected by their parents or seen as a punishment for unknown sins committed by them during their own lifetimes.\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful what the difference in the attitude of parents can make to the development of a child with any kind of challenges \u2013 in fact to the development of any child. Time and again we have seen this in children with autism and children with physical or visual challenges or a child who is especially gifted and does not fit into a mould that we call \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nSomething worth noting is that children with Down Syndrome have been known to take to computers with a passion.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/10/14/he-is-indeed-a-magical-young-man/", "text": "Listening to Jahanzeb Sherwani talk at T2F on Saturday made me smile indulgently (yes I am old enough to do that :)). There was a feeling of pride that filled the room. Here was a young man who was from amongst us, had graduated from LUMS with a BS in Computer Science and who is now a Final Year PhD Student at Carnegie Mellon University AND had developed an application that was selling on the Apple iPhone AppStore.\n\nHe stood there and spoke with a great deal of confidence to a small group of about 20 people who had come to listen to him out of curiosity and because they wanted to share in the thrill of his achievements and know more about his journey.\n\nIn the group were some young programmers, some slightly older techies, a CIO from a bank, a CTO from a Silicon Valley based company with a development office in Pakistan, as well as some non-techy Apple iPhone fanatics and bloggers.\n\nLike most geeks, Jahanzeb had started developing applications soon after completing his BS simply because it was something that interested him although there was one slight difference between him and many others, and that was that he identified a user requirement (or as Jawwad Farid is fond of saying, he identified a pain and found a cure for that pain).\n\nAs Jahanzeb took us through the history of Jaadu, the product that has brought him fame and hopefully fortune (although he wouldn\u2019t tell us how much \u2013 yes i did prod!), he told us how he developed the first version made a rough video-cut of what it could do, put it on YouTube, and was blown away by the amazing response \u2013 100,000 views the first week \u2013 it sort of reminded me of how Scrybe got started. JS\u2019s video was the #1 most viewed video on Sci/Tech that week.\n\nThe website made it to all the top tech blogs overnight \u2013 Digg, Engadget, Gizmodo, TUAW, etc.\n\nHaving always developed on Windows and for the Windows platform, why did he decide to develop an application for the iPhone? Simply because the iPhone is the first truly \u201cconverged\u201d device and it has what he terms a \u201crevolutionary\u201d interface. That\u2019s what attracted him to it.\n\nWas it difficult to get Jaadu onto the App Store? Apparently for him it really wasn\u2019t. Lucky break perhaps, the right app at the right time, an idea that appealed to iPhone users apparently since Jaadu received wide press coverage and was on the opening page of Apple iTunes in \u201cWhat\u2019s Hot\u201d and \u201cStaff Favourites\u201d internationally as soon as it was launched.\n\nLook at some of the Press Coverage it initially got (it was called Teleport at that stage):\n\nWashington Post: \u201c\u2026a winning application\u2026for those who need to really work with remote machines on their iPhone or iPod touch.\u201d\n\nToys and Gadgets: \u201c\u2026could be the best [iPhone pplication] that has been released so far\u201d\n\nThe Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW): First Look at Teleport\n\nSome of the lessons learnt that he passed on \u2013 especially to the other youngsters who were at T2F for his talk (those who weren\u2019t really missed out!)\n\n1. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you can\u2019t do something. I did it. Any of you can!\n\n2. Always concentrate on the Interface Design and on the user. Get a non-techie to test it. Make sure you are building the app for the users and not for yourself. The coding is the simplest part of the exercise.\n\n3. Develop it, check it for bugs and put it out there. Get a response to see if it worth much more time into (of course he said the flip side was that if you wait too long, it might not be relevant any longer).\n\n4. Put a value to it. Jahanzeb sold his very first simple app for US$5, then added value to the product and it sold for US$15 and 15 Euros and now Jaadu is selling for US$25 on the App Store.\n\n5. Be sure you can provide Tech Support to users who will call in with all sorts of questions.\n\n6. Make sure the app is easy to instal \u2013 with guidelines for the simplest problems that users could have \u2013 so that at least 80% of the issues will be taken care of. This is what he has done.\n\n7. If Apple is keeping 30% of the revenue, they are also dealing with a lot of the headache in terms of tech support, sales, returns, etc. Well worth it. And the Apple website is a huge marketplace as the population of iPhone and iPod Touch users increases.\n\nJahanzeb, all I can say is you are a cool dude. You make us\u00a0 proud. Good luck. And if you haven\u2019t yet made your first million, you will soon! I am willing to place a bet on it. BTW next time you will have to sing.

How many times have we complained about companies, political parties and individuals defacing public property? About the lack of cleanliness and the large number of garbage dumps all over the place.\n\nI remember suggesting in an earlier post that the CDGK should not allow organizations to deface flyovers in the city with posters and painted advertisements. The City Nazim has now said that defacing of public property will be considered a criminal act. I hope implementation will be possible. More power to him for wanting to do something about it.\n\nThere seem to have begun several initiatives in the city of Karachi to improve the look, the cleanliness, the traffic situation, etc. Some of these include:\n\nThe Citizens Archive of Pakistan have started an important project for the archival of Pakistan\u2019s history and its culture. CAP is dedicated to creating and archiving material produced by and for the citizens of Pakistan. In the future, CAP hopes to create an institution that can hold archives of the stories of the people of Pakistan in a variety of media.\n\nThere are of course many telemedicine and e-Health initiatives that are taking place and some companies have taken on the mantle of educating the children of their factory workers.\n\nPerhaps if, in addition to this, each industry starts to archive information about its heroes, its innovators, its successful entrepreneurs (and by success, I don\u2019t mean just financial success), its inventors, its ideapreneurs, there will be a feel-good culture that would emerge that would then spur us on to tackle some of the really big issues. The heroes would also be a source of inspiration for current and coming generations.\n\nWe will be starting this at P@SHA by recognizing technologists and entrepreneurs in the IT sector (both local and expat Pakistanis).

Their guts, the positive steps they took to ensure that business continuity was maintained, their ability to look beyond the rubble and destruction was truly inspiring.\n\nWhat is even more amazing is that two weeks after their walls and ceilings came tumbling down, 11 of the companies have moved from their temporary locations back into the Technology Park. Once the building foundation was declared safe and the main electrical cabling was found to be unaffected, individual companies checked their internal wiring, cleared out the broken material, replaced the shattered windows with thick plastic or wooden sheets, removed the broken false ceilings and either painted the airconditioning and cable ducts or covered them with foil, brought back their computer equipment and renewed their operations from their old premises. I congratulate them on their resilience and their ability to remain positive in the worst of circumstances.\n\nMeanwhile the management of the building has apparently opened up the tenders for the renovation work.

Sometimes you even got the heavy breather who said\u00a0 nothing at all.\n\nThen came email spam. This continues till today and filters are not really totally effective. Sometimes you find legit business mail, or mail from friends, going into spam, whereas you are still stuck with getting messages telling you where you can purchase unmentionable products and services, not to mention lots of marketing spam for all sorts of things \u2013 from computers & accessories to shoes, seafood products and seminar/exhibition notices like the one mentioned by Zak on his blog.\n\nAs if this was not annoying enough, this was followed by the spamming on mobile phones. It started with your mobile operator sending you all sorts of messages that you didn\u2019t need or want, and now of course they are making your number available (at a price no doubt) to marketing companies who spam you with all sorts of smses. Shouldn\u2019t there be a law against this? And if one exists, shouldn\u2019t someone be implementing it?\n\nWhy am I whining about this particularly today? Well, for the past two days someone had been sending me smses at all times of the day and night. They were all from one person. Here are some that i remember:\n\nGood morning dear.\n\n What are you doing right now?\n\n Why don\u2019t you talk to me dear?\n\n I want friendship with you.\n\n Waiting for your response.\n\n Waiting \u2026waiting \u2026 waiting\n\n Goodnite dear.\n\n\u2026 and more of the same. Not even very creative. I mean if a person has to spam, the least they can do is be creatively original. :-)\n\nWhen I got the first message, I thought it might be someone I knew who was kidding around so I sent a message back which said \u201cDo I know you?\u201d. He (i assume it was a man, since women have not been known to pull such stunts \u2013 yes i plead guilty to bias) said \u201cNo but i want to know you\u201d. So I responded that I only communicated with people I knew and would he please stop messaging me. He didn\u2019t give up. Said something like \u201cYou will know me once we communicate\u201d. I said \u201cNo thank you \u2013 please stop bothering me\u201d to which he responded with \u201cPls keep cool\u201d.\n\nBy this time I had had it! So I sent one final message saying that if he didn\u2019t stop bothering me I would report him to the FIA. He even responded to that by telling me that it was not good to lose my temper this way. I didn\u2019t respond because by this time I had realized that my biggest mistake had been to reply to the first message.\n\nAnyway, he kept sending messages all day and night trying to get me to respond in anger or out of mere frustration. I didn\u2019t. Finally late last night my mysterious friend sent me what I hope marks the end of this saga. The message read: \u201cThis is my final message.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/10/06/open-your-eyes-and-see-what-is-around-you/", "text": "Over seven hundred people viewed my blog yesterday. I was totally overwhelmed. A couple of hundred a day was normal. As time has gone by, the number has increased but this was absolutely unexpected. Some of you have written separately to say that my optimism appeals to you. Others have told me in person that I appear to see some good in everything. Well, all I can say is if you dig deep enough, there is some good in everyone. I am sure there are a few exceptions, but generally I have found this to be true.\n\nIn one of my previous posts, I focused on the good things that are happening in Pakistan. Tonight I thought I would focus on the good things that are happening in the IT industry in Pakistan to which I belong.\n\nI meet a number of people over the course of each day and sometimes some of them who are unaware of what is happening in the Pakistan IT sector, say things like there is no growth, the IT sector has made no impact, we are working in silos, we are not connecting/networking with each other or with academia. There are some who undermine the work that is being done and the kind of innovation that is taking place across the country. To these people I have only one thing to say: Open your eyes mate.:-)\n\nOurs is a thriving industry growing at the rate of 50% per year for the past 6 years. We are being recognized across the world for the quality of work that we deliver and the kind of products that we develop. Whether we look at maturer companies like Systems Ltd, Netsol, Techlogix, LMKR, TRG, Innovative, Ultimus, Kalsoft and Ovex Technologies or younger companies like Mixit, Alchemy Technologies, PixSense, CureMD, Etilize, Scrybe, TPS, Avanza, Palmchip, Trivor, Five Rivers, Naseeb Networks, Amaana, Comcept, Jin Technologies, Folio 3, Post Amazers and Sharp Image, to mention just a few, we will see for ourselves that we have an industry that all of us should be proud of.\n\nUniversities like FAST, GIK, LUMS, IBA, Szabist, NUST, NED, MAJU, Karachi University, Punjab University, Bahria, Sir Syed etc are producing very good human resource that are helping our industry to grow. Companies from within the sector are on the Advisory Boards of most of these universities and are working with them at industry level and at an individual level to ensure that the gap between industry and academia is reduced. Many of our industry professionals are attached to these Universities as visiting faculty.\n\nIn addition to the efforts that P@SHA is making, there are other groups like Ponder Alliance that are trying to bridge the industry-academia divide. The Startup Insiders sessions have brought new energy into the sector by providing mentoring and guidance to technology graduates aspiring to be entrepreneurs. Newer setups like MITCEF, with the help of MIT Entrepreneurship Centre MD Ken Morse and members of OPEN, are assisting companies to accelerate their growth by providing a 6 month program to mid-sized companies. TiE is starting to work with renewed vigour to promote entrepreneurship in the country.\n\nMagazines like CIO have started publishing Pakistan editions. Almost all international software and hardware organizations have a presence in Pakistan. Google, that had never really taken a serious look at Pakistan before, has starting showing interest. As the number of internet users have increased, and the blogging community has become more active, and Web 2.0 and mobile applications have increasingly surfaced from our corner of the world, naturally people from outside have taken notice of us. Our companies have started attracting VC funding from outside the country.\n\nThe Pakistan IT industry is responsible for improving the processes of many other industry sectors as well as improving government services. ICT for Development is another segment that the industry has now started to venture into so that our rural sector, and the young talent that resides there, is not left behind.\n\nAll these are positive signs of growth and development, and it will continue \u2013 anyone who thinks otherwise is either ignorant or just too stubborn to see what is happening all around us. The resilience of this sector despite all the knocks it takes over and over again, is something we should all acknowledge and be proud of. I for one continue to be amazed at the talent and brilliance of the people I meet in this industry. We may have started late, and there might have been a few hiccups along the way, but we are a dynamic sector that will continue to grow and make its mark on the world stage.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Open your eyes!"},

My father, on the other hand, has always been an extremely social person. There is no city that I travel to where I do not run into a friend of my father\u2019s. Many tell me that they have either had dinner at our home in Hong Kong or the UAE, or have actually stayed with us.\n\nThere is a joke that runs in our circle that when my father used to go see off someone at the airport, he would pick up someone else \u2013 sometimes a complete stranger. During his tenure at NBP in Hong Kong, the bank had actually become a defacto consulate. People came to him for advice and assistance instead of going to the Pakistan Consulate because they had heard how hospitable and helpful he was.\n\nI remember one occasion when my father phoned me from Kai Tak airport at 6 am on a Sunday to say that he was on the way home and could I make some Halwa/Puree because he was bringing home some guests. The guests turned out to be a couple from India. They were at the airport looking completely lost because the people who were supposed to pick them up, hadn\u2019t shown up. So my father brought them home for breakfast, contacted their hosts and arranged to have them picked up from our house. The lady while thanking my father, said that he had come to their rescue like a \u201cbhagwan\u201d . I realize she said this out of gratitude and respect but my mother and us kids couldn\u2019t resist teasing him about it for days. :)\n\nAnyway, as usual, I digress. My father has maintained a lot of relationships over the years because of his caring and helpful nature. If anyone has ever done him a favour, he has never forgotten. They may be dead and gone but for generations their children and grandchildren will be showered with attention and affection. His relationship with colleagues and friends has lasted from his youth to the current day. He has kept in touch with them and their families if only through the occasional greeting card or phone call.\n\nThis was brought home to me yet again when on the second day of Eid, despite the pain in his back and legs, my father insisted that we visit the homes of two of his old colleagues/friends who had passed away. He was insistent that it was important that we go see their wives and families and see how they were faring.\n\nAnd so we did.\n\nOne such visit was with the son of one of his old NBP colleagues \u2013 Dr. Azam Shafqat (pictured here). Azam, in fact, said to him that he was amazed at his ability to maintain old relationships and keep in touch, and how nice that was. So it is Azam who is to blame for this rambling post :).", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "My father \u2026 and the importance of\u00a0relationships"},

I had left the office around 3 pm but had to go for physio, take my father to the doctor and then run some errands before I could call it a day.\n\nAs I headed home, I thought about all the negative press that this country has been getting over the past few years \u2013 both locally and internationally. Yes, we are faced with some severe problems. One would have to be blind and in denial not to recognize that. But why do we only focus on the negative? What about the good things that are happening here?\n\nAs I asked myself this question, the siren signalled Iftaar and I saw people who had set up tables on the side of the road suddenly jump to life \u2013 they were handing out dates, fruit, pakoras and roohafza to passersby in buses, cars, trucks, rickshaws etc who had not been able to reach home to break their fast. This is of course provided free. Each time I had seen this scene in the past, I had smiled, as I did now.\n\nI started to focus on other positive things that were happening around me.\n\nMy father had been in severe pain all night and I wanted him to see an Orthopaedic Specialist in case the pain got worse during the holidays. I didn\u2019t have an appointment but I smsed Dr. Najam Qureshi, who is not a personal friend, and told him what had happened with a plea for him to squeeze us into his schedule that evening. He smsed back right away saying my plea for help had been heard \u2013 I could drop in with my father and he would examine him. :)\n\nIsn\u2019t Karachi also the city where young people have offered their time to be Community Police Officers? I watch them every day as they perform their duties with complete dedication despite the scorching heat.\u00a0 I could swear they control traffic much better than the real traffic cops do. They are polite, helpful and firm.\n\nIsn\u2019t this also the country where Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital \u2013 set up by Imran Khan; offers free cancer treatment to those who can\u2019t afford it?\n\nIsn\u2019t this also the country where the Sindh Institute of Urology & Transplantation \u2013 headed by Dr. Adeeb Rizvi- offers free kidney treatment to those who can\u2019t afford it?\n\nIsn\u2019t this the country where in the aftermath of the Earthquake that hit the Northern Areas, the whole country pooled together their efforts to alleviate the suffering of those who were affected? Remember how kids, young people, old people, soldiers, technologists, medical practitioners, architects, civil society and members of the public all used their skills and resources to help in any way they could.\n\nWho hasn\u2019t heard of Abdul Sattar Edhi of the Edhi Foundation \u2013 who provide help to anyone who needs it \u2013 whether it be food, a roof over their heads, clothes, medical treatment, etc.?\n\nThen there are those who provide education to those those who can\u2019t afford to go to school \u2013 organizations like The Citizens\u2019 Foundation, CARE, the Garage School, Zindagi Trust, etc\n\nAnd what about LRBT who offer quality free eyecare \u201cbecause no man, woman or child should go blind simply because he/she cannot afford the treatment\u201d ?\n\nOr the Karachi Vocational Training Center (KVTC) \u2013 a center where people with mental challenges are taught behaviourial skills and technical skills that enable them to take on paid work and lead an independent life.\n\nOr people like Dr. Feroze who has been arranging for plastic surgery for children with severe plastic burns?\n\nIsn\u2019t this also the country where as soon as people hear that a security guard\u2019s son is very ill and needs surgery, or the roof of a woman\u2019s house has collapsed, or a poor person has contracted dengue fever, a collection is started so that the money can be gifted to the affected people?\n\nEver since I moved back to this country, I have found that the support network in Pakistan is far superior to any that exists elsewhere in the world. If I am ill or in any kind of trouble, I know all I have to do is pick up the phone and a friend will be there in minutes to offer advice or practical assistance. I also know that if I sound depressed for any reason, a friend will pop into the office to ask if everything is okay.\n\nI remember when my mother passed away, two of my oldest friends came over and took charge. I was a total wreck. Thank God for them. They took care of me as well as all the arrangements. Last year when I contracted dengue fever, it was my friends who took turns to stay with me in the hospital so that they could ensure that I was taken care of (and, believe me, I was a difficult patient!)\n\nAnd in the past few years I have seen the spirit of young entrepreneurs in this country. They are the torch bearers. They are going to lead us out of the mess that we have got ourselves into. Of course we will have to help too but together we can and will do it.\n\nSuch is the spirit in this country. Such are the people of this country.

Of course at the moment you need an invitation to get into the Beta site. Let me know if you want one. I can issue invitations now :) Inner circle and all that jazz. Lucky haan?\n\nSo what is Offstreet Workshop? The best way to find out is to go visit the site. The tagline should tell you something though. It says \u201cConnect with your city\u201d. What it basically does, in very simplistic terms, is it provides coupons of various deals that are available in your city \u2013 from shoes to restaurants to boutiques to electronics. All you do is print out the coupon and avail yourself of the deal. Hopefully this can be converted sometime into codes that can be sent to mobiles or something like that so that we don\u2019t have to end up destroying too many trees.\n\nI don\u2019t remember exactly how many stores Sha told me had registered with him in every city \u2013 if I am not wrong he said 100 or so in Karachi so far, and a large number in other cities too. The website is not restricted to any city or country. The reach is already multi-city but will be expanded over time to as many cities in the world as possible.\n\nThere is a space for products too \u2013 divided by category and searchable every which way. Offstreet workshop is also providing webstores for the companies that register their deals online.\n\nThe site is still in beta. They are planning to add\u00a0 Events/Restaurants/Cafes in each city so that if you happen to be travelling you can\u00a0 plan to go see a play or movie or attend a seminar, exhibition, talk or concert or simply have a nice meal. The main idea is that you connect with your city, avail of great deals and find out what\u2019s available in terms of products or activities.\n\nI am sure they would love to hear from potential users regarding what else they would want to see on this site. Write to them through their website or put down your comments here and i will forward it to them.\n\nGood luck guys. Keep us in the loop so we know how the project is going.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Connect with your city\u00a0\u2026"},

P@SHA is holding its 4th Annual ICT Awards on October 31, 2008 at the Marriott Hotel in Karachi. Information regarding the nominations for these awards has been circulating for some time. In addition to the existing 16 categories for Product Innovation, 4 new categories have been added for Best Call Center/BPO, Best in Service Innovation, Best Work Environment and Best in Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nThe Awards are meant to encourage and recognize innovation and creativity in the Pakistan ICT industry. We all know that there is a lot of talent in this country and, over the past couple of years, we have seen innovation creeping out of nooks and cranies. In addition to existing companies that have been around for some time, there are younger companies that have come up with creative and innovation solutions to problems that individuals or businesses are faced with. We want to highlight these companies and the work that they have done.\n\nNomination forms and a list of categories are available on the P@SHA website under Events.\n\nLast year P@SHA was unable to hold the Award event.

In fact I was told by many of the companies that they had been obnoxious to say the least. We have to talk with them and work with them regardless of course but it is sad that their humanity did not even come to the fore during such a difficult time.\n\nMeeting with the top man was illuminating. Statements like \u201cI have lost more than you have\u201d didn\u2019t endear him to the tenants, some of whom had lost members of their team. I must admit I didn\u2019t take to him at all. The grin, the arrogant posture, the machoism, and the know-it-all attitude made me want to have nothing to do with him.\n\nNaturally most of the companies wanted to know how long the restoration work would take. His answer was 3 months \u2013 long before the Marriott! Was there any need for this sort of competitiveness? I asked him if we could have a\u00a0 project plan, a breakdown, a timeline for the completion of various tasks. At first he ignored me \u2013 after all I was but a mere woman. I would have none of that of course, and finally got him to respond. Apparently, we will be provided with a proper timeline after he has had his Board Meeting over the weekend.\n\nWhat I wondered was why Operation Cleanup hadn\u2019t started. That doesn\u2019t require a lot of money. There are enough of us who would have volunteered to help. And, if needed, the army could have helped. In cases of disasters, can\u2019t they be called in? I remember that in the aftermath of the earthquake they had been very much a part of disaster relief.\n\nI was also surprised to learn that the management was planning to replace the glass on the exterior of the building with the same glass that had been there before. It was suggested that shatter-proof glass should be considered. There was a bit of resistance but eventually they did say they would look into that option.\n\nThe good news was that the foundations of the building were solid and had not been affected. One of the tenants had also independently confirmed this with a professional engineering firm. There was some discussion on cutting down restoration time by allowing the companies to get their own contractors to put in the false ceilings etc if a certain standard could be agreed upon and consensus reached on reimbursement of the amount spent. This is actually a good idea. I hope it is taken up.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "And then there are others\u00a0\u2026"},

I visited the Evacuee Trust Complex (which is adjacent to the Marriott Hotel) on Wednesday with Faisal Chohan of Brightspyre and as we negotiated our way carefully through the rubble and destruction, images of past visits flashed through my mind. This place had always been alive with energy and activity and well done up offices. I had been here so many times before. It broke my heart to see it in shambles.\n\nHowever, I was not allowed to be depressed for too long. As I entered one of the offices, i saw people in hard hats, protective eye gear and gloves going through the rubble, separating material and documents and putting them away in clearly marked boxes. They were all smiling and looking ahead with determination and confidence rather than letting depression engulf them. An amazing lot.\n\nMost of the companies within the Evacuee Trust Complex had entered the building on Sunday (as soon as they were allowed to) and removed their computers, servers and all essential equipment. Many of them already had Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Plans in place, and were up and running by Sunday night.\n\nThe goodness in people comes to the fore at times like these. Dr. Arshad Ali of NUST is one such example. It took him no time at all to offer space to affected companies at the NUST/SEECS campus so that they could continue their operations.\n\nI visited the SEECS campus and met with a couple of the companies. Dr. Arshad Ali also showed me an additional 7,000+ sq ft of space within the existing campus which he said could be made available \u2013 and all this free of any rent. We also went to the new NUST H-12 campus where he identified more space that could be converted very quickly into functionable office space for companies that may need it for a couple of months. I salute you Dr. Arshad Ali for your community spirit, for your compassion and for your readiness to assist. May God bless you.\n\nIT Companies in other locations who had additional space available also made it available to the affected companies. The PSEB started identifying buildings within Islamabad that could be converted into STPs.\n\nI met several company representatives and was proud of their resilience, their determination and their commitment to making sure that customers were not affected by what had happened. One CEO I spoke to told me that his US customer had remarked that on the 9th day after the hurricance in the US, his company was still not operational. He wondered how Islamabad companies had lost no time at all in coming online and ensuring that mission critical work was not affected. Another CEO said that because services had not been affected, his customers didn\u2019t even know that his office was totally destroyed. I have asked these companies to share their Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity plans with others so that God forbid we go through any other natural or man-made disasters, we are ready and able to deal with\u00a0 them.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Business Continuity, disaster readiness & determination in the worst of\u00a0times"},

I kept asking myself WHY? Why do people do what they do? Why do human beings cause so much death and destruction? Why has pride, anger, revenge, greed and corruption overtaken love, compassion and understanding?\n\nNo answers were forthcoming. I felt extremely helpless. All I could do was check if friends and colleagues were safe. The phone was used extensively that night and all of the next day. I mourned the loss of all the people at the Marriott. It was a hotel I frequented often \u2013 whenever I was in Islamabad. I used the Nadia Coffee Shop as a meeting place. People often asked if I had rented that corner table for the day. I had lunch there with friends. We held events there.\n\nSeeing it engulfed in flames I wondered if the guards I knew, and had seen often, were hurt. There was no way to find out since I didn\u2019t really remember their names. How would their families cope? What would happen to them? The Rs. 300,000 offered by the government was a nominal amount. The sole breadwinners were gone. Who would feed their families, educate their children, make sure there was a roof over their heads? I hoped that Mr. Sadruddin Hashwani would set up a fund to help these families until the children were old enough to take over the financial responsibilities.\n\nAdjacent to the Marriott is the Evacuee Trust Complex which houses 40 IT companies. 6 fatalities have been reported in that building. Many of the offices and furniture in ETC was smashed, people were hurt, business was impacted. I am amazed at the resilience of the companies and the teams. Several of them picked up their equipment, relocated\u00a0 and were back online in hours. Some of them worked remotely to ensure business continuity. In the days ahead we will need to work together to ensure that these companies get the assistance they need. We also need to ensure that the management clears up the debris and starts the renovation work as soon as possible. Bureaucracy must not be allowed to delay the disaster recovery effort.\n\nIt is an irony that just as we were pondering on how to celebrate World Peace Day, our peace was totally shattered. How dare these people call themselves Muslims? How dare they even refer to themselves as human beings? How dare they come into this country and terrorize and kill our children, our people? There is no way I cannot take this personally. This is my country. These are my people. They have attacked the very fabric of our society too many times. We cannot and must not allow them to get away with it. We must not let them depress us, instil fear in us or destroy us psychologically. We must forget our differences, join hands and eradicate all evil, greed and violence that exists in our society. We must take our destiny into our own hands.

The only thing that kept me (and several others) from going and applying for the card was our unwillingness to queue up for several hours at Civic Center. Yes I am lazy and there just aren\u2019t enough hours in a day. Now if they had wifi throughout the city, I might consider it ;)\n\nYesterday I noticed that there was an online form on the CDGK website so I started filling it up to volunteer my time on Saturday and Sunday evening to help in the area of Services for Education and Public Awareness and also to volunteer to participate in the Suggestion Committee. I was excited that I would finally be able to do something concrete to help the City Government instead of just grumbling about the state of the city.\n\nI wish there had been an option in the form which asked for volunteers to switch off the street lights which remain on till way past 10 am sometimes. Talk about saving energy \u2013 we may not need to consider an extra holiday or close down the petrol pumps on Friday if we switch off the street lights at dawn. Anyway, no such volunteer task existed. So I figured I would start somewhere and volunteer for the tasks that were available. It didn\u2019t happen though. Why not?\n\nWell, I tried to fill in my Date of Birth but that field wouldn\u2019t work. Actually I don\u2019t understand why they need to know how old I am. Why ask for more information than you need? I can understand them wanting my NIC number and my contact information but my date of birth?\u00a0 I wonder if their site has a Privacy Policy.

Then suddenly they knew \u2013 it was Steve Jobs! How could they have not recognized him, they asked themselves. He was just so very pale and thin \u2013 much worse than when the media last made a fuss about his health going downhill.\n\nAs you can imagine, I was very depressed when I received the email. Jobs & Woz ARE Apple and, having been a Mac User since 1984,\u00a0 and before that I had tinkered for a while with the Apple IIe. I just couldn\u2019t bear the thought of this icon, this man who had made technology \u2018cool\u2019 being that ill!\n\nBut if he is seriously ill (he does appear to be very thin), it is certainly not affecting his sense of humour. He started his Keynote presentation at the Special September Apple event with the above slide. Borrowed from Mark Twain of course, the slide reads, \u201cThe reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.\u201d Amazing guy, I tell you!\n\nHe then went on to launch the fourth generation of the iPod Nano \u2013 the thinnest and sleekest one yet! In nine vibrant colours! I wanted them all \u2013 as I am sure did most of the people who were watching the keynote. What would I do with all 9? I don\u2019t know. Maybe one for every day of the week \u2013 plus two for special occasions. Who knows? Desire cannot be explained or rationalized. Of course there is no way I am going to buy all 9 but that doesn\u2019t stop me from wanting to!\n\nBut where does the wanting stop? If you look at the new iPod Touch \u2013 extremely thin, contoured, with a longer battery life (36 hours of audio and 6 hours of video), built-in speaker, built-in wifi support for the Nike+iPod rock \u2018n run, not to mention the App Store providing hundreds of games and innovative applications \u2026. I want! I want! I want! Sigh!\n\nThe Apple event in September is usually focused on music so naturally in addition to the nano and the iPod Touch, all eyes were on where Apple\u2019s iTunes was headed next. And iTunes 8.0 was certainly no disappointment.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s Genius \u2013 a brilliant way to create perfect playlists and rediscover your music. Play a song, click the Genius button, and iTunes creates a playlist of other songs from your library that go great together. Then there is the Genius Side Bar \u2013 as you select songs within your library that go well together, the Genius Side Bar selects songs on the iTunes store that fit perfectly with the songs in your library. Of course since we can\u2019t access the iTunes store from Pakistan, this is unfortunately little use to us.\n\nIt just keeps getting better. Seeing music, tv shows and movies using cover art is totally amazing. And let\u2019s not forget Accessibility. iTunes 8 is screen-reader friendly. Yay Apple!!! Is it any wonder that Apple has sold 160 million iPods to date. More power to you Steve!\n\nThe new headphones have a pause/play and volume control (something iPod users have been asking for), double click takes you to next song, triple click takes you to the previous, right from the cable, and there\u2019s a microphone for voice recording.

The young guest on the show said she had completed her Masters in Computer Science from the UK and had then returned to Pakistan only to find that she was unable to get a job for 16 months. She couldn\u2019t get past the interview because of her speech disorder.\n\nI wasn\u2019t clear whether she wasn\u2019t able to get a job because she couldn\u2019t communicate easily with the person who phoned to set it up or was it that companies didn\u2019t shortlist her because of her speech defect? If it was the latter, I will be very disappointed. For certain jobs good communication skills are certainly essential but for fresh programmers, isn\u2019t the ability to work with colleagues and team leads sufficient? I would have thought it would be her analytical and coding skills that they would be looking at.\n\nSince November she has obviously gained a lot of confidence because she was able to have a discourse on television with very little trouble. Most of us who don\u2019t stammer would have started to stammer out of fear of being on screen. She did a good job pointing out what the issues are \u2013 the lack of sensitivity mainly \u2013 like mimicking a person who stammers, making fun of them, completing sentences for them because of impatience, making faces, feeling sorry for them, thinking of them as handicapped.\n\nThe First Blast team followed this up by bringing on two kids who stammer \u2013 a young woman with a CS degree who is presently employed at Sidat Hyder and apparently very happy there, and a young man who is studying CS at Szabist. Both of them talked about lack of confidence that initially kept them from doing the things they wanted to.\u00a0 These two young people seem to be well on their way to achieving their potential due to the support they received from The Stammering\u00a0 Association and the encouragement they got from their parents, who told them that nothing was impossible if they would only reach out and make the effort.\n\nI think it is great that the team from The First Blast is talking about these things. As Sonia pointed out when talking to her guests, sometimes we do things with good intentions, believing that we are providing assistance \u2013 like finishing sentences for others, when in fact it is one of the things that irritates people with speech defects the most. So much to learn, so little time.\n\nBiases, prejudice, making fun of those who are different from us are all weaknesses in our own character that each of us needs to address.

Will people not go out because it is a holiday? Remember the last time this was attempted? I understand that energy/oil usage needs to be reduced but can\u2019t there be more creative ways of doing it?\n\nHow about declaring a subsidy (carbon credit reinsured) for companies that set up alternate energy generation \u2013 non-fossil fuel \u2013 or other such initiatives. Remember the economy is in tatters as well and if we shut down offices for another day, will that really help ease the economic crisis? As it is Friday is more or less a half day because of the 3 hour lunch breaks. Do we really need more holidays?\n\nAs for closing down petrol pumps on Friday, that is a non-starter.

Yes, Adnan Agboatwalla decided (after some nudging from the PixSense team, no doubt) to rent lush green plants. That\u2019s right, you heard right! I did say rent. The guy comes in, instals the plants, makes sure they are watered and taken care of and replaced whenever necessary.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how much difference a few plants can make. It reflects on the people too. Everyone looks fresher despite Ramadan. And the fish certainly look happier! :)\n\nYesterday I was watching The First Blast on Dawn News \u2013 Sonia Rahman was interviewing the Country Head of IUCN Ms. Nikhat Sattar. They were talking about conservation and how each one of us can help. From planting trees to growing plants, to turning off lights, fans and air conditioning when they are not really needed, to using less water. Simple little things that can help save the environment.\n\nHowever, when it was suggested that we should stop using public transport that exude black smoke, I started to wonder. How can a person who does not have any alternate means of transport, really avoid using those buses and rickshaws that are responsible for a lot of pollution? Why not take the plunge and go totally CNG. I saw the difference it made to the air in Delhi. If India can implement it, why can\u2019t we?

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/09/09/get-involved-now/", "text": "It is said that a Policy is a guiding principle that influences decisions and defines a plan of action. While developing policy one has to keep in mind all alternatives that are available. The choice or selection of programs and spending priorities is made based on their impact. So, as I understand it, a Policy leads to proactive decision-making as opposed to reactive decision-making.\n\nThe vision for any Policy should be a long term one. Does this mean that the Policy, once defined, should be carved in stone? No, in this day and age, I would expect it to be a live document that is revisited and reviewed frequently and amended whenever necessary.\n\nBeing part of a policy making process is a great responsibility and it should not be taken lightly. Wide stakeholder involvement is also imperative if the policy is to impact on the broader economic and social development activity of a country. An ICT policy would therefore impact on the ICT sector as well as on ICT inn education, health, urban and rural development and on the enhancement of business and entrepreneurial activity.\n\nPolicies are formally put in place by governments so perhaps one could argue that the business sector and civil society have no role to play. WRONG! A broad range of stakeholders need to provide input into the policy making process. A policy can only be successfully drafted and\u00a0 implemented with the active involvement of all parties. The government only needs to create an environment for this to happen.\n\nPakistan has started the process right. Participants from Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad gathered at the kick-off meeting which was organized by the Ministry of IT & Telecom and PSEB in Lahore on Monday.\n\nRepresenting the government were the Federal Secretary IT Mr. Hifzur Rahman, Acting MD PSEB Talib Baloch, Parliamentary Secretary IT Mr. Shaukatullah, Project Director Muhammad Anwer, Mr. Ammar Jaffri Project Director FIA, Mr. Muhammar Amir Malik Director ICT PTA and Mr. Salman Khalid Project Director SMEDA. The private sector comprised IT practitioners and other representatives from business and civil society.\n\nIt was a productive and interactive session where a lot of ideas were shared. One of the suggestions was that the policy should not be limited to IT because Communication technologies have become very much a part of the IT scenario and hence ICT is the term that should be used. Convergence of technologies needs to be kept in mind when drafting a policy for the sector. If you have views on the subject, speak up now.\n\nThe public space wiki has been set up on the following address:\n\n http://pakistanitpolicy.pbwiki.com\n\nWe are following the development process that was suggested and approved on 1st of September 2008 during the Lahore Meeting. It is available at::\n\n http://pakistanitpolicy.pbwiki.com/Process+Page+for+IT+Policy+2008\n\nThe ICT Policy 2.0 Vision Draft is available for editing and comments at:\n\n http://pakistanitpolicy.pbwiki.com/Vision\n\nThe ICT Policy 2.0 Overarching Principles are available for editing and\n\n comments at:\n\n http://pakistanitpolicy.pbwiki.com/Overarching-Principles\n\nA list of Stakeholders of the ICT Policy 2.0 have been listed and is\n\n available for editing and comments at:\n\n http://pakistanitpolicy.pbwiki.com/Stakeholders\n\nAn open group has been setup at: http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=30136677675\n\nAnyone in Pakistan or from outside Pakistan who wishes to contribute to the process is invited to join the wiki, leave comments on Facebook or send an email to:\n\n pakistanictpolicy@yahoogroups.com\n\nGet involved now and contribute towards the development of a policy that could impact positively on all of us if we help move it in the right direction.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Get involved now!"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/09/03/it-policy-consultation-kicks-off/", "text": "Most of us are usually quite skeptical about any government consultation and even when we do make the effort to attend such a meeting, we do so out of a sense of obligation expecting very little from the activity.\n\nHence, as we boarded the plane for Lahore at 8 am on September 1 to attend the IT Policy kick-off meeting we did so with reservation. Some of our colleagues had vehemently shrugged off any suggestion of making the trip saying it would be a total waste of time.\n\nOn the flight with me were Barrister Zahid Jamil, Awab Alvi (better known as Teeth Maestro), Faizan Khan of Intel Corporation, Faisal Anwar of UBL and Tabasum Abbasi from the Sindh IT Department. We knew Shahzad Ahmed of BytesforAll would be flying in from Islamabad for the meeting and that some of our colleagues from Lahore \u2013 Imran Zia (Chairman of P@SHA), Hasan Rizvi\u00a0 (CEO of Five Rivers Technologies), Fouad Bajwa (FOSS Mullah) and Dr. Sarmad Hussain from FAST \u2013 would be joining us. Hence there was every reason to believe that an attempt would be made to make things happen.\n\nAs we walked into Crystal Ballroom A at the PC, we came face-to-face with our worst fears as we saw the seating arrangements for the event. There was a stage with 6 chairs, a second tier of seating and then the third tier of round tables with chairs for those we assume were perceived as commoners.\n\nImran Zia and I were asked to join the VIPs on the stage. We politely refused the invitation on the grounds that this was supposedly a consultative process and we were there as\u00a0 equal stakeholders with the rest of the participants. That didn\u2019t stop the speeches from happening of course. I don\u2019t know if I can blame them really \u2013 some people only know one way of doing things and for them to imagine that a meeting can take place without the normal bureaucratic hooplah is just not possible. So we listened quietly like well-behaved little boys and girls and even applauded on cue.\n\nTo expect such behaviour to last long would be unnatural so it was not surprising that when we were asked to break up into Working Groups, we rebelled \u2013 politely of course ;-) We suggested that it would be best to break for tea/coffee at that stage while the seating arrangement was converted into what would at least seem to be more consultative stakeholder seating. This suggestion was met with shock, confusion and a wee bit of resistance until the Federal IT Secretary, who is a cool and reasonable dude, said \u201cso be it\u201d.\n\nWhile everyone else had tea, coffee and cookies, a bunch of us zealots converged to one of the round tables and, as you can see, gleefully put together a revised agenda for the meeting. Yup this is the guilty group. Then why is it that only I was accused of \u201chijacking\u201d the meeting? :( That\u2019s right \u2013 innocent little me!\n\nAnyway, to get back to the story. When the meeting restarted we asked the IT Secretary if we could propose a revised agenda. He looked as if he was in two minds whether to agree to anything that this bunch proposed. But as I said before, he is a reasonable man and perhaps he could see that though we didn\u2019t look it, we were a well-meaning bunch :-) Yup, lo and behold, he said yes!\n\nSo up went the 5 slides we had put together. I won\u2019t take you through all the gruesome details \u2013 maybe I will do another post for that. Suffice it to say that what we proposed was that instead of developing the policy in silos, we should first decide on the vision and overarching principles which each of the focus groups would abide by. What do I mean? Well, wouldn\u2019t it be sensible to first decide that\u00a0 whatever each group proposed should be for example technology neutral, gender-sensitive and should keep in mind things like Accessibility and Transparency amongst other things. Should we also not decide who the various stakeholders would be, who would have ownership, whether the groups would be issue-based or sectoral? You know, important stuff like that. And what about funding? Where would that come from? This time everyone \u2013 from business representatives to civil society types \u2013 had all travelled to the venue at their own expense. Considering that they were giving free consulting time, shouldn\u2019t their costs be picked up by the government?\n\nShould we also not have baseline data to start with? And shouldn\u2019t a Gap Analysis be conducted before we jump into working groups and recommendations?\u00a0 Policies are not made overnight, is what we tried to emphasize upon. I think the message did seep in that we were trying to help ensure that the exercise was not a futile one.\n\nYou know what was truly a great experience \u2013 the fact that our group of rebels constituted IT practitioners, enntrepreneurs, civil society representatives, a banker, a lawyer, a dentist, academics and a researcher. And we were all on the same wavelength and working towards one common objective. Isn\u2019t that something to celebrate?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "IT Policy Consultation kicks\u00a0off"},

If drafted well, it will result in an interview call followed by employment with a company of your choice.\n\nIt is no wonder then that the Resume Writing workshop at the P@SHA Career Expo in Karachi and Lahore were so well attended, and carried on well beyond the allocated time. In Karachi it was very professionally conducted by Nouman Sheikh. In Lahore the task was\u00a0 undertaken jointly by P@SHA Chairman Imran Zia and myself.\n\nAmongst the tips that were provided were the following:\n\n 1. Customize your CV and cover letter for the job for which you are applying instead of sending out a standard cover letter and resume.\n\n 2. Highlight the skillsets that the job requires and you possess.\n\n 3. Don\u2019t be dishonest but present your capabilities in the best possible light.\n\n 4. Do not waste the first page with personal details\n\n 5. Start with your professional skills, achievements and awards and projects that are relevant to the job you are applying for (if you are a fresh graduate)\n\n 6. Start with your professional skills, experience and achievements (if you are an experienced person)\n\n 7. Do not send an email to a whole lot of companies \u2013 they will not glance at your CV because they will realize that you actually have no specific interest in the job that they have posted or in their company.\n\n 8. A cover note is essential \u2013\u00a0 and if it contains special reference to the company and the work it is involved in, you will create a better impression.\n\n 9. Spellcheck your resume\n\n 10. Do not use fancy fonts, graphics or multiple colours \u2013 it does not reflect professionalism\n\n11. Make sure the resume is crisp and does not include irrelevant information\n\n 12. Do not use email addresses like hotchick@hotmail.com or sexydude@yahoo.com to apply for a job. Use your university ID or create an address that contains your name or initials.\n\n 13. If you are attaching a photograph with your resume, make sure it is not a photo that is more suitable for a modeling job.\n\nThese were just some guidelines. A lot of questions came from the audience which both of us fielded.\n\nAfter the session Imran and I were approached by a lot of youngsters who wanted us to look at their CVs and guide them on how to make it a more effective representation of their abilities. Zaeem Yaqoob Khan from Naseeb Networks and who is also attached to the University of Central Punjab (UCP), joined us in assisting the young people. After all, that was why we were all there.\n\nWhat is important to remember is that a good resume is well designed both in content and form. The form should make the content stand out\u00a0 \u2013 that is its purpose. Many people use fanciness to hide the poor content and hence end up with what is tantamount to junk.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Virtually presentable"},

However, when I was told that half the Computer Science class was young women and that it would be extremely motivating for the students if I could somehow manage to go and speak there, I had to stop and think.\n\nThe NEDians are persuasive to say the least and so I juggled my schedule and decided to take the afternoon flight to Lahore so that I could go to ITEC in the morning.\n\nAnd I am sure glad I did. From the moment I stepped onto their campus, I met some very bright and motivated young people who had obviously\u00a0 put in a lot of time and effort into organizing the event. The faculty, the Head of Computer Science Mr. M.Khan Pathan, the Pro Vice Chancellor and the Vice Chancellor were also very warm and welcoming. It was obvious that they were proud of their students and especially Masroor, the young man who had visualized ITEC and he and the rest of the team had worked very hard to implement it.\n\nThis was the first time that an event of this kind was held at NED. It comprised a conference segment, an inter-university software competition, a gaming competition, software projects and a logic quiz. Some of the projects developed by the youngsters were really very cutting edge and provided solutions to problems that businesses are facing as well as problems faced by the community.\n\nDuring the conference segment I spoke about the size and growth of the industry over the past 5 years and highlighted the amout of innovation taking place in the Pakistan ICT sector \u2013 some of it driven by companies while some of it is driven by highly energized young people fresh out of universities. I talked about the contribution women were making to the sector and how some companies were creating flexible programs that would create more opportunities for women to join the ICT workforce without neglecting their other responsibilities.\n\nIt was good to see that IT companies like Folio 3, Kalsoft, Mazik and Intel were sponsors of this event. I am sure that everyone involved in ITEC is happy with the results. Well done kids!

Is this an indication that you will soon be put out to pasture? That was the question I asked myself when Rabia Garib and CIO Pakistan gave out the Technology Pioneer Awards at their launch event.\n\nHey but wait a minute! Amongst the pioneers were young people like Naila Kasim, Khurram Kalia and Umar Saif (yes he is young!). So age was certainly not a consideration.\n\nI must admit I have never thought of myself as a pioneer, although at Enabling Technologies, Zak, Nuz, Sabeen and I did come up with some firsts in the area of multimedia in the early nineties when multimedia was just a buzz word in this country and no-one really knew its potential. I remember the media played it up quite a bit (Rabia must have been a toddler then:) ) and it felt good being part of a team that was doing something different and exciting. Times have changed and now it gives me a high to talk about, and promote, young people who are producing innovative solutions in ICT.\n\nOver the years there have been some awards given out in this country where one is supposed to nominate oneself (no CIO is not one of those). I remember being approached a couple of times to nominate myself for one award or another, but I felt it was pretty odd to fill in a document stating why I should be recognized for something noteworthy that I had done. Naturally I thanked them but refused to do any such thing. Isn\u2019t recognition something that someone else bestows on you because they feel you deserve it?\n\nHaving said that, I have to admit that the award given to me by CIO made me feel good. It wasn\u2019t for being a pioneer (so I guess there is still time before I am put out to pasture). It was in recognition for my \u201cSpecial contribution to the Pakistan iT industry\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t know if the contribution I have made is worth acknowledging but I certainly do know one thing.\u00a0 I have great faith in the IT industry and where it is headed. There is already a lot of innovation taking place. There are successful business models. There is a cluster of people and companies across the country who have proven that no challenge or hurdle is big enough to keep them back.

His trips to Karachi are normally flying visits but at least we get to see him and catch up on what\u2019s happening in his life.\n\nHe and his wife Faiza alway comes loaded with chocolates, shortbread and cakes as well as other goodies \u2013 some edible, others not. This time was no different. However, the first day he was here he asked me if I didn\u2019t think that the 15\u2033 television set in my bedroom was a tad bit too small. I shrugged and said \u201cNo not really.\u201d I usually have it running in the background \u2013 mostly news channels \u2013 and my bedroom is not that large so it suffices. And I am only home at night so don\u2019t have much time to watch it anyhow. My father has a 42\u2033 plasma in his room (given to him by my baby brother on one of his previous visits) so should I want to watch tennis or cricket on a larger screen, I can always watch it with him in his room.\n\nObviously Samar didn\u2019t think that made sense at all so the next day when I got home from work, I found him walking in with a 32\u2033 Sony Brava television. He moved my 15\u2033 television set onto the floor and installed this smashing new plug-and-play system in its place (that is why Jawwad Farid wants to be adopted by him).\n\nAs an elder sister I had to of course chide him for wasting money but I think my fascination with the new television made the scolding quite ineffective :).\n\nMuch as I love the television and all the other goodies that he brought, there was one gift that he gave me (or rather something he gave himself) that I consider the best gift of all.\n\nEver since he went to England years ago to study, Samar had started smoking. Ammi and I had often tried to convince him to give it up for health reasons. But like most smokers he kept saying that he had reduced the number of cigarettes he smoked, blah blah blah blah \u2026. When he arrived in Karachi this time he told me that he had stopped smoking (NOT \u2018given it up\u2019 because that sounds like a sacrifice). This had happened a week back after he had attended a 5-hour workshop/counseling session. No gift he has ever given me has meant as much to me as this. I have often worried about his lungs, his heart, his BP and the general state of his health but I had stopped nagging him about it because I knew that the only way he would stop smoking would be if he decided that it was time to stop. I am glad that time has come. I know it is early days but I also know him. Once he makes a decision to do something, he does it. Well done baby brother!

Yes it is time for a vendetta \u2013 that appears to be the general mood. So what if Adnan has always been nice to me. He has sublet P@SHA great office space. He has always readily sponsored SI sessions and various P@SHA activities. He always has something funny to say and provides honest feedback.\n\nBUT nonetheless\u2026.. i am going to hold him responsible for the pain I am going through. Walking up 5 flights every day when there is no electricity is to blame for the condition I am in. Why isn\u2019t the elevator on a generator?\n\nHey I have to blame someone. It couldn\u2019t possibly be my fault, could it? It couldn\u2019t be that I have never taken care of my muscles and bones. Nope it just has to be someone else\u2019s fault. So why not pick on Adnan!\n\nWhat the hell am I talking about, you may ask. Well, I went to my orthopaedist last night because from Friday onwards, my knees have been giving me a lot of trouble. In fact sitting down or standing up results in torturous pain \u2013 more so in the right knee than in the left. I have never been able to bear pain so off I went to the doc after my teleconference ended at 7.15 pm.\n\nThe orthopaedist, a very handsome and pleasant one I must add, is used to me bringing in my dad for problems related to his back and legs. When he saw me walk in alone, he asked what was up. I told him my knees were giving me trouble. He fired the following questions at me immediately: \u201cThey are relatively okay when you are walking on a straight surface? Sitting down and standing up or walking up and down stairs is when the torture begins?\u201d I replied in the affirmative to all those questions. He shook his head and said \u201cwear and tear\u201d. Then he asked \u201cDo you want to stem the tide and lead a long and pain-free existence?\u201d I nodded enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cWell then,\u201d he said \u201cyou must do exactly what I say.\u201d Oh oh \u2026 that sounded ominous. He examined the knees and confirmed that his suspicions were correct. Told me to get xrays done so that he could see the extent of the wear and tear, prescribed anti-inflammatory pills and painkillers and a muscle relaxant. And of course he said i had to go for at least 20 sessions of physio. I grimaced but said I would. Warm oil massage was also part of the therapy that was suggested.\n\n\u201cAfter we have brought the inflammation down I want you to do just one thing for me,\u201d said the handsome doctor. \u201cStart swimming.\u201d Apparently swimming is the best form of exercise to keep the muscles and bones in optimal condition.

The Project, dubbed DonateBandwidth, \u00a0is a follow-up project of the Poor Man\u2019s Broadband work which was featured in New Scientist in Nov\u201907.\n\nWith DonateBandwidth, users in the developing-world can help each other by donating their unused bandwidth to those who need it. This project received funding from the US State Department/NAS and HEC and will be further developed in collaboration with UC Berkeley.\n\nUmar compares the project to distributed computing schemes such as SETI@Home, which uses volunteers\u2019 spare computer power to collaboratively analyze radio signals from space, looking for signs of intelligent life. \u201cDonateBandwidth permits sharing of unused Internet bandwidth, which is much more valuable in the developing world, compared to computing cycles or disk space,\u201d he says.\n\nIt is rare that research in Pakistan catches the attention of a publication like the Technology Review.

Well, since it is a laptop that you have been using for a year and a half, it is certainly not worth having repaired at such an enormous cost. So you look at replacing it.\n\nYou have been a Mac User since 1984 so naturally you look at what is available in the Apple stable, and at what price. Then you think \u201cHey why am I using my own personal laptop for what is mainly officially work? Why should I not have an official laptop?\u201d So you requisition for one through official channels, and you are told that there is no reason for you to be using a MacBook when cheaper PC laptops are available for between 50-80K.\n\nCan you imagine the jolt a MacUser gets when she is asked to even consider converting to a PC after 24 years of using a Mac? It is totally unfathomable. Being a Mac User is a way of life, an extension of yourself, it defines who you are and what you stand for, it enables you to be free and creative in your expression \u2013 to write, to design, to blog, to develop, to use technology without needing to worry about multiple reboots, viruses and frozen screens, not to mention the learning curve that is required for this conversion. Some things are worth doing\u2026 but losing productivity to learn a whole new, bad, system \u2026 how can that be worth doing at all?\n\nIt is not that one does not understand a decision based on pure costs but should that be the only criteria when making a decision that could impact on the productivity of an individual? Part of being productive is working in comfort\u2026 definitely worth paying for. Just like driving a car or flying a plane, using a Mac becomes intuitive. The technology does not get in the way. A Mac just enables you to do what you do productively and effectively. Not to mention the extra things one ends up doing for an organization simply because it is such a pleasure using your platform of choice.\n\nWhy, if you have been a Mac User for 24 years, should you switch to a platform that would result in you having to learn applications that substitute what you do instinctively on a Mac, to work around things that PCs don\u2019t do, and to face the additional challenges that PC users need to in order to work in peace. It is a huge loss of work time, and certainly not time that one has at one\u2019s disposal, as ceo of a fast-moving organisation.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "How does one\u00a0react?"},

We have watched them over the years as they have involved themselves in improving teachers\u2019 internet skills, publishing a number of internet magazines and getting into media relations, and producing IT shows for television, etc etc.\n\nThey have done everything with a passion \u2013 Rabia in the forefront, and Salaina as her shadow helping in most instances to ensure that things are pulled together and work the way they are supposed to.\n\nAs CIO Pakistan was launched this week, they proved how far they have come in a decade. As I arrived at the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi on August 5, I was not surprised to see most of the major players from the IT industry present at the event \u2013 they were all there \u2013 many local IT company heads from Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad and international players from Oracle, IBM, Cisco. We even had Dilawar Syed from Yahoo Inc and OPEN Silicon Valley and Rishi Jaitly from Google Inc.\n\nRabia announced that Pakistan was the 36th country in which CIO was launching an edition. It was meant to be a monthly with 90% of the content being from Pakistan. So if you have successful products, companies, initiatives that you want CIO to cover, do get in touch with Rabia. She can only promote our industry if we assist her to do it.\n\nA ribbon cutting ceremony unveiled the huge first cover. Sindh IT Minister Muhammad Raza Haroon did the honours.\n\nThe morning had everyone on a high as people networked and got to know each other or re-acquaint themselves with those they hadn\u2019t met for a while. The speeches and panel discussion were followed by the prestigious Technology Pioneer Awards (more about this later). Event organizers Terrabiz too should be congratulated for handling everything with great precision.\n\nGreat going Rabia! Well done!

I got up very early, put finishing touches to a presentation I had to make at 9 at the Sheraton and headed out with barely enough time to make it to the meeting. Made it 5 mins before I was supposed to.\n\nAs I connected my laptop to the projection system, there was a mini explosion and my MacBook Pro died. It just wouldn\u2019t start. And this had to be the one time I didn\u2019t have my presentation on a flash drive. So I had to adlib it.\n\nAfter my meeting I went to the computer doctor to find out what was wrong with the MBP. He said obviously something had blown but he would have to keep it so that it could be checked out. He gave me the hard disk and it was so sweet of him to loan me a MacBook Air so that my work wouldn\u2019t be interrrupted (ohhhhhhh the MacBook Air is so cool! I am lusting over it)\n\nAs I left the computer shop, a woman reversed her car into mine smashing the left front side of the car and shaking me up completely. And then she had the gall to tell me off! I was so stunned that I just looked at her and let her drive away.\n\nI went back to the office but the elevator wasn\u2019t working and I didn\u2019t have the energy to walk up 5 flights so I came home and worked out of the house the remainder of the day. As I pondered over my day, I thought \u201cShould I have got out of bed this morning?\u201d\n\nThis week has been really rough with my father giving us quite a scare, and now the laptop and the car. Boy am I glad the week has come to an end. I will start afresh next week.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Ever have one of those days when you wished you had stayed in\u00a0bed?"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/08/04/the-constant-stream-of-visitors-spoke-volumes/", "text": "Each time we organize an event, there are dissenting voices warning us that it is not needed \u2013 that it won\u2019t work, that we are bound to fall flat on our faces. We listen to those voices because we value different points of view. However, very often I feel that pessimism often keeps people from trying to do something that might benefit a significant group of people.\n\nI guess the entrepreneurial spirit within me wants to take the risk. I know there is a chance of failure but if you believe strongly enough in something, and you work hard toward it, isn\u2019t it a risk worth taking? We are always telling aspiring entrepreneurs not to fear failure. So then shouldn\u2019t we practice what we preach?\n\nWhen we decided to hold the P@SHA Career Expo again this year, there were some dissenting voices telling us it wasn\u2019t needed, that companies were not hiring, that there weren\u2019t enough good people available out there, that no-one wanted to attend workshops.\n\nThe Karachi event showed that this wasn\u2019t true. Some companies posted as many as 80 vacant positions, young people came out in large numbers to attend the event, to network, to attend workshops and seek counseling.\n\nWhen we headed for Pindi, the voices of doom warned us that the Pindi/Islamabad market was different, and we should cancel the event. I must admit I was concerned when a couple of the larger players decided not to participate. However, we decided to go ahead anyway because we recalled the excitement of the Pindi crowd the year before.\n\nThe night of August 1, I was restless wondering how the next day would pan out. The team and I had worked real hard; we had good supportive partners and a reasonable number of good companies who were putting up booths. There were speakers and counselors lined up \u2013 people willing to give their time to show direction to young people. But would the jobseekers show up, I asked myself? Boy did they! There were thousands of them \u2013 more than twice as many as last year.\n\nEven before the companies had their booths ready, the young people started pouring into the PC Marquee Area in Rawalpindi. As the day progressed the numbers just kept increasing. The companies were kept busy, as were the counselors, and the workshops were packed to capacity as they had been in Karachi.\n\nOwais Anjum ran the first session on \u201cHiring Fresh Gruaduates \u2013 An Employer\u2019s Perspective\u201d. I joined him part of the way through and both of us answered a lot of questions that were fired at us. There were also a couple of people in the audience from training organizations and multinationals who contributed with suggestions and shared their own experiences. That added value to the interaction.\n\nThe next workshop on Presentation Skills was run by me. There was no impromptu panel that joined me this time (as had happened in Karachi) so I was on my own. But the questions were so good and the interest so high that it became a very intense session. No chance of anyone falling asleep. Interestingly enough, at the end of the session, someone from the Aga Khan Skills Development Unit came up to me and asked if I would be able to run the session in the less developed parts of Pakistan. We exchanged contact information and I guess some of us should get together and fill this need if it does indeed exist.\n\nAs the day progressed it got busier. The Counselors were in great demand too. Thanks to the BearingPoint Counseling team, the ones Brightspyre brought in and the ones who came at my request. They worked so patiently with the young visitors, helped them with career selection and career growth and with their CVs. It was great to see. Thank you guys and gals.\n\nThe introduction of the Special Interest Group session on Rich Web Applications was a welcome addition. And experts Owais Anjum and Atta from Numetrics and Faizan Buzdar from Scrybe discussed the growing use of Rich Web Applications and how they were changing the way customers interacted with corporations. Partly technical and partly concentrating on UI and customer interaction, it was a very useful session. It is hoped that this will become a regular SIG that can be a platform for sharing ideas and knowledge.\n\nThe Startup Insiders session wrapped up the Career Expo in Pindi. On the panel were Imran Zia \u2013 Chairman of P@SHA, Atif Mumtaz \u2013 coFounder of Brightspyre, Faizan Buzdar \u2013 CEO of Scrybe, Faisal Butt \u2013 CEO of Tribal Monsoon and Faisal Chohan CEO of Cogilent. I was the self-appointed moderator.\n\nThe theme was \u201cTransitioning from being an employee to becoming an entrepreneur\u201d. Each of the speakers started by giving an introduction of themselves and telling the audience why they had decided to give up a salaried position to become an entrepreneur; what was it that drove them to take the plunge. After the introductions I opened up the session to the audience so that their questions could be answered.\n\nThe SI sessions have now started breaking out into useful one-to-one or one-to- several mentoring and coaching sessions on specific segments but since this time the SI was part of the overall P@SHA Career Expo it was felt that an audience-driven Q&A approach would work better. And so it did.\n\nThere were loads of questions \u2013 how to deal with the fear of losing a well-paid job at Teradata to start your own business, dealing with failure, how does one know that the time is right to start a venture, where to get the money, how to convince parents and family that this is the right move, etc etc.\n\nEach person on the panel dealt with the questions in his/her own unique way. Faizan tried anecdotes and personal experience which worked well with the audience. Atif was very encouraging and talked about the struggles that he had learnt from, Imran played a Kasauti-type game with people in the audience to bring out their fears and deal with them, Faisal talked about the experience of going from a service driven model to a product driven model and returning again to a service driven model.\n\nAll of us pointed out that there was now an eco-system of mentors and coaches and entrepreneurs willing to help and advise young aspiring entrepreneurs. However, the panel all agreed that not everyone was cut out to be in business for himself/herself. Only you could know whether you were an entrepreneur at heart. And if an idea or concept kept you awake nights, the best time to try it out would be when you had less financial obligations and could afford to fail. The first few failures could be the beginnings of future success. Even VCs are more inclined to bet on someone who has failed a few times!\n\nJawwad Farid\u2019s book on Venture Failure was mentioned. Overall it was a very good interactive session.\n\nIt had been a great day for organizers, exhibitors and participants alike. The Ambassadors from MAJU and NUST did a terrific job once again. Some of them had been with us at the previous event and were therefore able to lead. The Brightspyre team were wonderful collaborators. And the P@SHA team \u2013 Mustafa and Sadia \u2013 were brilliant and put in every possible effort to ensure that everything went according to plan.\n\nThe day ended perfectly for me when I received a call from a friend whose organization had set up a booth only because I had nagged him into doing it. He said to me that he had heard from his team that the event was a fantastic success, to which I commented \u201cYou sound surprised \u2026 you are a cynic my friend.\u201d His reply made my day \u2013 \u201cI am always happy to be proved wrong \u2026 \u201c, he said :)", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The constant stream of visitors in Pindi spoke\u00a0volumes"},

So I said I would be at Copper Kettle at 4 pm on Sunday. And I actually made the effort. I am so glad I did.\n\nNot only was it a pleasure to listen to Asim and Ammar talk about why they had set up Teabreak.pk and where they were intending to take it, it was just as interesting to see that 18 bloggers turned up for this activity. Shows how much respect these guys command in the blogging community.\n\nThere were the more well-known bloggers like Teeth Maestro, Ramala Akhtar and Jamash and then there were others that I had come across while surfing but didn\u2019t really know. It was good to hang out with them and find out why they started blogging, what they blogged about, how often they blogged and what they thought of the entire blogging phenomenon.\n\nMost of these were youngsters but I will tell you one thing \u2013 the wealth of knowledge, talent and passion that I could see in that small group, was enough to make me feel that there is much to be hopeful about.

Gus Hosein and Dave Banisar, his PI colleagues, cringed when he said that and some of us are still trying to understand what he meant.\n\nAnyhow, he got our attention. Maybe that was all he wanted to achieve. I must admit I had not given much thought to this issue prior to the visit by these experts \u2013 at least I had not really looked at it as an issue.\n\nSo when Simon asked how many of us had filled in the attendance sheet at the door, providing our names, designations, name of organizations, email addresses and cell numbers, all of us raised our hands. His next question was \u201cHow many of you bothered to ask us what we were going to do with this information?\u201d Of course none of us had. And this is where the problem starts.\n\nWhether we fill out an application form for a passport, an ID card, a visa, a credit card or whether we fill in a registration form for a workshop or for a free download from a website, we never ask WHAT any of those people are going to do with the information they are collecting. We don\u2019t even know how many people will have access to the information, or if they are in fact going to sell it to a marketing organization. Have you ever wondered about the number of marketing calls you get on your mobile? Or the mass mailings you receive on your email account? Where do you think those people get hold of your contact information? All this personal information is open to misuse and in many countries there are no laws to protect us against this misuse.\n\nWhen you look at social networking sites like Facebook or mySpace or even photo/video sharing sites like Flickr or youTube, you begin to see that we are all sharing a lot of information that can be misused. I believe Flickr actually says that any photo you upload no longer belongs to you and can be used for any purpose. Scary to say the least.\n\nAnd what about information collected by the National Health Service in the UK or NADRA in Pakistan? How many people have access to it? What do they do with it? What if it is lost? Yes NHS lost millions of records recently. That must have included health information about adults and kids that is now somewhere out there.\n\nWith smart cards becoming the norm in countries around the world, is it not our responsibility to advocate for privacy legislation and to start building in the right Privacy safeguards into technology products/websites/registration procedures etc so that we know that any information that is collected is used to a limited extent, for the purpose for which it was meant, and that it will be retained for a limited amount of time after which it will be destroyed. Shouldn\u2019t we during this period have access to the data so that we can ensure its continued accuracy?\n\nIn subsequent posts I will talk about actual cases of misuse of data \u2013 deliberate and through pure negligence \u2013 which have resulted in causing grievous harm to the rights of individuals.\n\nA friend of mine has put up as associated post on Privacy that I thought I would share here.

Whether it be a sabzi walla, a rickshaw driver, a rural village woman, an executive in an organization, a politician or a businessman, most people can afford to buy a new or used mobile phone of one sort or another. Possessing a mobile phone gives them access to easy communication and hence, to some extent, this technology has proven to be a great equalizer.\n\nMaybe I am being too simplistic but it warms my heart to see such mass usage of a relatively new technology. Innovative use of it, as has been seen in the Grameen model, can also lead to economic empowerment.\n\nHowever, there are some dangers associated with a mobile phone that really have nothing to do with the technology itself. How many times have you seen people talking on their mobile phones while driving? It doesn\u2019t matter what they are driving \u2013 could be a car, a bike, a rickshaw, a donkey cart, a scooter or a bus. This is the cause of many accidents on our roads today. If you need to be connected, why not get a headset or a speaker phone attachment so that your hands can be used to control the vehicle you are driving.\n\nAs if this isn\u2019t bad enough, some people actually read and send text messages while driving. Imagine your eyes being off the road, and your hand being off the steering controls, at the same time. Scary, isn\u2019t it? And yet how many of us have done it at one time or another?\n\nWhy not pull over to the side of the road if you really need to take a call or send a message. It is a lot safer.

It was truly an amazing atmosphere.\n\nWithout the sponsors none of this would have been possible so thank you BearingPoint and Rodney Rahman for coming to the fore and being the lead sponsor of the event nationally. The active BearingPoint team provided counseling, held a lucky draw every two hours, and offered tea, coffee and snacks through the day \u2026 not to mention offered jobs to the kids.\n\nPixSense was the other sponsor who was there with a large team \u2013 in the lead was our friend Adnan Agboatwalla who manned the booth with his colleagues and was an active member in the workshops, panel discussions and of course the SI event which was sponsored by PixSense.\n\nOur other sponsor Intel was there with a strong team too and a huge kiosk to spread the word regarding the Intel Youth Network. And last but not least we also had Microsoft as a sponsor.\n\nThe Ambassadors from Mohammad Ali Jinnah University and CBM, who were in the black P@SHA branded t-shirts, were all over the place, offered help to exhibitors and assisted wherever necessary. They were terrific and no amount of praise that we shower on them will be enough. They were really so motivated and handled everything to perfection.\n\nThe speakers & panelists were also out of this world. They presented, they shared, they answered every question with extreme patience and in as much detail as was required.\n\nThanks to Nauman Sheikh for running an amazing Resume Writing session. All of us learnt something from it, and the kids surrounded him for long afterwards asking him all sorts of questions that they couldn\u2019t ask during the session. He was available to them all day although I had to throw him and his adoring fans out after about an hour when the next session was about to start.\n\nThe second workshop was on Presentation Skills. I was the speaker and thought I was doing very well until Jawwad Farid and Adnan Agboatwalla walked in to heckle. Well i can be one smart cookie at times, so as soon as I saw them I asked them to join me on stage. Such brilliant presenters would indeed add value, I said. They are smarter still and threw the ball in the court of the audience asking them all sorts of questions. At this stage the session turned into a very interactive one. It got even better when Ashraf Kapadia and Adnan Lawai joined the panel. I must admit that it was a more valuable experience for the attendees than would have happened if I had been the only one presenting. Thanks guys!\n\nIf the panel thought they were now off the hook, they were wrong. The next session was what they had actually been invited for. It was on Choosing a Career \u2013 whether to join an MNC, a local startup or start your own venture.\n\nAshraf Kapadia, having put in 30 years at IBM, was asked to hold the fort for the MNCs while the rest of the panel was expected to push heavily for local companies or new ventures. The discussion was very balanced with the advantages and disadvantages of each being covered. Lots of interesting questions helped to make it an extremely stimulating experience for the panel as well as the attendees.\n\nThis was followed by the Startup Insiders session. Most of the participants stayed on for this although we had to throw them out for a while in order to change the setup of the room and make it more conducive for an SI session.\n\nThe theme was \u201cHow to develop a Business Plan\u201d. We had thought we would make it a hands-on session with young people bringing in their ideas to get help with the initial stages of the Plan. Unfortunately that didn\u2019t happen because it was a much larger number of people \u2013 a lot of them first-timers so we had to pretty much keep it a question-answer session. Not as much fun as previous Karachi sessions, but nonetheless a lot of useful points came through and loads of questions were answered. The panel from the previous session stayed and more members were added. So Hassan Basharat of Goodcore Software and Nauman Sheikh of Credit Chek (nope he didn\u2019t leave \u2013 he was on a high and just stayed on) joined the rest of the panel to field the many questions that were put to them. Some playacting (or role playing) also took place as can be seen from the picture below.\n\nA few of the regular SI attendees who wanted to discuss a Business Plan were asked to get in touch with us offline so that they could be given dedicated time. It\u2019s scary but some have actually left their jobs to start ventures. Are we sowing the seeds of entrepreneurship or are we just showing them the possibilities and letting them discover their true potential? Maybe a bit of both.\n\nWhat pleased many of us most was the participation from younger executives. They not only helped with the counseling efforts, they also ran the Special Interest Group sessions and helped fresh graduates with their CVs and I even made sure that some of them faced the cameras and spoke to the media. This kind of participation from them gives us all hope that we are indeed part of a growing and vibrant industry.\n\nAs usual, the Counseling sessions were a great hit and people like Dr. Zahir Syed, Azhar Rizvi, Jawwad Farid, Ashraf Kapadia, Adnan Agboatwalla, Arshad Khalil, Arif Irfanullah, Yusuf Jan, Sajid Hameed, Hassan Basharat and lots of others sat and chatted with the kids and helped them clear some of the confusion regarding their career\n\nIt would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the active role played by Rabia Garib and her team. They have become an integral part of our activities over the years and have actively promoted our successes and the issues facing us. Thank you Rabia and Salaina. It is great to have you on our side.\n\nThere were lots of people who helped to make this event a success and my thanks go out to all of them. Official thank you letters will be sent out but this appreciation comes from the heart.\n\nMore photos and videos are available on netxpress.com.pk.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "An exhilarating day"},

More than 20 companies participated in the Career Expo, which focused on job offerings to students of the related sectors and the delegates briefed attendees about their companies, job trends and future prospects. Among the exhibitors were P@SHA, PixSense, IBM, Avanza Solutions, Etilize, Intel Pakistan, BearingPoint, Online Corporation, TLS, TPS, Server4Sale, Alchemy, TRG, MIXIT and several others.\n\nJehan Ara, President of P@SHA and Jawwad Farid of Alchemy spoke to a large number of students and enlightened their visions by sorting out different strategies of careers, jobs, employment as well as managing a business plan. There were several other topics that were discussed and this entire event was very helpful for youngsters.\n\nThe exhibitors received raving response in the form of resumes while students were pleased to have attended such a promising expo. Many described this event a critical platform that fills the empty spaces between youth and the professional industries. After noticing the positive effects of the career counseling, the fact was highlighted once again that every college and university of Pakistan needs a career-counseling department. This Career Expo series will repeat in Lahore and Islamabad, which will definitely be beneficial for the Pakistan\u2019s future.\n\nThe place was crowded with attendees and the exhibitors, which showed how successful this event, but you shouldn\u2019t make the judgment on quantity, rather make it on the quality of the interaction \u2013 which was great! The exhibition section contained a large number of IT and HR exhibitors, providing the students with an easy platform, which led right into the proper jobs. Moreover, the career counselors dealt with hundreds of students solved their complications and guided them to their required and deserved careers.\n\nIt is only when all this happens that you know that perhaps to a small degree you have been successful in what you attempted to do.

They offered a reward for the first person to collect and submit the UK Prime Minister\u2019s and Home Secretary\u2019s fingerprints. This was done to raise the awareness amongst politicians of the dangers of collecting this type of biometric data. The Privacy International blog explains the campaign in these words:\n\nAround the world, politicians are now calling for the mass fingerprinting of foreigners. The UK is relatively unique in that the Government is calling for the collection of all ten fingerprints of all citizens and residents and placing them into a single centralised database for wide access by police, and other government agencies. The Government is clear that it wants to treat all citizens as though they are criminals, having promised the police that they can trawl through the fingerprint database for forensic purposes.\n\nFollowing recent data breach scandals, including the loss of 25 million records on British families, we are not confident in the ability of the Government to secure this information. In fact, even the Government\u2019s advisors, including the recent report for HM Treasury by Sir James Crosby argues against the collection of unique biometrics; but the Home Office insists that it will continue along this hazardous path. As fingerprinting systems expand to enable people to secure their computers, possessions and even homes, the centralisation of biometrics will increase the risks of breaches.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Wanted for Conspiracy and Identity\u00a0Theft!"},

As we edged forward at a snail\u2019s pace, and I got closer to where the blockage appeared to be, I noticed that there was a 5-car pileup in the lane to the extreme right. The reason why the rest of the traffic was held up was because all the cars in the adjacent lanes slowed down to see if they could get a glimpse of what had happened. It was this curiosity that was responsible for the huge traffic jams.\n\nThis morning I noticed it again on my way to work. There was an accident involving two motorbikes that shouldn\u2019t really have impacted too much on the rest of the traffic but it did because everyone who passed by in all parallel lanes slowed down to see what was going on.\n\nAre we really that short on entertainment that scenes like car pileups or accidents are of so much interest to us that we are willing to cause a holdup of traffic just so we can get a quick glimpse?

In the past graduates were told to go straight into multinational companies or banks where they would earn good money and have a future. With IT companies matching the salary scales and providing challenging and interesting environments, the exodus from multinationals and banks to IT companies has begun. Kids are finding that they have a good career growth to look forward to when they join a local IT firm. Continuous learning, challenging projects and smart colleagues, friends and mentors are part of the scene. A friend recently told me that in 2004 a FAST graduate came aboard at Rs. 12000; this rose to Rs. 13000 in 2005, Rs. 18000 in 2006 and 22000 in 2007. This month the going rate is around Rs. 30000.\n\nAnd we are not even looking at the middle management and senior management scales which are significantly higher. P@SHA is conducting a salary survey to determine what the different salary segments are and where they are headed. Whereas fair compensation needs to be paid to bright individuals, we need to ensure that the salary increases don\u2019t hit the roof and are sustainable. Some companies are actually offering incentives in the form of visas and jobs in the Middle East, the US and Canada for those kids who want to explore other pastures.\n\nCompanies have also started investing in offices \u2013 some have constructed their own campuses \u2013 like Netsol Technologies, Autosoft Dynamics and Alchemy. Others have taken entire buildings on rent \u2013 like Systems Ltd, Abacus Consulting, Folio 3, Softech Systems, Infotech and Etilize. Yet others have taken up thousands of square feet in new buildings \u2013 like PixSense, Mixit, TRG, Inov8 and Si3 \u2013 or in STPs \u2013 like LMKR, Ovex, Ikonami and others.\n\nIt makes my heart glad to see companies growing and maturing and creating environments that are good for business yet providing areas of entertainment and relaxation for teams who work long hours and need to chill out from time to time. So for those who are cynical about this industry, I say to you \u201cLook around \u2026 you will be surprised.\u201d", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The industry is growing\u00a0up"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/06/27/meet-mohammad-hanif-author-of-exploding-mangoes/", "text": "What\u2019s the story of the 3 covers, Mohammad Hanif was asked, at a \u2018breathing-space-only\u2019 reading of his book \u201cA Case of Exploding Mangoes\u201d at The Second Floor on Sunday. He confessed that he had provided little input on the covers \u2013 it was mostly the publishers decision.\n\nHis personal preference is the one in the middle which is the one published in Europe (I thought that one was the most creative one too). The Americans are too literal, he said, with the dynamite sticking out of the mango. And of course the Indian publisher decided that Zia ul Haq\u2019s face would get recognition in South Asia so we are tortured with the cover on the extreme left!\n\nMohammed Hanif was born in Okara, Pakistan. He graduated from the Pakistan Air Force Academy as a Pilot Officer but subsequently left to pursue a career in journalism. He has worked for Newsline, India Today and The Washington Post. He has written plays for the stage and the critically acclaimed BBC drama, What Now, Now That We Are Dead? His feature film, The Long Night has been shown at film festivals around the world. He is a graduate of University of East Anglia\u2019s creative writing programme. Mohammad Hanif is currently head of BBC\u2019s Urdu Service and lives in London. That is the official intro from the T2F website. Now for my impressions.\n\nA pleasant, witty, down-to-earth, no-airs individual who seems a little taken aback and embarrassed at all the compliments and the glory being showered on him. He didn\u2019t try to make the book into anything it wasn\u2019t. There was no mystery surrounding it, no bigger mission, no courage involved. He wanted to write a Murder mystery, said he was too lazy to come up with an original plot, so he decided to pick up on the fated crash of the Hercules C130 but since he had no luck getting any facts from any quarters, he decided to turn it into a fictional piece of work. The only fact in the book is the plane crash. The rest is all the product of his imagination. That was the simple explanation the author gave for having written the book. No hidden agenda, no hatred of the army, no revealing of secrets that became known to him through Deep Throat or anything like that.\n\nIt took him two years to write the book, he said and it was not that difficult because we are so good at conspiracy theories in Pakistan. I picked up stuff from friends and acquaintances and from my own personal experiences, and then exaggerated them a bit, he said.\n\nWhy did you write the book in English, he was asked, to which he answered \u201cWell I don\u2019t know really. I had always thought when I became a journalist that one day I would write an Urdu play, an English novel and I would make a Punjabi film. So I guess it was a translation of that dream.\u201d\n\nWhy did you make Zia ul Haq\u2019s wife so interesting, asked one young man, when we are told that in reality she was quite a boring character. To this his response was, \u201cWell, by this time Zia was too paranoid to leave Army House much so the book is set mostly within the parameters of his residence. If she hadn\u2019t been interesting, then the book would have been quite boring.\u201d\n\nHave you received any threats from Zia\u2019s family, the Army or the Intelligence Services he was asked. \u201cNo,\u201d said Hanif. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are into reading books.\u201d :-)\n\nHanif read parts of the book out loud that evening, answered all the questions put to him, in very good humour, even the most stupid ones. He signed everyone\u2019s copy of the book and paid tribute to colleagues and mentors from the Pakistan Journalism scene \u2013 people like Razia Bhatti and Rehana Hakim who had given him the opportunity to work in Herald Magazine when he was but a kid with little knowhow of journalism. He was modest throughout and said hello to many in the audience whom he had known personally through his early career in Karachi \u2013 people like Babar Ayaz, Beena Sarwar and Sahar Ali who were all there, as were Ardeshir Cowasjee and Abbas Hussain, a long time colleague of Hanif\u2019s from BBC Urdu.\n\nIf people were expecting Hanif to provide them with a formula for becoming a successful novelist, they didn\u2019t get any. He said he didn\u2019t follow any discipline, scribbled most of what he wrote in a notepad before finally typing it out.\n\nWhat was his experience with the Editor? Was it a close relationship? Did it involve a lot of to-and-fro of chapters from him to the editor and back. Nope, he said, \u201cactually I only met him once for a few hours. Other than fixing all the punctuations which I really mess up quite badly, he didn\u2019t really make or suggest any changes. I was lucky I guess.\u201d\n\nNice guy, brilliant author, modest human being. I hope he continues to write. We could do with a lot more wit in our lives. Good luck Hanif. We await the next book.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Meet Mohammad Hanif \u2013 author of Exploding\u00a0Mangoes"},

He said that art and sculpture appeared to live in art galleries and museums or in private households and is not visible to the public. They are not exposed to it and cannot begin to learn to appreciate it or let it impact on their lives.\n\nI often think as I drive through Karachi why we haven\u2019t used our collective artistic talent to beautify our environment. Whether it is our roundabouts or other public places, art is rarely used. Why is that? In other countries art is everywhere \u2013 benches at airports, shopping malls, bus and train stations, major intersections across cities.\n\nIn Karachi, we have sponsors like Reliance\u00a0 Paints and Zong taking up wall space along some major flyovers and what do they use the space for? Nothing. It is just their logos splashed all over. Come on guys! Can we be more creative? Yes get your mileage from the advertising dollar you are spending but make the flyover a pleasure to drive over. How? Simple. Have art students from Indus Valley School of Art and Karachi School of Art produce a creative project that will not only be colourful but will be food for the soul. They can still say something like \u201cThis mural is brought to you courtesy of XYZ company.\u201d I am sure their customers will think more highly of them for having contributed to the beautification of the city.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Can we use art to bring some beauty into our\u00a0lives?"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/06/21/a-potentially-interesting-evening-turns-sour/", "text": "It all started when I phoned Sabeen to wish her Happy Birthday and asked her where she was going to be in the evening. That is when she told me that Geo was recording a panel interview of Sabiha Sumar regarding her latest documentary Dinner with the President.\n\nFor those who have not heard of Sabiha, here is a brief intro of her from the Vidhi Films (a company that Sabiha set up with S Sathananthan) website:\n\nBorn in Karachi, Sabiha Sumar studied Filmmaking and Political Science at Sarah Lawrence College in New York from 1980 to 1983 and then read History and Political Thought at Cambridge University.\n\nAs a independent filmmaker Sabiha Sumar has earned much acclaim for her films which deal with political and social issues such as the effects of religious fundamentalism on society and especially on women. Her first feature film, \u2018Silent Waters ( Khamosh Pani )\u2019 has played in film festivals around the world. Silent Waters won the Golden Leopard award at the Locarno International Film Festival in 2003. Sabiha\u2019s first documentary, \u2018Who Will Cast the First Stone,\u2019 about three women in prison in Pakistan under Islamic law won the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco Film Festival in 1998.\n\nHer latest documentary \u201cDinner with the President\u201d is said to be her personal search for Democracy in Pakistan. The documentary has raised a lot of eyebrows amongst Pakistanis and non-Pakistanis alike \u2013 with many saying that this award-winning film is extremely flawed and biased, that she has not included interviews with major political parties, but what is considered most horrifying is Sabiha\u2019s conclusion that democracy is perhaps a culture that may not work in Pakistan.\n\nSo the panel interview at The Second Floor sounded like it would be interesting and juicy, to say the least. Since they had said they were going to lock up T2F from 5:15 pm to 6:15 pm for the recording, I got there just before that.\n\nSo did I enjoy the evening? Sadly, only a part of it. Had a chance to chat with some bloggers who were there while we waited \u2026 and waited \u2026 and waited. I find it very irritating that people do not value time and so I could feel myself becoming less relaxed as the time wore on.\n\nFinally at 7 it seemed the Geo team was finally ready.\n\nWhen they asked us to turn off our mobile phones, everyone naturally cooperated.\n\n When they asked that the doors be locked and no-one be allowed in or out during the recording, that made sense.\n\n When they asked that the kitchen be closed \u2013 no noise of coffee being brewed or milkshakes being made, it was a reasonable request.\n\n Even when some \u201cpompous\u201d guy gave a long spiel about how we had to be quiet during the recording because the equipment was very sensitive and would pick up the slightest sound (he took 5 minutes to say this \u2026 he just went on and on), we accepted it with a reasonable amount of patience.\n\nWhen did the patience run out? Well, it started when they told us not to cough although they insisted on smoking in a closed space. They told us to be absolutely quiet, no whispering. I was surprised they didn\u2019t say \u201cdon\u2019t smile otherwise the change of expression will be picked up by our mikes\u201d. It actually got worse when they told us not to sip coffee \u2013 not as if we were slurping or anything. Perhaps we should stop breathing too, was the thought that came to mind.\n\nCan you imagine they told one of the young men to stop playing chess because he might get excited, jump up, and cheer at some stage of the game. I wonder if they wanted to record in a real coffee house or in a wax museum. Anyway, when they told us not to have coffee, we considered it blasphemous and staged a walkout. :-) Perhaps they should take themselves less seriously.

Techlogix, Sofizar, Alchemy, VahZay, Amaana, Si3, Lootmaar, Trivor, PixSense, Folio3 and Ikonami are to mention a few. This is not to belittle our own home-grown talent who are daily coming out with innovative young start-ups that are proving to the world that innovation is alive and well in Pakistan.\n\nThese bright young people are full of enthusiasm and are developing in their companies a professional ethic and process that is second to none.\n\nI met one such CEO on my recent visit to Lahore \u2013 Hasnain Sheikh of Inov8 whom I had met briefly at the Mobile Commerce Conference in Karachi a couple of months ago. A graduate of Wharton Business School, Hasnain exudes a confidence that is infectious. He talked about the Mobile Banking space and how much his young company has achieved within a short space of time.\n\nInov8 is different from Amaana in that they are not focusing on branchless banking or providing an option to those who are outside the banking system. They are instead working with banks and providing value added services for the existing customers of these banks. They are also working with telcos, insurance companies and utility firms to offer CRM services, content delivery services and transaction processing services via the mobile phone. Although they are already operational, the official launch is likely to take place in about a month\u2019s time.\n\nWalking through their offices and listening to the vision that Hasnain and Bashir have for the company, and seeing what the young team of 60 that they already have in place are alreaady delivering from their spiffy offices in Mall Road, once again showed me that a lot more was happening in the IT space in this country that a lot of people give us credit for, and that there was every reason to be optimistic about the future of technology growth in Pakistan.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Terrific to see such enthusiasm and\u00a0commitment"},

This one disturbed me the most.\n\nOver the years, I remember telling a number of people off for holding infants in one arm while they held a cigarette in the other hand. Did they know much harm they were causing to those sensitive tender lungs, I asked them? Then there are those who smoke indoors without any concern for the health of other people in the room.\n\nI am allergic to cigarette smoke \u2013 my throat swells and within a few hours of exposure to smoke, I start wheezing and at times actually stop breathing. Although some smokers respect my wishes and go outside to smoke, others just laugh and say they will blow the smoke in another direction. Is this because these people are inconsiderate, or is it simply that they do not understand (or do not want to understand) how much harm they are causing?\n\nBut this is not about me. It is about all of us and what we are doing to stop tobacco from ruining the health of people young and old across the world. Authorities here have followed regulations and put up No Smoking signs at airports. Restaurants have also segregated smokers from non-smokers to some extent although there are many who haven\u2019t because it will hurt business. Yet, wherever there are signs, implementation is weak. I cannot count the number of times I have seen people waiting for their baggage at airports, standing below a No Smoking sign, lighting up. Airport authorities do not tell them to refrain. I am quite well known for going over to such people and pointing out the No Smoking sign to them. Sometimes they are embarrassed enough to put the cigarette out but very often they just shrug and carry on.\n\nSome smokers I know are very nice people. Yet this habit (yes that is what it is!) makes them behave against their otherwise better nature. So what is it about tobacco addiction that makes people inconsiderate? Or is it that they have just closed their minds to the harm they are causing themselves and their families and friends?\n\nThe growing number of young people who are taking to smoking because they think it is glamorous, is alarming. Some girls/women smoke because they think it is a sign that they are liberated. I don\u2019t want to offend anyone but as far as I am concerned, it is a sign of sheer stupidity. If smokers could see what smoking does to their lungs and what passive smoking does to others, I am sure there are many of them who would put out their cigarettes today. So how do we convince them? How do we change the habits of these people one person at a time?\n\nAnd no, this is not just about Pakistan. Recently I was in a Food Court in KL where people were sitting below a No Smoking sign and smoking \u2013 similar experiences in Hong Kong, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. When will we get past this? How do we start educating people so that they won\u2019t have to be fined or told that they should put out a cigarette in public places?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "There is something very wrong when you see photos like\u00a0this"},

The Kenko Reflexology & Fish Spa at the Pavilion Shopping Mall in Kuala Lumpur offers this \u201cspa experience like no other\u201d with prices starting at RM30 (Rs. 600).\n\nI learnt about this unique spa during a break in the ASOCIO Executive Directors meeting which we were trying to conduct over dinner hosted by PIKOM (the Malaysian IT Association). Since this was at the tail end of a very hectic week, most of the participants were in a party mood and a karaoke session was taking place in parallel which of course didn\u2019t help reduce the noise levels.\n\nAnyway, one of our Malaysian friends, when asked how one would spend a spare hour or so in KL, told us about a Fish Spa not far from the hotel where most of us were staying. Yup a Fish Spa! Great for therapeudic purposes, we were told. These are not your normal fish you understand. They are toothless so no need to fear them really. Yeah right!!!\n\nThe fish are called Garra Rufa and have apparently originated from a hot spring near Kangal in Turkey where they were first discovered for their healing power. Not surprisingly, some people call them \u2018Doctor Fish\u2019 as it is claimed that they help in easing the symptoms of those suffering from various skin conditions. As you can see in this picture, they nibble away your scaly and dead skin, leaving your feet smooth and glowing.\n\nBelieve me I was tempted to try it considering that I really needed a pedicure but somehow the thought of little fish nibbling away at my feet, was not a very attractive thought. The fact that they have no teeth did not really offer me comfort. However, for those who are less squeamish and ticklish, I am told it is worth a try. By the way, these fish are quite picky from what I hear. They are more attracted to older, scalier, skin, and so fewer circulate around children\u2019s feet.

He was on a panel termed \u201cThe Great Debate\u201d and some of the subjects discussed included privacy, cyber security, cyber terrorism (or cyber threat which was what they preferred to term it), the all-pervasiveness of technology, energy and environmental issues, the digital divide, etc etc. It was so wonderful listening to him.\n\nAnswering a question as to why it was that all great ideas (like Google, YouTube, the iPod, etc) had all come out of Silicon Valley and there wasn\u2019t one that had come out of Asia, Dr. Gage said we should look at the people who had been behind these ideas, and not the country \u2013 there were Asians who had always been part of the core teams. It is just that the Silicon Valley presented them with the opportunities, the environment and the nurturing that was needed for this to happen. The US Government had put oodles of money into Research initiatives at Stanford, MIT and Harvard over a number of years and had invested in education for years and years before it began to bear fruit.\n\nI must try and write down everything that the panel discussed but for now I am so excited that I actually met John Gage. Yup as the debate ended and they tried to rush him away, I slipped backstage and introduced myself \u2013 being small has its advantages :-). You know what amazes me about people like John Gage is that they are so approachable, so down-to-earth, so happy to talk, totally not full of themselves. When he heard that I was from Pakistan, and the kind of exciting things we were trying to make happen, he said he really wanted to do something in Pakistan and we should talk. He gave me his card and told me to start an email dialogue with him so that we could discuss this further.

The ACCS speaker also moaned and groaned about the sale of second hand computer games saying that it should be stopped because it impacts on the gaming industry and developers of games! I asked how this was different from the sale of second-hand books, clothes, bags, software, etc. Hadn\u2019t there always been a separate market for second hand products?

Then he advised me to remove the baggage sticker from the boarding pass and keep it safe somewhere else because i would need it when i landed in KL. He even asked me to have a safe and pleasant journey.\n\n3. The check-in team gave me the seat i wanted right in the front of the plane\n\nTHE BAD \u2013 easily fixed if they had the will to do it\n\n\n\n1. The immigration queues were long and slow moving. Why don\u2019t they get tech-savvy young people to man/woman these computers? Of course, as usual, the queue that is marked \u201cFor Unaccompanied women and children\u201d was full of young and middle aged men. They can\u2019t read I guess and no-one asked them to move. Why put up signs like these if they are not going to be adhered to? It\u2019s really irritating.\n\n2. The departure gate was changed at the last minute and no announcement was made until much later after we had gone from one gate to another when the flight departure was announced.\n\n3. The smoking that continues in the departure lounge despite large signs that clearly state \u201cNo Smoking\u201d.\n\n4. If you have an electronic ticket, you are sent to make a photocopy of it for the check-in staff for their records <sigh>\n\n5. The facilitation charge (meaning trolley charge and porter) is now Rs. 200 (up from Rs. 100). I wonder if it has gone up from Rs. 50 to Rs. 100 at the domestic terminals.\n\nThose are the immediate raves and rants. I am sure I will think of more later :-).", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Flying out of\u00a0Karachi"},

It is therefore possible that some of you may think I am being over-critical with this post. I usually try not to judge but I am just so cheesed off about this, that I need to get it off my chest.\n\nI went to an IT event in Karachi earlier this month \u2013 was really looking forward to it because events like these are always a great opportunity to meet up with some people who may not be part of one\u2019s usual network. I am not going to mention the name of the organization that hosted the event because the purpose is not to criticize but to try and understand why things like this happen. Is it just that no thought goes into the planning?\n\nThe evening started off well. The hosts were welcoming, the ambience was nice. It was outdoors and it was a pleasant Karachi evening. Met a number of old friends and associates whom I was able to chit-chat with before the beginning of the proceedings.\n\nIt was at this stage that things started to go southward. Two lovely young ladies were MC\u2019ing the event. Their idea of humour was to show how totally non-tech they were, how technology was something that went way above their aheads \u2013 our versions of the \u2018dumb blondes\u2019. The sad thing is that both the young ladies are actually quite bright and I know that at least one of them is tech-savvy. So why did they feel the necessity to be-little themselves and their gender? Is that really funny? Well, people laughed so I guess they thought it was. I was seething because we spend so much time convincing parents and young women/girls that there is no reason they cannot choose any profession that interests them \u2013 whether it be design, engineering, computer science, architecture, film, you name it. When women portray themselves as less intelligent and totally flaky, they do all of us a disservice and it annoys the hell out of me.\n\nAs if this was not bad enough, the evening actually got worse when a comedy troupe came on stage and cracked the most vulgar, crude and annoyingly un-funny jokes that I have heard in a long time. Risque humour can be funny but these jokes were not risque \u2013 they were blatantly crude, not amusing and totally unsuitable for the type of mixed audience and familes that were there. I actually squirmed and kept my eyes focused on the ground when some of the worst ones were uttered. I was sitting with colleagues and friends \u2013 some of whom had their spouses with them. There were kids from universities present.\n\nApart from the filthy, gutter humour that belonged in a boys\u2019 public school, there was a joke about suicide bombers with one chap coming on stage with dynamite strapped around him threatening to blow himself and everyone else up because life in Pakistan was not worth living. The punch line was that the device didn\u2019t explode because it was cheap Chinese technology. I found it all quite sickening I am afraid and was quite glad that the host was busy when I slipped out. I would not have been able to compliment him on a delightful evening.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why people believe that crudeness, violence and vulgarity is funny. Or am I simply being a prude?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "What is funny \u2026 what is\u00a0not"},

Are we sayng that that person is less than us in some way? Are we feeling sorry for him/her? Patting ourselves on the back for our compassion and sense of humanity if we take the time to hang out with someone whom we have labeled as disabled?\n\nHow do we define a disability? Isn\u2019t it merely the absence of an ability? Aren\u2019t all of us then disabled in one way or another? For instance, if I were living in Japan and was unable to speak Japanese, would I not be disabled from communicating effectively with the majority of the people living there? What if I found myself in the midst of a group of financial experts who were discussing some complicated financial issue that went over my head, wouldn\u2019t I be disabled from understanding the context of that discussion?\n\nRecently I met a young woman by the name of Lozina in Rawalpindi. She is confined to a wheelchair and, for her, pain and discomfort are synonymous with living. But chatting with her was an amazing experience. She has done her Masters in Computer Science and is at the moment working on a PhD. She has been physically challenged since she was born. Her parents decided at the outset that her condition would not be allowed to restrict her from doing anything that she wanted to do in life. I met the parents too and never have I met a couple who are as proud of their daughter, of the person she is and of her achievements. It was wonderful to see. The next step she is taking is to start on her PhD program and I must commend Dr. Arshad Ali and his team at NUST for encouraging her and providing her with whatever direction she needs to pursue this program. Vickram Crishna and his partner Dr. Arun Mehta have been asked to be her supervisors alongwith two NUST professors.\n\nMeeting with Lozina reminded me of a person I met in Ahmedabad years ago. I had been invited to be a panelist at a conference there. Walking into the workshop area, I saw a gentleman sitting and working on his laptop, headset on, talking on his mobile while he was typing away \u2013 a really hi-tech dude. He was the moderator of the session \u2013 Dr. Dipender Manocha. A terrific guy, great sense of humour, very knowledgeable about a diverse number of subjects. I sat and chatted with him for about half an hour before I realized that he could not see. Dipender has since been to Pakistan several times. We (P@SHA and Rotary) have organized seminars for him and he has assisted six institutes to form the DAISY for Pakistan platform in Pakistan. These institutes have been given equipment and training and have now started converting books into DAISY format thus making books much more accessible to those with visual challenges. The Holy Quran and some\u00a0 books from the school curriculum have already been converted.\n\nI remember something that Dipender told me when we first met. He said those who can see will never know what it\u2019s like to always have everything read to you, to never be able to \u2018read\u2019 and send email, to pick up any book one wants to and \u2018read\u2019 it. He said when he first discovered technology, it empowered him to be who he was, to communicate and share what he knew and to simply have the pleasure of \u2018reading\u2019 a book at his own pace.\n\nIt is experiences like these that make me wonder why we think of people like Lozina and Dipender as \u2018disabled\u2019 and why we do not spend more time developing technology to empower the broader segments of society \u2013 or as my friends Vickram and Arun often say, why do we not work with people with various challenges so that they can develop the technology they need to make life better for themselves? That was what led to the workshop on Intelligent Choices. More about that later.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Perceptions can change if you open up your\u00a0mind"},

I drove early in the morning to the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi for an event that was being held at the Pearl Continental. As soon as I had handed over my car to the valet and walked into the lobby, I realized my mistake and headed straight for the exit. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking but I sure woke up with a bang when I walked straight into the glass door.\n\nI was too embarrassed to think about the extent of the injury and hurried off across the street to the PC so that I would not be late for the session. By this time the lump on my forehead had increased in size and was hurting quite a bit. Zahid Jamil was one of the speakers for the session and he immediately got one of the hotel staff to get some ice-cubes in a napkin. That certainly helped ease the swelling. The pain still persists but the worst is over.

This is the second time that an SI session has been held at an Academic institution. The last one was SI # 6 at LUMS in Lahore. The NIIT team, headed by Dr. Arshad Ali, did a fantastic job of making all the arrangements.\n\nThere had been some pre-event jitters with a few people wondering whether holding it at a university would dilute the purpose of SI. I really wish the negativity would cease. We need to be realistic but upbeat nonetheless. SI is just a name. The purpose is to provide a networking platform for the support, mentoring and coaching of young entrepreneurs and wanna-be entrepreneurs. This was missing and the gap needed to be filled. People got together. It is the collaboration, the selfless giving up of time on the part of busy entrepreneurs, to help build an ecosystem, that is making these events successful, in addition to the young people themselves who are the key.\n\nThey are the ones with the passion, with the innovative ideas, with the zest to move ahead and change the world. We are only the guides, the sounding boards who may or may not always have the right answers but whose intent is to be there for them and provide whatever it is of value that they need from us.\n\nThere have been suggestions that perhaps it would make sense to split up these events into SI and SI Junior because the needs and requirements of the two segments does vary. This is worth thinking about and we would appreciate everyone\u2019s input on this.\n\nNow back to SI 8. A roomful of maybe 75 participants \u2013 mostly students, some young alumni and a dozen or so entrepreneurs \u2013 some startups, others more seasoned. As usual, the evening started off with introductions. It is always important to know who\u2019s who and what they do \u2013 to put a face to a name. Then there was a barrage of questions from the youngsters present. All the questions were answered honestly and openly.\n\nAtif and I then had a brief pow-wow and we decided, that as had been done in Karachi at SI # 7, we should split the kids up into smaller groups with one mentor each to thrash out ideas. Very quickly teams were formed and Rashid Khan of Ultimus, Amir Jahangir of CSF, Vickram Crishna of Radiophony, Atif Mumtaz of Brightspyre, Osama Hashmi of CDF Software, Adnan Shaukat of Capital Radio, Nadeem Sahab from the Jang Group/GEO CSR Initiative were surrounded by enthusiastic young people.\n\nWhen the representatives of each group came back, they were all raring to go. One after another they came up and shared their ideas and the input they had received. The audience, the entrepreneurs and the students fired questions, made suggestions, agreed or disagreed and discussed possible business models. There were even a couple of offers of \u201ccome and see me and we will assist you in making it happen.\u201d There were also suggested tie-ups between a couple of teams whose ideas appeared to have synergy. All in all, a real buzz was created.\n\nI have moderated most of the SI sessions in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad \u2013 and I must admit that I continue to be amazed and heartened, both at the contribution made in terms of time, thoughts, ideas and advice by entrepreneurs but also by the innovative ideas and the enthusiasm that the young people exude. The fact that some of these young people are also looking at using technology to provide solutions for social and operational problems, warms my heart.\n\nSI sessions will continue in all 3 cities and there is some thought that we should take them to other cities \u2013 Peshawar, Quetta, Multan, Sukkur. I look forward to continuing to work with various people and organizations on the SI initiative. There will be shortcomings, as there usually are when things are evolving. As long as all of us continue to do our bit, we can overcome all these challenges.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Meeting bright young people is always such a\u00a0pleasure"},

BBC published the most \u201csensational\u201d story (and Umar believes it is the best picture in popular media): I think the one taken by Jawwad at SI#6 was much nicer (the one above): http://www.pervasive-cmi.csail.mit.edu/news/3583479.stm.html\n\nUmar and his team started this work over 4 years ago, when they wrote the first position paper on what we dubbed goal-oriented programming. This paper laid out the early vision of a system that may be programmed with human intent, rather than complicated computer jargon. The system\n\n became the center piece of Project Oxygen at MIT ($45Million project) and became a progenitor of several follow on systems in this area.\n\nYou may download the following video to see the system (and Umar Saif) in action: http://cag.csail.mit.edu/~umar/tmpmovies/mov1.mpg\n\nOther noteworthy work done by Umar and his team in the area of research in the last 6 months include\n\n1. A project that got funding from Microsoft Research (Poor Man\u2019s\n\n broadband) was featured in New Scientist (a first for Pakistan).\n\n http://www.cag.csail.mit.edu/~umar/NS-PMB.pdf. This was also the first\n\n time a research project in Pakistan was funded by Microsoft Research\n\n (LUMS press release:\n\n http://web.lums.edu.pk/umar/press/microsoft.asp.html\n\n2. They just got a large collaborative research program funded in\n\n collaboration with UC Berkeley (by USAID/HEC). This research program\n\n is focused on Developing-world technologies and the work will be\n\n jointly carried out with Eric Brewer\u2019s TIER group at Berkeley\n\n (http://tier.cs.berkeley.edu). Our side will be led by my team at\n\n http://www.dritte.org and http://newt.lums.edu.pk \u2014 with\n\n participation by PTCL, VU, NADRA, PITB and DSD.\n\n3. They will be running a course with Univ. of Washington (Seattle, UW)\n\n on developing-world technologies in a week\u2019s time. The lectures will\n\n broadcast live on LUMS campus and Umar Saif will be guest lecturing in a\n\n couple of sessions via a video link. There will be other guest lecturers\n\n from MIT, CMU, Berkeley and Microsoft.

This has landed the country in a complete state of flux. As a result of the current political turmoil coupled with the energy crisis, no foreign investment is forthcoming. Despite these prevailing conditions of the country, there are still few committed individuals\u2019 who belief in their capabilities and stay focused towards achieving their goals.\n\nOne most proud example is of Farrukh Abbas, 25 years old Pakistani who co-founded Mobile Weaver at the age of 22, along with his two European companions Babar Baig and Umar Akram, with a promising hope of making it big one day. These three entrepreneurs started a small venture in 2005 by the name of Mobile Weaver based in Islamabad and Copenhagen.\n\nThe motivation behind the startup was based on a simple idea that connects the mobile developer community with the mobile consumers by uniting them on one platform. They started up by picking up the best selling applications and games from the world wide developers and selling them to consumers through a content delivery platform. In this whole process the developers were provided with the major share of the earnings. Some big names for developer partners include Spb Software House, Mobifusion, Sunny Soft, Beiks, Mobisystems, Shapes Services and many others. The company\u2019s flagship product, Youpark.com is an online storefront that provides users with an exclusive catalog of interesting mobile applications and games for platforms like Symbian, Windows Mobile (Smartphone and Pocket PC), Palm OS, Java as well as Blackberry. They offer latest mobile software and games for leading mobile manufacturers such as Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, Motorola, HTC and many more.\n\nIn a very short time the company has partnered with the leading mobile distributors such as Bright Point Inc and many clients in Italy, France, United Kingdom and Norway. Mobile Weaver provides solutions to these distributors, so that they can market and sell devices along with their device specific applications and games. Mobile industry in Pakistan is dominated with few big names of mobile distributors such as United Mobile and Mobile Zone. The main challenge for mobile distributors in Pakistan is to come closer to their customers by providing them value in their services. Mobile Weaver possesses the same endeavor of providing innovative solutions to the distributors of Pakistan so that they can offer consumer an easy access to exciting world of mobile content.\n\nPakistan is one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing cell-phone markets, with user numbers growing by 73% as compared to the last year. The country of 160 million currently has 67 million cellular subscribers. Consumer expectations are increasing and their loyalty to service providers is low. They want a lot more than beautiful ringtones on Valentine\u2019s Day or greeting messages on Eid day. This growing awareness in consumers has made them sophisticated enough to know where and how to find the right deal. With the rising maturity in content market, Pakistani people want value added services such as feature rich applications that can fulfill their needs whether they are business, travel, lifestyle or entertainment.\n\nAs the market shifts from technology-based to consumer-driven, it is essential for the Pakistani mobile players such as telcos and mobile distributors to squarely match the requirements of mobile consumers. To provide consumers with innovative and value added content is exactly the goal Mobile Weaver is pursuing. This objective can only be achieved by accepting the emergence of mobile content at the right time and responding to the increasingly changing demands of mobile consumers.\n\nSarah Shaukat is a qualified software engineer, presently working with a software house based in Islamabad. She\u2019s an experienced technical writer as well, and possesses in-depth knowledge of cellular industry specializing in the areas of mobile content and mobile application development.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Guest article from Sarah Shaukat of\u00a0YouPark.com"},

So when my brother sent me one as a gift, I was walking on air.\n\nI looked at it in its original packaging for a few days \u2013 didn\u2019t want to get fingerprints on it. Then when I finally did take it out and caress it, I did so tentatively. I still didn\u2019t go about trying to jailbreak it \u2013 yes it was locked.\n\nWhen I was sure I understood the process, I finally attempted to unlock my iPhone, and guess what? It turned into a brick! I was devastated! I tried everything including restoring the original software. Nothing worked. It kept telling me it was in \u201crecovery mode\u201d. Then, one fabulous day, with some online help, I was finally able to unlock my iPhone. Halaeluyah!\n\nSo what does all this have to do with Telenor? Well, I need a connection, don\u2019t I? So I went to Telenor to apply for a SmartMail account and I was told by the chap (nice though he was) that Telenor Smart Mail did not support the iPhone. The options he offered were:\n\n1. I could take the Plan that was only for browsing (no limit!) \u2013 this would not allow me to use the phone or mail option\n\n 2.

Since the iPhone is perfect for music and video, can you imagine what I would end up paying for such a connection?\n\nCome on Telenor! Be iPhone friendly! You already support Nokia, Ericcson and loads of other phones \u2013 why this bias against my iPhone? Let me have SmartMail which also allows for \u2018no-limit\u2019\u00a0 browsing and downloading.

However, we decided this time that there was no way we could miss SI#6. So we huddled into Imran Zia\u2019s Honda Civic with him at the wheel, and set off on our way from Islamabad to Lahore, early on Sunday morning while normal people slept in and began their day launguishing (a true sign of madness on our part i must admit).\n\nJawwad has already described the trip somewhat so I will not dwell any further on it. Actually I am trying with great difficulty to get over it ;)\n\nHardly had time to check into the PC and have a quick lunch before we headed in the direction of LUMS. Here is a snapshot of our enthusiastic group on our arrival at LUMS.\n\nMy friend Subroto Bagchi, co-Founder and COO of MindTree Consulting in Bangalore, writes in the Preface of his book The High Performance Entrepreneur:\n\nExactly what the entrepreneurs who have been panelists at the SI sessions have been trying to do! (SI enthusiasts may be interested in knowing that I have already convinced Subroto, during a recent visit to Mumbai, to speak at an SI session in Pakistan \u2013 maybe Jawwad and he could do a double act since they are both authors).\n\nSo what actually happened at LUMS? Various blogs have said it better than I could:\n\n http://blog.alchemya.com\n\n http://adilsaleem.blogspot.com \n\n http://lahore.metblogs.com\n\nWhat amazed me more than anything was the Management of LUMS who are often referred to as a very bureaucratic bunch. They were anything but that. Dr. Zahoor ul Hassan, the Vice Chancellor was warm and welcoming and made us feel right at home. Then he just sat back and let things take their course. No interference. No trying to steer the discussion in any particular direction. In the true spirit of the event, he let the young audience take control. Thank you Dr. Zahoor. We will be back.\n\nAnd as for Dr. Umar Saif, the combination of professor & entrepreneur \u2013 he was an absolute darling! I don\u2019t think I have ever seen him without a smile \u2013 except maybe in this picture where he seems to be in a contemplative mood \u2013 must be something FQ said!\n\nWith his experience as an entrepreneur, he added value to the discourse \u2013 although for most of the time he just sat back and listened, totally absorbed and maybe a little amused by our passion and excitement. Eh Umar? Thanks to him for volunteering the LUMS venue and working with Imran Zia on making it happen.\n\nZia is of course something else! He not only drove to Islamabad to be with us at SI#5 and the P@SHA CEO Lunch in Islamabad, he drove us, as Jawwad has reported, at the acceptable motorway speed limit, to Lahore AND much more important than anything else, he provided the Pizza Hut pizzas and soft drinks at the event. What a chap! Great guy to know. He is not as loud as the rest of us but his background is an impressive one \u2013 a graduate of Cornell University, seven years at Oracle in Silicon Valley, a failed venture in the Valley before he moved to Lahore to chill out and decided to stay and start VahZay. We are so glad he did. His new business is a roaring success, P@SHA is lucky to have him and we count him amongst our greatest supporters and fri ends. He also plays the role of UN Peacemaker whenever required. The best part of the event for me was meeting some of the people I had only known via blogs \u2013 Adil Saleem of 2\u2019s Complement, Hasan Mubarak from Lahore Metblogs, the team from Shophive.com and several young men and women who are comtemplating starting new ventures. M y fellow panelists \u2013 Zafar Khan of Sofizar, Jawwad Farid of Alchemy, Fahd Bangash of Amaana, Imran Zia of VahZay, Faisal Qureshi of Kolachi, Umar Saif of Bumpin\u2019 and ChOpaal, Imran Chishti of Alchemy and Nadeem Malik of Infotech (referred to as the marketing guru by Jawwad) \u2013 patiently answered all questions fired at them from different parts of the room. And surprisingly, they actually paid attention to the yellow cards which were used to steer us back onto the topic at hand whenever we started to waver. And, boy, did the kids use them! Empower a room full of young men and women and they go bonkers!\n\nFQ and Jawwad were brilliant as usual and more conversations took place during the refreshment break and after the event as groups of young people surrounded all of us to try and get specific input on issues, to get advice on the direction their businesses should take, or just to bounce off ideas.\n\nWe missed our regulars \u2013 Adnan Agboatwalla or PixSense, Osama Hashmi (our SI partner at Green&White), Mansoor Adenwalla of KMB and Ali Raza Sheikh (they have tried to be a part of multiple city events \u2013 next time Lahore is a must guys!)", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Startup Insiders Session # 6 in\u00a0Lahore"},

Some of the things that were discussed included the futility of any government blocking any website because there are always ways around getting to content if one really wants to.\n\nAnother point that came across was that the content isn\u2019t being pushed onto people. You have to go looking for it so if it is something that you don\u2019t like, or something that offends your religious, ethical or moral sensibilities, don\u2019t go looking for it.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/02/13/the-role-freelancers-play-in-the-growth-of-a-sector/", "text": "FREELANCING OUR WAY TO TECH LEADERSHIP\n\n says Kiruba Shankar\n\nI was recently talking with Rene Trescases, the founder of Scriptlance, one of the better known project bidding sites and he told me an interesting fact. India has the highest number of tech freelancers in the World\u2026. more than US, UK, Australia put together.\n\nSure, we all know about the domination the big Indian IT companies (Infosys, TCS, Wipro etc) have in the global marketplace. But not many realize that there\u2019s a very vibrant and successful freelance market and that we dominate this space as well.\n\nThe freelance world is a different world by itself. This is how it works. Many small businesses worldwide, who typically can\u2019t afford the rates charged by bigger companies, are on the lookout for individuals or small companies who charge less. They post their requirements on sites like RentACoder.com, eLance.com or Scriplance.com. It could be anything from a complex e-commerce shopping site to a logo design. Freelance Programmer from around the world then quote their rates for a particular project.\n\nThe business owner then gets to choose the freelance programmer based on their rates, testimonials from other clients and their previous projects. And this is the area that India dominates and how!\n\nForget the fact that the net value of the projects aren\u2019t big. Forget the fact that the main reason why the Indian freelancers get the projects is because they quote very competitive rates. The important thing is the entrepreneurial drive in them.\n\nMost people start off moonlighting. After coming back from their full time job, they work on projects in the evening. It\u2019s a healthy extra income. Some people talk about this as unethical which is why you never to get hear of many who moonlight. Some argue that what they do during their free-time is their prerogative. Whatever be the stand, there\u2019s no denying the fact that freelancing forms the seed for entrepreneurship.\n\nI have known many instances where people have quit full time work in software companies to pursue their own operations. Most start off with just a single computer with broadband connection in their bedroom.\n\nI have also seen such people grow. They eventually get more clients than they can handle on their own. To meet the demand, they expand their set up and hire more people. And therein lies the power of Entrepreneurship\u2026the power to generate jobs.\n\nWhen I spoke with Kanwal Rekhi , who many call the Father of Entrepreneurship, during the TiE Entrepreneurial Summit, I asked him why focus on entrepreneurship? He said, if India has to be successful and strong, then it should encourage wealth generation. And that\u2019s possible by creating more jobs. And who generates more jobs? Well, its the entrepreneurs, he says.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The role freelancers play in the growth of a\u00a0sector"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2008/02/10/it-feels-so-right/", "text": "Friday\u2019s Startup Insiders session at the Karachi Marriott was sponsored by Alchemy Technologies and it was exactly like that \u2013 full of energy, passion and loads of fun. Over a 100 young people got together wit h a handful of entrepreneurs from Karachi and Lahore to learn, to absorb new information, to network, to be a part of a growing, successful and innovative industry.\n\nSome of these young people are already bringing innovation and exciting new ideas to an industry that is at a stage where growth is in double and triple digits, where home-grown entrepreneurs, and those who have returned from the US, Australia and Canada, are taking their companies to much higher levels than was thought possible a few years ago hence creating and spreading an aura of success and excitement in the young people of this country.\n\n\u201cWe did it\u201d they all said yesterday \u201cand there is no reason you can\u2019t if you have the hunger, the passion and the perserverence.\u201d That was the key message. Humility filled the room as Faisal, Salim, Jawwad, Zia, Adnan and Amer shared their stories (Salim Ghauri and Imran Zia had flown in from Lahore for the event).\n\nAfter the introductions were out of the way and I had done my normal \u201cturn off your mobile phones otherwise I will take them \u2013 even though i now have an iPhone\u201d bit, the entertainment began. To my delight, Jawwad started the proceedings with the Apple 1984 video. Who was Apple addressing, what was the USP (Unique Selling Proposition), why did the ad work resulting in the creation of millions of Apple evangelists and users? This was followed by the FedEx, Lexus and VW ads. Lots of discussions ensued on the marketing idea behind all these ads, what was it that clicked or didn\u2019t, lessons learnt, etc. The ideas had started to flow, the minds were now engaged.\n\nAnd then \u2026\u2026. we broke for tea, coffee and snacks to let it all mull in. Several youngsters came up to us during the break to say that they wanted to be involved in all the SI sessions, some had delightfully weird ideas (note \u2013 weird is a compliment in my book) \u2013 all fresh, all absolutely amazing. We listened and will be discussing it on the SI platform and will be calling on some of you to help us implement these ideas.\n\nSee the picture above of my friend Adnan Agboatwalla? On Friday Adnan was playing the role of struggling young entrepreneur \u2013 unshaven, in denims, unpressed shirt, looking as if he hadn\u2019t slept for days \u2013 which could possibly be true since he has had one foot on a plane to Beijing, Barcelona, Dubai \u2026 and so on. More was revealed at SI4 regarding the PixSense story \u2013 from the plans on a napkin at Starbucks, to the setting up of the development arm here in Karachi, to the first sale.\n\nHow many of us have heard over the years that people fear making presentations more than they fear death? The truth of that came out when Adnan described how he had to present the first demo of the PixSense product in front of a large audience at a conference/exhibition \u2013 it was torture. \u201cI am not a presenter \u2026 I get nervous \u2026 I don\u2019t have the pizaz \u2026 and I don\u2019t like being in front of lots of people.\u201d And yet \u2026 when his presentation at the conference was followed up by a visionary Japanese chap talking about the future of mobile technology, and describing the PixSense product to the tee, PixSense got its first breakthrough.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, Salim Ghauri went to pitch to his first customer dressed in a suit and tie. The meeting was by the poolside of a luxury hotel with the customers dressed more appropriately in swimming trunks! Sweaty-palmed and anxious, young Salim (yes he was young once ;) ) presented Netsol\u2019s skillsets (at that time a team of 4) with a passion and keenness that struck paydirt. He got the business, delivered it on time, and has never looked back. He spoke about the importance of servicing a customer and ensuring that one under-commits and over-delivers so that repeat business and referrals take the company to the next stage. He knows what he is talking about guys and gals. Mercedes Benz now uses Netsol\u2019s award-winning Leasesoft product in 8 different countries.\n\nIf you have never met Amer Hashmi, you cannot imagine the passion and faith in Pakistan that one individual can exude. Having grown up in Toronto, Canada, this young man returned home to set up Si3, bringing back with him a few dozen expat Pakistani professionals. \u201cThere is amazing potential in this country,\u201d he said \u201cwe are at a stage in history where we can make Pakistan the next success story \u2026 if only we would believe it.\u201d\n\nWell, Amer believes it. He is on his way to making a world class company \u2013 developing professionalism and work ethic in young people not only in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad but also in Balochistan where Si3 is setting up a large data center. \u201cA small number of us cannot make this into the kind of industry that\u2019s needed \u2026 we need to join forces, to add on to the numbers, to collaborate and to create new companies and consolidate existing ones,\u201d said Amer.\n\n\u201cMy first start up in Silicon Valley failed,\u201d admitted Imran Zia. Why did it fail, he was asked. Yup, we were ruthless with the questions ;) He said it was timing. He started the company in late 2000 and then 9/11 happened and his company didn\u2019t have a chance.\n\nHe came to Pakistan thinking he would stay for 4 months, meet old friends, just unwind. While here, he got a call from a friend in the Valley asking if he could get some work done for him. \u201cI was lucky\u201d, he said. \u201cMy first contract literally fell in my lap\u201d. He got the work done, then something else came his way and before he knew it, he had started VahZay Pvt Ltd and the months turned into years and the business bloomed. \u201cI am still a small company\u201d, said Zia (who is also the Vice Chairman of P@SHA) \u2013 \u201cwe are about 20 people working out of an office in Lahore but we are doing well \u2013 it was the connections I made in the US, the people I knew who trusted my abilities and my professionalism who decided to send their work my way.\u201d\n\nSo can you only be successful if you have lived, studied and worked in the US or some other developed country and made contacts there? \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Jawwad Farid. \u201cAll the customers I have today are because of the connections I have in Pakistan through family, through friends, through people I went to school with in Pakistan. They recognize and trust me as an individual and us as a team.\u201d\n\nJawwad\u2019s wife and primary investor Fawzia interjected at this point. She told us a story about the early days of Alchemy. They had returned from the US after blowing a million dollars and owed close to US$30,000. They were at a customer meeting and really needed the work when \u2018angry\u2019 Jawwad asked the team to get up and leave the room. Anger management is an issue with Jawwad \u2013 he has spoken of it often. You know one thing though? It is the anger that generates the passion for the things he does. And I have never known him to be angry for no good reason.\n\nKnow when to walk away, was his message. Nothing is worth your dignity or that of your team\u2019s. There will always be other opportunities. And so there have been!\n\nI have personally always believed that nothing is worth losing your dignity over. I remember when I got a job in Hong Kong many years ago. It was a good offer and one I was really looking forward to but I was haunted by the first interview I had at the organization. The big boss, an Englishman \u2013 Adrian Batten \u2013 who later became a good friend, was throwing around 4-letter words \u2013 he was angry about something. I thought as I considered taking the job \u201cWould I be able to handle that kind of verbal attack? Did I even want to no matter how much money there was in it or how much opportunity it offered?\u201d I could have turned down the job. I didn\u2019t. However, at the final interview I told my soon-to-be employer \u201cThis is a new field of work for me. I am bound to make mistakes. When I do I want you to point them out and I will make sure I don\u2019t make the same mistake again, but please never raise your voice because the day you do, I will walk out and never come back. My dignity is all I have.\u201d He looked at me (a young, itsy bitsy girl with checkered experience) and said \u201cIs that an ultimatum young lady?\u201d I nodded, a little scared but not willing to back off. He smiled and said \u201cYou\u2019re on!\u201d I worked for him and with him for 9 years and we had a number of disagreements but NOT ONCE did he raise his voice.\n\nI think I started my entrepreneurial journey at that company because after a couple of years, Adrian lost interest and \u201cfound\u201d himself as those in the West often do. He went to a number of soul-searching sessions and then decided to set up a Spiritual Healing Centre in Bali with his Italian fiance. He made me the Managing Director and I ran the whole region from my base in Hong Kong. I made the money and he spent it but I loved running the show \u2013 all the pain, the stress, the uncertainty was well worth it at the end of the day. That is why I started ET with a friend when I came back to Karachi in the early nineties. I wanted to work for myself. I wanted to be responsible for my failure or my success, to create something that was uniquely mine, that I identified with. I guess that is what entrepreneurship is all about. But I digress \u2026.\n\nEveryone who was at SI4 must be wondering why I left out Faisal Qureshi. That is probably why he is glaring at me :) in this photo.\n\nI left Faisal Qureshi for last because I don\u2019t quite know what to make of the guy. He is funny, he is passionate, he has very strong beliefs. Some people adore him, others hate his guts but one thing\u2019s for sure, no-one can ignore him.\n\nFaisal is the Chairman of P@SHA this year. He also runs a tech shop by the name of Kolachi Advanced Technologies (actually Imran runs it, Faisal is just a visitor whose primary task is to come in every day, have coffee, fly to Singapore and Hong Kong to party with customers from time to time, hold their hands and make sure all is hunky dory). He is an activist of sorts, a media personality and a self-professed geek. He is also extremely passionate about Pakistan and is very vocal about what needs to be done to turn things around.\n\nFaisal made quite an impression at the first SI session and at the 4th one on Friday things were no different. He talked about many things. Ammar has put up some of the most interesting stuff on PakMarkaz.com. Thanks Ammar. Ali, we are waiting to see all your videos. We actually had the entire proceedings videoed and will be putting that up soon. Zia has also given me half of the SI3 proceedings on DVD. Will put that up too \u2026 eventually.\n\nBack to Faisal. He talked about many things \u2013 about the first customer he converted \u2013 someone who started off hating him but was won over because he stuck to his guns and did not comprise with his dignity. One thing about selling is, said Faisal, sell to a point and when you see that you are not getting through to the chap, leave. Come back to fight another day. As an example, he said even toddlers who are asking their moms for something, know within seconds by looking into their mothers\u2019 eyes whether they will get what they want. Read your customer, see if you are getting through, if not then head for the exit. Come back another time.\n\nUnfortunately Salim and I had to leave for CNBC at 9 pm (which is when this session was supposed to end). It carried on for another hour (there were still 4 or 5 young people there when I went back to pick up my car) and, you know something, although I was on the roof under the moon and stars recording a show on a beautiful set with Salim Ghauri and Asif Iqbal of Post Amazers, I was wishing that I was back at the Marriott in the highly charged atmosphere that we have all come to love.\n\nAll those techies and non-techies out to change the world \u2026 one pebble at a time. I feel lucky to have been part of SI1 and SI4 and have decided that there is no way I am going to miss any of these events no matter which city they are in.\n\nThank you Jawwad and Alchemy for hosting it. Thank you Faisal, Salim, Amer, Zia and Adnan for being there and sharing. But most of all thanks to all the young people (and the few old ones) who keep coming back and making these events such a joy for us all.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "It feels so\u00a0right!"},

Imagine my amazement at seeing some of the CEOs starting to show up at 5:30 pm (this in a country not really famous for its punctuality), and youngsters started to trickle in soon after. All day Jawwad, Osama, Adnan and I had this feeling of anticipation of something thrilling and exciting that was about to happen. And boy were we right!\n\nThe atmosphere was electric. There was a buzz. Everyone seemed to be on a high (no liquor and drugs were not on the menu). Around 70 entrepreneurs and wanna-be entrepreneurs together in one room, popping questions, sharing experiences, expressing doubts and concerns, dishing out advice, some agreeing, some not \u2013 all in good humour. Faisal Qureshi being controversial yet speaking from the heart, Jawwad Farid trying not to offend as he passionately talked about flexible working hours and styles and Pakistan being the place where opportunities abound, Adnan Agboatwalla talking about having to make that final leap from a well-paid day job to not getting a salary for a year so that he could chase that dream, Osama bringing in the pains of those first weeks and months of developing a product forgetting to eat and sleep for much of the past 3 years.\n\nThe session started at 6.15 pm. By then the room was full- standing room only. Everyone had been given a sticker with their name on it for easy recognition during the networking break. The proceedings began with the laying down of just a couple of basic ground rules \u2013 all phones on silent (with the threat that any phone that rang was going to be mine since my phone is on the blink and i desperately need a new one); the panel of entrepreneurs would stick to responses that were not too long so that discourse could take place (I had said 2 minutes but didn\u2019t have the heart to stop passionate outpourings of experiences that were crying out to be shared).\n\nQuestions included things like: \n\n 1. How do i know i am cut out to be an entrepreneur?\n\n 2. How much money do i need to start up?\n\n 3. Is it easy to raise capital?\n\n 4. How do i put together a team?\n\n 5. How do i sell my product or service?\n\n 6. What kind of support structures exist?\n\n 7. Should I seek VC funding \u2013 when is the right time?\n\n 8. Is a Business Plan necessary and how do i put one together?\n\n 9. Should I develop a product for which I know there is no market right now because it is ahead of its time?\n\n\u2026.. and a whole load more.\n\n1. To be an entrepreneur you need passion, you need drive, you need to be prepared to take a risk, you need to believe in yourself\u2026 and so on and so forth\n\n 2. How much money did they start with? Jawwad said US$15 loans from wife, mother, father, uncle, friend. Adnan said US$10,000 which they got from their savings. Others said just a laptop and a roof over your head, some food, coffee and an Internet connection.\n\n 3. It is not easy to raise capital until you have a proof of concept, your first customer.\n\n 4. Putting together a team is difficult \u2013 if you can find people who are as crazy about the idea as you are and have different strengths, and will stay with you because they have a stake \u2013 financial or otherwise, that would be ideal. Otherwise do what we do \u2013 hire, train, lose them, hire again \u2013 just don\u2019t let it break your heart and DON\u2019T GIVE UP!\n\n 5. Use networking opportunities like the events P@SHA has, Green & White, Startup Insider sessions like these\n\n 6. VC funding \u2013 Stay away if you can for as long as you can\n\n 7. Business Plans are not always necessary. Sometimes you put one together for an investor, at other times you do it to focus your own thoughts. Templates are available, come to P@SHA and mentors for help, bring a friend who is a business graduate onto your tech team.\n\n 8. Selling your product requires knowing your customers pains, his problems and the money and time your solution can save for him. You need to think on your feet, be able to switch stories that fit a certain scenario (or in Faisal Qureshi\u2019s words \u2018be a bit of a con-artist\u2019)\n\nSo there it is \u2013 only a sampling of what was discussed at this extremely energized session. The Mulazzamat.tv guys were there too to share their experience. We had Faisal Khan CEO of Netxs who came forth with invaluable ideas as did Nauman Sheikh, Dr. Zahir Syed and Azhar Rizvi. We also had the Dawn News team there, the Editor of Spider Magazine Reba Shahid, Rabia Garib Editor in Chief of Netxpress and Asif Qayyum of Si3. Everyone added energy to the discussions. And let us not forget some of the perspectives put forward by Imtiaz Noor who walked in late because he had meetings he couldn\u2019t get out of.\n\nCoffee flowed as did tea and there were chips, samosas, cookies and kulfi \u2013 thanks Adnan! The networking break had people huddling up in groups, getting to know each other and sharing ideas on a one-to-one and one-to-many basis. I loved it and can\u2019t wait for the Lahore and Islamabad ones to happen. Thanks to everyone who showed up and special thanks to Jawwad, Osama, Adnan and the two Faisals.

NIDU states the following Aims & Objectives:\n\n The aim of this project is to create a, \u201dThink Tank\u201d \u00a0to advise, research and analyze the issues having relevance for the realization of goals set in the National IT Policy and IT Action Plan. Major functions of the Unit are to: Arrange sessions with the experts of the relevant IT disciplines to analyze and collect ideas on the assigned issues. Identify experts from the public and private sector so that their expertise can be used to address national issues relating to IT. These experts are organized into working groups designated to come up with concept papers, recommendations or outlines of project proposals. Organize seminars on clearly defined issues. Invite papers from experts to be presented in the seminar. Divide participants into syndicates in order to facilitate formulation of findings and recommendations. This is followed by discussion & analysis in the general assembly. Each seminar concludes with a report including all findings & recommendations. Such reports will be submitted by NIDU to the Government. Engage consultants where required on contract to handle major issues which need critical consultation and inputs for decision making. The assignment of the consultant will be clearly defined in advance along with all other conditions of the contract. Give suggestions and recommendations to the executing agencies of IT projects in various domains. Based on this PC-Is can be prepared. Assist the IT & T Division and other government bodies in identification and materialization of IT related initiatives and IT projects within specific areas.\n\nThere are 4 Working groups that you can register for:\n\nI really think that as many of us as possible should register on this group so that we can give our input to MoITT. Let us start with the E-Crime Bill for instance and then move on to other areas. Let us not merely criticise.

Bright, energetic and passionate entrepreneurs or wanna-be entrepreneurs who have innovative ideas that they want to convert into businesses \u2013 young people needing direction, needing answers to some age-old questions.\n\nOn the flip side there are successful entrepreneurs wanting to share, wanting to answer questions that are never put to them \u2013 how to put together a business plan, how to get access to finance, how to pitch your idea, how to put together a solid team, questions regarding IP and patents \u2013 in fact, anything and everything that a start-up needs to know but was afraid to ask.\n\nWhereas formal mentoring certainly has a role to play, informal get-togethers sometimes generate a lot more discourse resulting in a lot of questions being raised and tackled. And that is the idea of these Coffee sessions.\n\nThe format we will be adopting is:\n\n\u2013 A Startup Insiders meetup will be organized in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad at least once every month \u2013 in Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Board Rooms \u2013 wherever space is available.\n\n\u2013 CEOs, experienced leaders and possible investors will be invited to those sessions.\n\n\u2013 We welcome young entrepreneurs (and older ones too), students, ideas, questions, myths, fears, product demos and pitches.\n\n\u2013 Coffee & snacks will be provided free and you will have a chance to exchange ideas \u2013 argue, concur, relate anecdotes, fears, challenges\n\n\u2013 Each event will be sponsored by one software company which picks up the check. The company\u2019s reps will also be present to talk to anyone who shows up.\n\nThis is a model that has apparently helped entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, and P@SHA and G&W is bringing this home to Pakistan for the first time.\n\nThanks to Osama Hashmi and Green&White for partnering with the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) on this initiative.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2007/12/25/who-is-making-the-sacrifice/", "text": "Eid ul Azha comes and goes and each year I question the slaughter of so many animals \u2013 goats, cows, sheep, camels? I am trying to understand the real meaning of \u2018Qurbani\u2019 which in literal terms means sacrifice. So the question arises: who is making the sacrifice? The humans or the animals? It couldn\u2019t possibly be the human \u2013 who has just bought the animal a few days earlier with the specific purpose of slaughtering him on Eid day. What kind of sacrifice is the human being making? The money he spent on the purchase of the animal? Was this the concept behind the original sacrifice or was it something deeper?\n\nMy understanding is that the sacrifice of animals during the Hajj is meant to be a symbolic act that is meant to commemmorate Hazrat Ibrahim\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his son to show his unquestioning obedience to God. However, where does it say in the Quran that the rest of us, who are not performing Hajj, should slaughter millions of animals in a 3-day period? How does it signify the sacrificing of anything that is near and dear to us?\n\nI am not trying to undermine the fact that most people offer the sacrifice genuinely feeling that it is something that is expected of them as Muslims. They also feel it will help the poor as one-third of the meat is given to the needy. Many of the things we do, nonetheless, have become rituals and no-one actually delves into the whys and whereofs of some of these rituals. This probably comes from the inner belief that religion should not be questioned, just accepted.\n\nHowever, I was listening to Abbas Hussain, an Islamic scholar, on Breakfast at Dawn on Dawn News and what he said made great sense. If we really believe that this is the time for the rest of us to be part of the Qurbani (sacrifice) process, then why don\u2019t we offer something that will actually be a sacrifice? For example, a doctor could give 5 days of treatment to poor patients free; we could go work with orphans \u2013 teach them, feed them, play with them; things like that. Something that involves more than just giving money or slaughtering an animal. That\u2019s an easy thing to do for those with money.

Naturally, I asked him how Lootmaar \u2013 the Pakistani version of eBay \u2013 was doing. After that I had to say no more. He excitedly went into the details of how well the limited beta version was doing \u2013 better than even the optimistic Adnan had hoped.\n\nThere had been a few teething problems \u2013 like the courier company backing out just days before the beta launch and the brilliant techology duo that he had assigned the job to, not being able to give it the kind of time that was needed, due to their changing circumstances and commitments.\n\nThe courier problem was initially temporarily solved in a rather odd fashion by Noman (Adnan\u2019s partner) actually spending his time on Karachi\u2019s streets picking up and delivering packages. Since this was not a sustainable model, they are now close to striking a deal with another courier company that has a large network across the country.\n\nAs for the technology issue, the solution for that came through Adnan\u2019s blog. He blogged about the problems he was facing and a firm of geeks based in Lahore contacted him. They talked, Adnan loved the fact that they understood exactly what he needed \u2013 or, in Adnan\u2019s own words \u201cthey spoke geek\u201d, and the rest, as they say, is history. The team of 15 based in Lahore will be taking on the task of making sure that Lootmaar continues to evolve and operate smoothly. Good luck Adnan. We will be watching!\n\nP.S.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2007/12/14/room-for-women/", "text": "It seems room is now being made for women in senior and middle-management positions within the largest companies in India. In fact, headhunters are being asked to shortlist women for management roles \u2013 this according to The Economic Times which says that Blue chip India is rolling out the red carpet for women professionals.\n\nCompanies like Bharti Enterprises, American Express, Wal-Mart, Shell, IBM and Microsoft are using a variety of policies to promote gender diversity. While American Express asks for at least one-third representation among those appearing for job interviews, it\u2019s 25-30% for Bharti. According to Inder Walia, Bharti\u2019s HR head, Bharti group flagship Airtel will soon have a woman at a very senior position, as part of its gender diversity programme. At present women comprise around 20% of the group\u2019s total workforce.\n\nWal-Mart and Shell, who both have a global gender policy say they are trying to implement the same policy in India. The technology sector too is jumping on the bandwagon. IBM, whose employee base in India is 53,000, has 26% representation of women. They are offering special incentives to recruitment consultants in order to get more qualified women professionals into the organisation.\n\nIt is thought that although gender diversity programs actually began as part of employer branding initiatives, it is the talent crunch that is driving companies towards adopting more women-friendly policies. Presently it is estimated that 25% of the IT and ITeS workforce in India is female. This figure is expected to grow significantly in the coming months.\n\nStudies have shown that a diverse workforce is always a better business proposition. The dynamics and culture in an organisation undergo a significant change when there is gender balance. Emphasis is being placed worldwide on leveraging individual differences for business advantage. The participation of women has always been seen to enhance a company\u2019s overall performance.\n\nSo what is happening in Pakistan? Does anyone have any statistics? Yes, there are a growing number of women in the workforce but still nowhere near enough. What are we doing to change that? Or are we waiting for the talent crunch to hit (some say it already has) before we start looking at attracting more women into our organisations?\n\nIT & IT Enabled service companies in Pakistan are facing a shortage of good quality workers. Some of them are already starting to incorporate flexi-time and work-from-home programs as part of their HR policies. Women have been found to be much more dedicated and quality-driven. They take ownership of projects. They are naturals at juggling numerous tasks and carrying them to fruition without a hitch. Companies who don\u2019t recruit and retain women have no idea what they are missing.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Room for women?"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2007/12/10/human-resource-managers-get-together-in-karachi/", "text": "It was a day for 150 HR Managers, Directors and practitioners to get together and deliberate on the Emerging Issues in Human Resource Management. The National HRM Conference had been organized by Nutshell Forum for just this purpose.\n\nBut there were some intruders in their midst \u2013 the likes of Dr. Aamir Matin, Country GM of Cisco Systems and Furqan Qureshi, GM Marketing & Communications of Wateen Telecom and of course yours truly ;)\n\nSo what was I doing there? Azfar Ahsan, the CEO of Nutshell Forum, had been kind enough to invite me and, since we as an industry have identified the development of quality Human Resource as being one of our key focus areas, I thought I would sit in and see if there was anything new being said.\n\nIt was a well organized conference as Nutshell\u2019s events usually are. However, a number of presentations took us through much of what has been presented many times before. There were some sharing of programs by organizations \u2013 things that have worked in the areas of retention and motivation \u2013 nothing very earth-shattering though.\n\nA panel moderated by Dr. Aamir Matin livened things up a bit. On the panel were the heads of HR from AKU, MCB and Dubai Islamic Bank and Furqan Qureshi. The discussion centred on the role of HR departments in the overall capacity building process when it was clearly recognized that line managers were directly involved in evaluating, mentoring, motivating and recognizing talent. Were HR departments then just a support and facilitating arm of the organization \u2013 were they there simply to implement training programs? This of course resulted in quite a lot of discussion on how much more HR managers were responsible for \u2013 they were there as counsellors, as people who developed policy and carried out recruitment programs as well as motivated the teams and were there to act as a buffer in case things went wrong between line managers and teams.\n\nAnother question that was brought up was whether HR was actually a profession \u2013 didn\u2019t many people who ended up in HR start their lives in other career segments? How many HR heads ended up as CEOs of companies? Were HR practitioners restricted to their own silos or did they spend enough time interacting with employees in the organization, connecting with them and understanding what the real issues were?\n\nThere were also questions about flexi-time for women and the necessity for day care centres to be available if more women were to be attracted to the workforce. Some of the attendees shared programs where women worked on certain projects from home and came in a few hours a week. Most of the panel agreed that women were a lot more committed to their jobs and took much more ownership of projects than did their male counterparts. The audience was heavily involved in the discussions and that\u2019s why I thought this was a very productive and interesting session.\n\nA lot of networking took place on the sidelines of this event. Deals were discussed and appointments made. Overall, a good event but i would suggest that next time they have a mixture of HR managers and CEOs as well as some run-of-the-mill employees. That would make the discussion much more lively.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Human Resource Managers get together in\u00a0Karachi"},

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/an-evening-with-david-barsamian/", "text": "\u201cMainstream media is a source of mass distraction\u201d, was how David Barsamian started his talk at The Second Floor in Karachi on Sunday evening. That certainly was enough to grab my attention. I read somewhere that he sometimes follows that up with \u201cWe ought to have UN inspectors viewing the media and there should be public health reports. Like with cigarettes: This is dangerous for your health.\n\nDavid is the award winning founder and director of Alternative Radio, the independent weekly series based in Boulder, Colorado. He is a radio producer, journalist, author and lecturer. He has been working in radio since 1978. His interviews and articles appear regularly in The Progressive and Z Magazine.\n\nHis latest books are Targeting Iran with Noam Chomsky, Ervand Abrahamian, Nahid Mozaffari, What We Say Goes and Imperial Ambitions with Noam Chomsky,Speaking of Empire & Resistance with Tariq Ali and Original Zinn with Howard Zinn . His earlier books include Propaganda and the Public Mind: Conversations with Noam Chomsky; Eqbal Ahmad: Confronting Empire and The Decline and Fall of Public Broadcasting.\n\nFriends of Community Media gave him the 2007 Media Education Award for outstanding work as a progressive media voice. The Institute for Alternative Journalism named him one of its \u201cTop Ten Media Heroes.\u201d\n\nWhen I heard that he was in Karachi and would be speaking at T2F, I just had to overcome my exhaustion from the Singapore trip and drive across town to listen to him. I was glad I did. He spoke for about two hours. His talk was a mixture of wit, analysis and harsh facts. At certain junctures I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry. That is the kind of emotion that he aroused in the audience that evening. There was one woman who kept giggling at the saddest of stories because he related them with a mixture of sweet-bitter wit.\n\nDavid started off by telling us that he was not an educated man \u2013 that he dropped out of high school before the education system had been able to \u201ccondition\u201d him. Like most people who are self-taught, he has a global view and an open mind. Hence he appears to have a depth of knowledge and an ability to sift through and analyse whatever information is \u201cfed\u201d to him.\n\nTalking about mainstream media in the US, he says that news and programming are heavily self-censored and hence a lot of filtering takes place. He said that most Americans are unaware of the damage and destruction carried out by American Foreign Policy in the Middle East and other developing countries.\n\nThere is more airtime dedicated to details regarding the adoption of a child by Madonna and OJ Simpson\u2019s activities and what Brittney Spears is up to than to any serious domestic or foreign issue. Iran is made out to be the evil power that wants to attack and wage war. But history indicates, says David, that Iran has not attacked any other country in 250 years whereas, in the recent past, no two years have passed without the US waging war on one country or the other.\n\nHe said people in the US do not know how the attack on Iraq has resulted in more refugees than exist in Darfur. It is just not covered in Amercian mainstream media.\n\nTalking about Alternative Radio, David said that organizations like his actually looked at world isuses \u201cmore fairly\u201d and because they were not part of large groups, they were not affiliated to any political groups. Alternative media does not carry advertising and so does not have to be sensitive to issues that may annoy advertisers. They are therefore more \u201cindependent\u201d in their views.\n\nHow do they survive then? Well, according to David, more and more people want to know the truth and hence people send an annual subscription fee; some send in money for the radio station to be able to carry on their work. There are speaking opportunities for which David is paid. They sell CDs of interviews and program archives \u2013 anything that does not compromise the content of the programming.\n\nI find the concept of alternative media to be an amazing one and with technology advancing at the rate it has, it will be easier and cheaper to find avenues of running such media channels.\n\nCommunity radio is something that needs to flourish so that more discourse takes place, more consensus and understanding can be developed, more sharing of knowledge and experience becomes possible. This one-to-many approach of mainstream media is just not a healthy practice, nor a democratic one.\n\nListening to David Barsamian was a delight. I wish more media students had been present to listen to him on Sunday at T2F. These are the kind of talks that opens up the minds of people young and old. I hope he will be back amongst us soon. He is headed for Lahore \u2013 I hope Lahore education institutions and those interested in media studies will take the opportunity to organize some talks where he can share his thoughts and experiences.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "An evening with David\u00a0Barsamian"},

There was an APICTA Exco meeting which I had to attend. Checked out of the hotel in the morning before I headed for the meeting which was to start at 9:30 a.m. It was at the Singapore Management University which had become our home away from home during this trip.\n\nThe meeting was intense and went on until 3:30 pm. After it concluded I had a few hours to kill since I wasn\u2019t due to leave for the airport until past 11 pm. I decided to take an MRT ride to Orchard Road, browse around the two large bookshops and take in the Christmas lights. I must have walked miles stopping at various places to take a break and rest my aching feet.\n\nAlways tempted by Marks & Spencer I walked into the basement store as I emerged from Borders the bookstore. Decided to try on some shirts. It was in the changing room that I heard what sounded like a fire alarm. I quickly gathered the shirts and went out. I asked the salesgirl if there was a fire. She shrugged and replied \u201cCould be laah \u2013 that is a fire alarm!\u201d I looked at her quizzically and then rushed out of the store. That is when I saw the smoke. It was so dense that I was already coughing from the effects of it. Looking up, I saw that it was the adjacent building that seemed to be on fire. I stopped only to click a photo for this blog before I rushed off down the block to catch the MRT back to Raffles City. Was it a close call? No but it could have been \u2013 and it did cause a panic.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "A close call or just a\u00a0scare?"},

Their products and their presentations were appreciated by experts from the region. By taking the time to go to Singapore and benchmarking their products against the best in Asia Pacific, they made Pakistan look good. So thanks to all our stars.\n\nThe most difficult part of this entire exercise for the judges is to keep the names of the winners a secret until they are announced on the night of the Awards. We were bound by the Code of Ethics that we were signatories to, to keep our big mouths shut and not to let on who the winners were. So we talked about everything else and stuck to our guns even when faced with the most persuasive of nominees.\n\nIt was worth it though. When the Master of Ceremonies announced the Best of Communications Award was a tie between Pixsense and a Malaysian company, the Pakistanis in the audience went wild. If Adnan Agboatwalla doesn\u2019t look too thrilled in this photo, it may be because he would rather not have shared the Award with anyone. Well done Adnan! You did us proud and we are thrilled that PixSense has developed a product that is not only recognized by the likes of Telenor, Vodaphone and China Mobile but also by the toughest judges in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThe Financial Applications Category, like the Communications Category, came up against cutting edge applications developed by the best teams from Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, China, etc but Netsol Technologies\u2019 LeaseSoft application stood out and was declared the overall Winner in the Financial Category. Khalid Iqbal, VP of LeaseSoft Marketing, could simply not believe it! His feet didn\u2019t touch the ground for quite a while. The rest of us jumped out of our seats to congratulate Khalid. The Chief Judge and the Economy Heads came over to us and congratulated us when the PixSense and Netsol Awards were announced. Pakistan is right up there when it comes to producing top quality software and we have proven it!\n\nThe teams in Pakistan were not left behind as SMSes and phone calls were put through right away to share the good news. Dawn News had been on standby and was the first to run the news regarding Pakistan\u2019s success at APICTA.\n\nOne thing that I wanted to highlight here. The Pakistani companies that went to APICTA went on their own steam. P@SHA is admittedly covering their airfare but other than that, none of them received any kind of support from any other source. Compare this with the likes of Singapore and Malaysia. Each of them brought about 30 companies. They always do. All the costs are covered by their governments. I remember last year the Malaysian Economy head told me that around 30 ICT entrepreneurs were sponsored by the Malaysian government for a week\u2019s entrepreneurship course at MIT \u2013 this included the fees, the airfare and the accommodation. Now that is what I call support. That\u2019s not all \u2013 both governments actually provide angel funds for young people to try out innovative ideas. They showcase the products all over the world. There is much more talent that exists within the Pakistan ICT sector. More emphasis on education, on R&D and on the recognition, facilitation and growth of a young and energetic sector, might do wonders for this country.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Netsol & PixSense win Awards at\u00a0APICTA"},

This room was slightly bigger than the one we had been given the day before. Some of the entries were quite interesting but there was one that stood out \u2013 and that was the one from Thailand. The two young men knew their market and had developed a product that was not only making money for them but was serving the tourism sector well. The judges had no hesitation in coming to a unanimous decision regarding the winner.\n\nThe second day of judging was followed by some meetings to finalize the score sheets and sign off on the winning entries. In some categories there was debate and disagreement \u2013 in fact in one category the Chief Judge and Adjudicators had to be called in to facilitate a decision.\n\nThe Judges Final Meeting the next day confirmed the results in all categories. In addition, it was discussed that the Economy Coordinators needed to play a more significant role in the selection of nominees. There were problems when certain nominations were placed in more than one category. There were also cases where the nominated product was placed in the wrong category. It was suggested that if the Economy Coordinators would take care of these things prior to the judging, it would save time later.\n\nAnyway, all\u2019s well that ends well. Everyone was congratulated on the hard work they had put in and following the APICTA Exco\u2019s confirmation of the results, everyone dispersed so that they could get ready for the Awards that night.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "APICTA \u2013 the judging\u00a0continues"},

There was no way that I was going to be in Singapore and be confined to the four walls of SMU and The Stamford. So at night, once we had changed into civilian gear, we headed out for Arab Street to try some Iranian food. It started off with only Zia, Jawwad and me venturing out but soon we were joined by Adnan (of Pixsense) \u2013 actually we picked him up from his hotel on the way from Arab Street to Boat Quay , Osama (from Green&White) , Nadeem (of Infotech) & Hinnah (Nadeem\u2019s wife), Sultan (of Maison Consulting) and Ali Sabzwari (from Si3).\n\nAt first I had grumbled about being dragged to Arab Street. I had thought we were heading for Chinatown or some other exciting part of town. But the Iranian food turned out to be quite good and so I was silenced pretty quickly. However, I insisted that after the meal I was going to take the others to Boat Quay \u2013 one of my regular haunts when I visited Singapore in the old days. There was some resistance to this suggestion but I am not easily dissuaded so off we went.\n\nOnce we were there, everyone was quite happy that I had suggested this side trip. They loved the atmosphere, the view, the coffee and the cheese cake. We sat by the water and had our coffee and chatted and joked until we were finally told that the coffee shop was closing for the night and we should leave. Nadeem & Hinnah decided to go back to their hotel but Sabzwari and I had heard jazz tunes emanating from the first floor. Turned out to be a Jazz Club with a live band. So naturally the rest of us moved upstairs and there we stayed for the next hour and a half. We sat right up front and were a most appreciative audience. Round about 12:30 or 12:45 pm, we decided that if we were going to make it for the morning meeting, we had better head back to our hotels. And so we bade farewell to the vocalist and the band \u2013 having exchanged cards and having promised that we would invite them for our event in Pakistan.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2007/12/04/apicta-awards-the-judging-begins/", "text": "The Asia Pacific ICT Awards (APICTA) is an international Awards Program, the purpose of which is to increase ICT awareness in the community and assist in bridging the Digital Divide. By providing networking and product benchmarking opportunities to ICT innovators and entrepreneurs in the region, the program is designed to stimulate ICT innovation and creativity, promote economic and trade relations, facilitate technology transfer, and offer business matching opportunities via exposure to venture capitalists and investors. Participants of the Awards Program comprise members of the APICTA Alliance. The Awards are held in a different member economy each year.\n\nThis year APICTA was held in Singapore alongwith the ASOCIO ICT Summit and General Assembly. The Asian-Oceanian Computing Industry Organization (ASOCIO) has since 1984 been the bridge for IT companies in the region to expand their network of contacts, conduct business with each together and develop their capabilities. ASOCIO has dedicated itself to promoting, encouraging and fostering relationships, while promoting trade between its 20 member organizations.\n\nThe Judging for the APICTA Awards began early on November 28. The judges were asked to be in the lobby of their hotels at 7:15 am (yes, it is a hard life being a judge). We were to have breakfast at the Singapore Management University (SMU) before the judging began at 8:30 a.m. This was a ploy on the part of the Chief Judge because he knew that if he didn\u2019t get the judges there early, the schedule might be affected if any of them were tardy. Good ploy don\u2019t you think?\n\nThe Head Judge in the Communications category was Riyanto from Indonesia. Amongst the other judges on my panel were Kenneth Vong from Macau, Alex Lin from Singapore and Osman from Brunei. We were put in Room 4 which was so small that there was hardly any space for us to move around. I had a crick in my neck from watching 13 presentations on the projection screen. The quality of presentations was extremely good. Most of the products were innovative and were commercially accepted products. There were some that were new and had yet to be tested on \u2018real\u2019 people. I, for one, felt that some of them would have done better in the R&D Category. They lost mileage because they could not produce actual implementation and customer response statistics. When Adnan Agboatwalla of PixSense presented I felt so proud. He did a superb job of presenting just what was needed and he did it with the right mix of brilliance and professionalism. He fielded the questions like an expert and was able to satisfy most of the judges. As far as I was concerned, he proved himself to be a winner in the 35 minutes that were allotted to him.\n\nAs a judge at these events, it is difficult to be totally unbiased but if you are fair in your assessment of the products that are being prsented, the winners are so obvious. The judging guidelines for APICTA have been streamlined every year based on feedback from nominees, judges and Exco members. The Alliance wants to ensure the integrity of these Awards and is working hard to ensure that nothing interferes with that.\n\nIn the Communications category there was a lot of competition because of the growth in the mobile market and the expanding services being offered in different parts of the world. The entrepreneurs who came to present all shared one thing \u2013 they were passionate and excited about the breakthroughs they had made. They were clear about the gaps they were filling in the market and the growth potential for their products. Most of them had a vision and knew that the goal posts would keep moving and they couldn\u2019t afford to stand still if they were to succeed in this arena.\n\nThe caffeine kept flowing to keep us alert and functional. I don\u2019t know about the judges who were in the other categories but I wasn\u2019t bored for a moment even though we started at 8:30 am and the judging went on till about 6:30 pm. It was no doubt tiring but it was mentally stimulating. We exchanged notes as we met in the corridors of SMU during coffee and lunch breaks. Young people from various colleges were dressed in black and asked to be timekeepers and coordinators and data entry operators.

After a couple of days of seeing this sign I began to wonder who Old Chang Kee was and whether he had been old since 1956? Was he still around? If so, wouldn\u2019t he be much older? I just had to investigate. Apparently the origins of Old Chang Kee were extremely humble. It started as a small stall in a coffee shop outside a cinema hall in Singapore. The curry puff which was the signature brand of Old Chang Kee was a delicious pastry filled with curried potatoes, chicken and a slice of egg \u2013 it captured the hearts (and stomachs) of Singaporeans in no time at all.\n\nSince then the Old Chang Kee brand has grown and flourished. It\u2019s star brands are:\n\nThe mission of Old Chang Kee is simple \u2013 to deliver the best quality and most delicious hot finger foods and ready meals to residents and tourists alike.\n\nI have yet been unable to find out who founded it. Was Old Chang Kee a person? What I have been able to discover is that the business was bought out in 1986 by Han Kee Juan who left a cushy job with an MNC and decided to turn this popular stall into a flourishing business. Sound familiar all you budding entrepreneurs out there?\n\nWell, it worked. He now has many stalls, provides ready meals to supermarkets and shopping malls. He also has a large factory. But did he stop there? Nope. In 1996 he decided that if he wanted the business to grow he would have to bring in new, young blood with innovative ideas and new marketing ideas to deal with an ever-changing consumer market. So he hired young William Lim, a graduate from Australia, as the Managing Director of Old Chang Kee.\n\nThe business has grown under young William\u2019s leadership, the branding has become more impactful and it has started to appeal to all segments of the multi-racial, multi-religious Singapore society. Quite a story eh? But I still don\u2019t know who Old Chang Kee was. Was he even a person? Can anyone enlighten me?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Old Chang Kee"},
{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2007/12/03/the-apicta-awards-a-blow-by-blow-account/", "text": "I arrived in Singapore on the evening of November 25. After checking into my hotel, I met up with Jawwad Farid of Alchemy Technologies and Zia Imran of Vahzay Inc and together we went to Vivo City to have some dinner. Jawwad had selected a restaurant by the name of Ramen 10, a Japanese place that served very spicy food in addition to the normal sushi and sashimi. Poor Zia (egged on by some sort of machoism, had the spiciest of the meals on offer \u2013 but he survived it in the end). Adnan Agboatwalla of Pixsense joined us a little later and we went off for coffee at Starbucks and sticky rice desserts that Jawwad became addicted to over the next few days.\n\nThe next morning we had arranged to meet with some of the Pakistani companies at my hotel. The idea was to share our experiences of previous APICTA events and point out what it was that the judges were looking at when they assessed products from the region. Most of the software products that are nominated for these Awards from different economies are top notch. Hence very often it is the approach that you take in presenting your software product, that gives a product more of an edge. And that is what we were trying to relay to the nominees from Pakistan.\n\nZia, Jawwad and I spent about 3 hours with them after which we ventured out for lunch to the Magic Wok which is a Thai restaurant in the vicinity of Raffles City Convention centre. Delicious food and refreshing young coconuts provided us with the energy to deal with the rest of the day.\n\nIn the afternoon there was a Judges\u2019 Briefing and since the three of us were judges from Pakistan, we headed for the Singapore Management University where the briefing was to take place. At SMU we met up with judges from the rest of the Asia Pacific region. Many of them were already known to Jawwad and me since this was not our first time at APICTA.\n\nThe head of the Singapore IT Federation, and the Chief Judge Professor Daniel Tan of Singapore presided over the Judges\u2019 Briefing and allotted us our categories and time slots. We were also given folders which contained detailed nomination forms of the products we would be judging. We were supposed to study them overnight in preparation for the judging that started the next morning. Each of us would be judging almost products. Yikes! I was allotted the Communications and the Tourism & Hospitality Categories, Jawwad had the Tertiary Student Project Category, Zia was given the Industrial Applications and Startup Categories and Sultan Hamdani was allotted the Financial Applications Category.\n\nIt was emphasized that the Code of Conduct for the judges was very important. In fact if I am not mistaken, we were all asked to sign the Code of Conduct document at least 3 different times :-) \u2013 once before we got to Singapore, the second time on the day of the Judges\u2019 Briefing and the third time on the morning of the first Judging day. The roles and responsibilities of the judges, the Head Judges and the Chief Judge and adjudicators was also discussed so that everyone was aware of what they were to do. The folders also contained the scoring sheets. Since some of the judges had not shown up for various reasons, a little bit of juggling took place to ensure that all categories were covered adequately. Our Singaporean hosts were quite thorough with the instructions. We were told that we should conduct ourselves very professionally \u2013 no reading email or browsing while nominees are presenting, no taking phone calls or using blackberries, no dropping off to sleep :-)\n\nBriefing over we were put in a bus and taken to the joint ASOCIO/APICTA Welcome Reception. Here we networked with delegates who were there for both events. Whoever we ran into asked with great concern how we were and told us how happy they were that we were able to make it to Singapore despite the serious situation in our country. We told them that yes politically there were problems but day-to-day activities and businesses were not affected directly. We had serious issues that we as a nation had to contend with and we would but that hadn\u2019t resulted in the country coming to a standstill.\n\nThere were some speeches from the Chairman of the Singapore IT Federation, the APICTA Chairman Stephen Lau and the ASOCIO President Ashank Desai followed by a welcome address from the Singapore Minister for ICT. We were then finally allowed to attack the food. Since it was a stand-up reception, we were quite tired by this time and ate little but I did attack the Ice Kachang (a Malaysian version of the gola gunda that includes ice shavings, fruits, jellies and various coloured liquids). There was some excitement when the head of the Sri Lankan delegation fainted. Doctors from Hong kong who were on the scene attended to him after which he was taken to hospital and kept overnight for observation. Apparently the humidity, an empty stomach and insufficient sleep over the past couple of days had been responsible for the fainting spell.\n\nThere were some cultural performances which followed during dinner i think but I wasn\u2019t too keen \u2013 have seen them all too many times before.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "The APICTA Awards \u2013 a blow by blow\u00a0account"},

Normally that would be true but not if you book through Sultan\u2019s travel agent.\n\nWe were put on a flight that took 15 hours to get to our destination. First we went to Dubai, transit time in Dubai was around 4 hours. The Emirates Business Class lounge was so chock-a-block that it was difficult finding a vacant chair. I eventually found one and parked myself there \u2013 but not for long. It was so clautrophobic because of the number of people that I decided to leave this elite lounge and go outside where there was more room to breathe.\n\nSomehow \u2013 due to my ability to access the Net \u2013 I was able to get through that 4 hour transit only to find once I boarded the plane, that it was in fact headed for Colombo \u2013 something the travel agent had failed to mention. So off we went to Colombo, where we were in transit for just over an hour before we finally headed for Singapore.\n\nBy the time we finally got to Changi Airport, we were totally washed out. I was therefore not at all in a mood to be told when I got to Swissotel The Stamford Hotel that my booking was for the next day! Yikes! Would this nightmare journey never end? Got that sorted out after some irritation, some pleading and some yelling. That was not the end of it though. When the hotel tried to process my VISA Gold card, they were told to call the bank. The reason? The bank said that since I was trying to use the card in a city that was not my city of residence, they had to check whether it was really me! What amazing logic! When am I most likely to use my card? When I am travelling right? Sigh!", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "A never-ending journey to\u00a0Singapore"},

I sat in on the demonstration of the product, listened to the questions fired at Osama and Qazi by the development, domain and implementation teams and then I was a fly on the wall as the Alchemy team discussed internally how and if this product could make a difference to their work processes.

It is called \u201cThe Emergency Times\u201d. I am sharing it because it has renewed my hope in where this country is headed.\n\nFor decades, generations have stood by as this nation was exploited, subverted, pillaged by its own leaders; Leaders who told us to sit quietly while they bled the very soil of this land. We yearned for justice, for peace, for development, for honesty and accountability, but received little. Over the years, many of us lost faith in our own identity \u2013 we were no longer \u2018proud of being Pakistani\u2019. Skepticism and cynicism became inherent Pakistani traits. Our culture, our traditions, we slowly lost touch with. Successive 14th August\u2019s passed without a whimper; Pakistan, we felt, no longer belonged to any of us.\n\nToday, at the most critical juncture that this country has seen in its turbulent history for decades, we have an opportunity \u2013 maybe our last \u2013 to change all of that. Today, we have the chance to salvage our country\u2019s future, to save it from destruction, to save it from the very apathy that threatens to devour it whole.\n\nWhy are we protesting, people ask me? To usher in another corrupt politician? To open the doors for another dynastic arrangement that exploits whatever\u2019s left of this tattered nation? What are we fighting for?\n\nTo them, I extend one simple answer; we are fighting for Pakistan.\n\nWe are fighting because soon, there might not be anything left to quarrel over. We are fighting for the country\u2019s future, a future where people are socially and politically conscious, where injustice is not complacently tolerated, where the masses are empowered and equal. Where the most destitute denizens of society can seek the same justice as its rulers. Where corrupt politicians do not dare steal from the nations coffers. We are fighting for institutions that can ensure this, for institutions that prevent the abuse of despotic and political power, institutions that protect our rights. And unless that is ensured, none of Pakistan\u2019s myriad of problems will be solved, however much our Messianic General wishes us to think so. And yes, make no mistake about it; we are fighting savage, unrestrained oppression.\n\nYes, the fight will be long and hard. Along the way, it will be beset with disappointment, with frustration and restlessness.\n\nBut, for once, I want being Pakistani to mean more for me than cheering a cricket match victory, or mindlessly waving a green flag on the 14th of August. I want to \u2018be\u2019 this country, to feel one with it, to be proud of it in all respects, to heal the wounds that decades of turmoil have wrought upon its crumbling visage. And, in these darkest of times, I pledge, as Allah is my witness, to do my utmost to make that happen.\n\nAnd no, this fight does not end with the end of the emergency. This fight continues until we can truly claim to have made a difference. Until we have purged this country of all the anathemas that threaten its survival; from military rule, to corruption, to inequality, to intolerance, to terrorism, to socio-political apathy.\n\nWhen young people \u2013 at LUMS, Karachi University, BNU, and at flash demos in different cities \u2013 decide that they have finally had enough, I see a ray of hope. Our apathy, which is responsible for the free hand politicians have always had in ruining this country, needs to end.

It was early morning and there wasn\u2019t a lot of traffic but as rickshaws and motorbikes and suzukis went past us \u2013 most of which did not have silencers that worked \u2013 the noise started to invade my space and affect the peace and quiet that are a normal part of my Sunday morning.\n\nThat is when I started to think about the noise pollution that surrounds us \u2013 a lot of which we \u2018get used to\u2019 and therefore turn a . Little do we know that it may well be that we haven\u2019t actually adjusted to the noise; that it is more than likely that our hearing has been affected by the constant noise that polutes our atmosphere.\n\nSo how would you define noise? Students of acoustics define noise as complex sound waves with irregular vibrations and no definite pitch. Engineers define noise as a signal that interferes with the detection of another signal. I would define it in two simple words \u2013 !\n\nCan loud music, the sound of heavy traffic, machinery, tools, household equipment, toys, movie surround-sound, aeroplanes, loud conversation or the ring of an alarm clock be termed as noise? The answer to all these questions is a resounding yes! Any noise level over 80 decibels is potentially a danger to your hearing and to your psychological well-being. The impact varies depending on how loud the sound is and for what length of time you are exposed to it. Listening to music through headphones over a significant period of time, is considered to be one of the possible reasons for the loss of hearing in young adults. And let us not forget the screaming that one has to indulge in on a daily basis to get anything done right. The noise! The noise! The noise!\n\nNoise pollution not only causes hearing loss, it can also result in increased blood pressure, cardiovascular changes, respiratory problems, mood changes and disturbed sleep patterns. I wonder how many people notice that their voices get louder in response to the ambient sound, that irritation and anger become \u2018normal reactions\u2019 to a constant invasion of ones peace and tranquility by the loud sounds that are a part of our everyday lives.\n\nIt is imperative that we recognize this and start creating an awareness of the negative impact of noise on young children and also in adults in the workplace, in the home and in our every day environment.\n\nI just remembered that my friend Vic wrote an article about sound solutions for people in his column Mumbai Mumbles that explores this topic in depth.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Noise is difficult to define \u2026 and yet it is all around\u00a0us"},

The five finalists \u2013 Alchemy, Autosoft, Sofizar, Softech and Tohfay \u2013 took 20 minutes each to tell us their stories, finally ending up with their strategies for accelerating the growth of their businesses over the next 5 years. The presentations were impressive and showed how much work and thought had gone into the process.\n\nMITCEF\u2019s Business Acceleration Program was launched in August with the objective of assisting IT and ITES companies in Pakistan to grow to the next level by providing expert coaching and mentoring.\n\nSince most companies here are shy to share revenue statistics and strategies, it was not surprising that companies actually had to be cajoled into joining the Business Acceleration Program. A total of 20 companies from across Pakistan took part. All of them went through intense coaching and mentoring with local and foreign entrepreneurs. The process enabled them to look at weak areas, change strategy, re-construct business plans and review what they had done thus far and what the roadmap should be for the future.\n\nThe advice they received, the questions they were asked, the self-assessment that followed, and the lessons they learnt were all totally invaluable. Speaking to some of them over the last few weeks, I was able to see how much they had gained from the program. Ken Morse and Bill Aulet from the MIT Entrepreneurship Centre have been an integral part of this program, as have many entrepreneurs from within and outside Pakistan.\n\nFor details regarding the experience that Alchemy went through, read Jawwad\u2019s blog. The event was also covered heavily in Green&White.\n\nDr. Zahir A. Syed, Syed Azhar Rizvi, Imran Sayeed and the entire MITCEF team need to be congratulated for coming up with an excellent program and for executing it beautifully. This will be run again early next year and I hope that those companies who had reservations about participating in this initial phase, will take advantage of it in 2008.\n\nThis year\u2019s MITCEF BAP award distribution ceremony was followed by the announcement of the launch of the *Tech Angels Network (TAN) by Professor Ken Morse. This will mark the beginning of angel investment into Pakistan\u2019s talented technology sector.\n\nMany of us have always had great faith in the Pakistan IT industry and its\n\n potential. The past couple of years have justified our faith as companies\n\n like Scrybe, Amaana, Alchemy, PixSense, Mobile Complete, CDF, Orgoo etc have appeared on our landscape bringing forth technology innovation and\n\n attracting investment. With programs such as the MITCEP BAP, the TiE Business Plan Competition and P@SHA\u2019s continued efforts and commitment, our companies will continue to make a mark for themselves in local and international markets.\n\nSofizar, which was the formal winner of the MITCEF BAP, and their product TicketNest.com, has been covered beautifully by Osama Hashmi in this post.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "MITCEF BAP \u2013 an excellent\u00a0initiative!"},

Such a statement is usually followed up by a question: why are our IT exports not touching billions of dollars?\n\nLet us forget the rest of the issues for the moment and talk about IT infrastructure. For the past 4 years I can\u2019t remember how many times I have told anyone who will listen \u2013 the government, the media, builders, investors, \u2013 that we NEED top notch IT Parks which provide sufficient office space at a reasonable cost, clean and fast bandwidth, uninterrupted power supply, conference and exhibition facilities, showcasing areas, research, development and testing facilities, incubation facilities, recreation areas, with all connected services being available within the Park -, a professional and secure environment where young people (and some of the more experienced) can interact and work, sharing and creating knowledge. Has anyone listened? I don\u2019t know. We keep hearing that all these parks are coming up but I have yet to see any land being identified in Karachi for the purpose \u2013 there ARE one or two towers that are being put up by the PITB in Lahore but again, they are buildings, not a complete environment \u2013 although it is a start. There is \u2018something\u2019 coming up in Islamabad but what exactly and when, is something we will probably know one day.\n\nIn the meantime, our IT and ITES companies struggle with, amongst so many other challenges, the lack of infrastructure. I don\u2019t know how many people are aware that there was a fire at Caesar Towers on Saturday. Caesar Towers is our National IT Park we are told. It is on Shahrah-e-Faisal in Karachi. One of the most pathetic buildings you have ever seen. It is perpetually in \u2018construction\u2019 mode and you would certainly never take a potential overseas customer there if you could avoid it. This building was provided fibre connectivity by PSEB some years ago and a large number of unsuspecting IT companies moved into the building \u2013 from software development companies, to content management companies to call centres. Over the years they have had a number of confrontations with the building managers/owners over various issues like connectivity, power problems, bad management, etc.\n\nThe fire on Saturday destroyed all the main power and internet cabling which will have to be totally replaced. A real disaster especially for companies that are providing 24\u00d77 service to overseas customers. Some had contingency in place and I was impressed at the speed with which companies like Etilize set up in new premises almost overnight. But there are others who are still struggling. Some have moved to Korangi or to Tariq Centre \u2013 which is the newest PSEB-identified IT Park on Tariq Road. Some companies are working with skeleton staff with generators. P@SHA member companies have been generous and have offered temporary space to some of the affected companies, but office space is at a premium in this city and companies are already bursting at the seams themselves. It is a tragedy that an industry that has so much potential in terms of providing efficiency to other industries, in terms of increased export earnings, in terms of providing job opportunities to young people in this country, in terms of creating knowledge and innovation, should be neglected in this way.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "First class IT\u00a0infrastructure?"},

Well I got up yesterday morning to find that I could not access my gmail and yahoo accounts. At first I assumed that perhaps there was a problem with those services or with my ISP. However, everything else seemed to be working.

I have her very first published poem. I have photos of her \u2013 some of which she may actually want destroyed (one day when Ragni wins a Grammy or an Oscar or both, these things will become extremely valuable \u2013 although, to me, they already are).\n\nRecognition, of course, goes beyond Awards. More important is the motivation for the work, the commitment with which one does it, and the value one personally attaches to it as well as the satisfaction one derives from it. Work earns its own rewards. However, recognition sometimes brings the issue one is trying to address to the forefront, and in certain cases spurs some people into doing some much-needed things. I know that Awards are very often open to criticism but until people learn how to value themselves, some form of public perception is the only thing we have. As long as it works toward the benefit of a cause, or highlights good work and innovation, it will continue to play a positive role.\n\nAs a very young child, Ragni questioned her Karachi Grammar School teacher about the banishing of a Parsi girl from the Islamiat class. She started the Youth Initiative for Peace which brought together young people from India and Pakistan for a retreat at which they discussed possible solutions for peace in the subcontinent.\n\nI was therefore not surprised when I heard that her first film was not just a \u201cpretty moving picture\u201d but addressed a social issue that was not generally talked about in polite Pakistani society.\n\nRagni is the Director & Producer of Bindiya Chamkay Gi which is a short documentary-narrative about Bindiya, an outspoken member of the Khwaja Sirra (Hijra) community in Karachi. The film was screened yesterday evening as part of the T2F Cinema for Change series. It traces a day in the life of Bindiya and the legal, social, and cultural challenges that the Khwaja Sirra community faces in Pakistan.\n\nThe documentary is very well-researched, scripted, filmed, directed and edited. It is sensitively made and highlights the issues that affect an entire segment of our society.\n\nAs an actor and as an activist for her cause, Bindiya is a complete natural. She presents the case of the Khwaja Sirra Community clearly, in simple terms, and yet emphatically.\n\nAll the Khwaja Sirras really want is to be recognized and respected as a third gender. As Bindiya puts it, \u201cthis is the way God made us \u2013 why can\u2019t everyone accept that?\u201d What they need is access to jobs, access to education and respect and affection. Is that really too much to ask for?\n\nSome of the problems that Bindiya highlighted are things none of us have really ever thought about:\n\n 1. Public toilet facilities \u2013 they can\u2019t go into either the Gents or Ladies toilets without someone objecting\n\n 2. Public buses \u2013 since buses are segregated, they are neither welcome in the Ladies\u2019 section, nor in the Gents\u2019 section so they have to travel by rickshaw or taxi which is really an unaffordable form of transport for them. Therefore they stay close to home and rarely venture out.\n\n 3. When they apply for their ID cards, and are asked for their gender, it is only now that \u2018Khwaja Sirra\u2019 has become an acceptable option\n\n 4. Schooling \u2013 they are pulled out of school by parents because of the cruelty and the mocking that they are a target of\n\n 5. Abuse by policemen \u2013 they are picked up on suspicion of all sorts of crimes and even when most of them are innocent, they are released only when palms are greased.\n\nThe documentary highlights all these issues and makes a plea for understanding, fairness and the right to education, employment and health services for the Khwaja Sirra.\n\nWe need to ask ourselves why it is that we as a society mock anyone or anything that does not conform with our perception of what is \u201cnormal\u201d. Why is it that we hate and fear anyone whom we do not understand? The film leads us to question our lack of compassion and respect for human beings who do not fit into the moulds that we as a society have created.\n\nThe Question & Answer session was intense with most people offering their help in one way or another. However, even some of the offers of help showed people\u2019s lack of understanding of what was needed. One of the doctors present offered medical help to \u201cfix\u201d all the Khwaja Sirras who wanted to be normal. The question that popped into my mind was \u2018Why try and fix something that ain\u2019t broke?\u2019 Bindiya answered this question by saying that they were happy being who they were and why couldn\u2019t the rest of us just be happy for them instead of wanting to turn them into something they were not supposed to be.\n\nThere was a suggestion that Women\u2019s groups should attach the Khwaja Sirra cause to their cause thus adding momentum to the efforts of both. Sections of the audience were of the opinion that the Khwaja Sirra should try for representation in Parliament so that their views can be considered and their rights protected.\n\nOne person suggested that community schools should earmark some schools for the education of the Khwaja Sirra. I don\u2019t understand why inclusivity and integration cannot be the suggested course of action instead of segregation \u2013 Schools for women, schools for the visually challenged, schools for the hearing impaired, schools for the Khwaja Sirra, schools for the mentally challenged, schools for the elite, schools for the poor.\n\nHow are we going to develop a society where people understand and accept each other \u2013 and no, not just tolerate (I hate that word!) anyone who is different, if we continue to start special schools for anyone who is not like \u2018us\u2019. Let us provide education for every sector of our population through integration. Sure it will initially be a challenge (just as it was when African-Amercians were integrated with the whites in the US) but we have to begin some time. We have to start teaching the coming generations that it is okay to be different, that we can have our own way of life, our own beliefs and that others can have theirs. And the sooner we start doing that, the better.\n\nWell done Ragni for creating a brilliant production! I am extremely proud of your achievement, of the person you are, of your sensitivity and your compassion and of your talent. Keep it up! I hope that through the awareness that you have created, and no doubt will continue to create, Bindiya will find the courage to continue her struggle for the rights of her community.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Bindiya Chamkay Gi"},

It was spread out and far away from the mad city rush and the modern and extensive shopping malls that Dubai is well known for. In fact it cost around Dhs. 50 to get from the Etisalat Academy to the city centre \u2013 which is possibly indicative of the distance.\n\nAs I walked around the grounds of the Etisalat Academy, my thoughts went back to a place called Matahari Island which is two hours by speed boat from Jakarta in Indonesia. It reminded me of Matahari Island without quite being like it.\n\nI think it was in the early nineties that Macromedia Inc, which Enabling Technologies represented as a Distributor, held its Annual Retreat on Matahari Island. Having landed in Jakarta, we were all pushed onto speedboats and taken to this island two hours away. The water was quite choppy and some of the delegates threw up on the way there.\n\nOnce there, we were each given a cottage in which we were to live during our stay. There was a dining hall where we met for all our meals and there was a sort of conference hall where we had all our meetings. I remember that in order to use our computers and the multimedia projection system during the business sessions, the power in all the cottages had to be shut off first :-)\n\nOne could swim, dive and jog but other than that, there were no other distractions \u2013 no shops, no post office, nothing. You couldn\u2019t even buy a postcard. Having lived all my life in a place like Hong Kong, I was totally traumatised. They wanted us to focus on getting to know each other and trying out the range of Macromedia products. We were also there to brainstorm and develop worldwide marketing and positioning strategies.\n\nSince there was no escape, we did settle down to the task at hand. It was a very relaxing, unstressful and beautiful location \u2013 totally unspoilt by the modernity that had already begun to creep into most cities and tourist resorts in the region.\n\nAs I said, Etisalat Academy was not quite Matahari Island as in the evenings we hopped onto coaches and went for dinner to places like the Sheraton but somehow my first glimpse of the place brought back memories of the Macromedia Retreat that we were a part of more than a decade ago.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Deja vu"},

Cook, Chief Operating Officer at Apple, disclosed during Apple\u2019s conference call to discuss their fourth quarter earnings that they estimate 250,000 of the 1.4 Million iPhones that have been sold were bought by people intending to unlock the phone. \u2018The elasticity in demand with the price drop enabled us to far surpass our expectation of hitting around a million units cumulatively by the end of the quarter. Some number of these were sold to people that have an intention to unlock and [while] we don\u2019t know precisely how many people are doing that, our current guess is there is probably 250,000 of the 1.4 million that we sold where people had bought them with the intention of doing that. Many of those happened after the price cut.\u2019 Apple knows how many iPhones have been sold and how many have been activated with ATT. The difference is the number that are unlocked.\u201d\n\n250,000 is a large number! And now Orange has announced that they will officially sell unlocked phones in France. So how does this work? Won\u2019t that mean that Apple iPhone software will have to support these unlocked phones if they are sold officially, hence making a mockery of the likes of ATT and other partners in markets where the iPhone is tied to only one telco?\n\nOh don\u2019t get me wrong.

They have now been evangelising Low Power Radio in India for some years and have even helped to set up village stations where the village people have been producing their own programs.\n\nAlthough Community Radio is something that will not take off in Pakistan until we can convince PEMRA that low power stations are a great means of communication and empowerment for the rural areas, I was glad to see that campus radio was beginning to take off with the Punjab University, the Peshawar University, Szabist and Karachi University applying for licenses.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Szabist have got their license yet but KU has had it for over a year and in fact PEMRA have warned them that if they do not launch the station soon, their license might be cancelled.\n\nSo what is the delay? Apparently they are waiting for the Institute of Mass Communication building to be complete. The construction has been in the works for about 15 years or so and millions of rupees have been spent on it.\n\nWater and electricity is the problem it seems. With the amount of money that they have received from the Feroze Ahmed Trust, the HEC, etc. it is really surprising why the project is in a go-slow mode. Students have in fact received training from Radio Pakistan as well but the wait continues \u2026.\n\nAs for Szabist, that is apparently a political issue.\n\nMy take on all this is that first of all the license fee for campus radio is too high, and secondly, why should the entire process be so difficult? Creating radio programming requires creativity and passion more than it does money. Why can\u2019t the transmission of KU begin from the main campus and shift to this \u201cwhite elephant\u201d if it is ever complete.

I suddenly developed very high fever, couldn\u2019t hold anything down \u2013 not even water and medicine. I struggled with this state for 5 \u2013 6 days before my doctor advised me to go get a saline drip. He said it sounded as if I was losing too much fluid.\n\nSo I went to the emergency room of the hospital closest to me \u2013 the AKU \u2013 where I was told that I couldn\u2019t be given a drip simply because I wanted one. I asked to see the doctor on duty so he/she could attend to me but was told that the Emergency room was full and that I would have to wait 3 to 4 hours.\n\nI felt I would die if I had to wait that long so I phoned my friend Afia who asked me to head for the National Medical Centre where she would arrange for a doctor friend to organize a drip. On reaching NMC, I was attended to very quickly. I was given a saline drip as well as medicine to stop the vomitting. While I was there, they took a complete blood count and discovered that my platelet count had gone down from 150,000 to 85,000 in 24 hours. By then other friends \u2013 Rukhsana, Zak, Nuzhat, Ghazala, etc. had gathered around me and a joint decision was made to move me to OMI where I would be admitted until the platelet count was brought under control. I resisted a bit asking why I couldn\u2019t just go home but of course no-one was listening.\n\nAt OMI, Dr. Tasneem Ahsan diagnosed me with classic Dengue fever. Whenever we read about any epidemic in the paper, or hear about it on radio or television, we never associate it with happening to us. It is always associated with someone else \u2013 especially when the numbers being quoted are 560 out of a city of millions. Well, it did happen to me \u2013 as it did to Erum (of Alchemy) last year. Maybe Jawwad Farid breeds the dengue mosquito. Should I sue him do you think? Naah he is a nice guy.\n\nDengue (pronounced den\u2019 gee) is a disease caused by any one of four closely related viruses (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, or DEN-4). The viruses are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. The main symptoms are high fever, nausea, vomitting and intense pain. Platelet count drops to an extent whereby haemorrhaging can occur hence monitoring of the platelet count is extremely important.\n\nI have been in hospital many times but never as a patient. I had spent weeks and months in various hospitals with my mother when she was ailing and needed attention. I must admit now that being a patient yourself is very different from being a caregiver. I felt absolutely traumatized and at the mercy of doctors and nurses.\n\nFrom the hospital clothes (which appear to be designed to take away ones self respect), to the umpteen needles, to the total handing over of control of yourself to other people, it is the scariest experience I have ever had. I am a person who has always taken care of others. This was the first time that I had no control at all, and I felt completely helpless. I understood now what my mother must have felt all those times she was in hospital.\n\nI had tried to make her as comfortable as possible \u2013 just as all these people were trying to do for me \u2013 my friends, my father, the hospital staff but hospitals just aren\u2019t any fun \u2013 and the sooner one is out of them, the better.\n\nSimple things like the value of being able to use both hands was brought home to me when one of my hands was out of commission due to the drip and the canola.\n\nI have loads of people to thank for making my hospital stay bearable:\n\n 1. Dr. Ghazala Aziz who insisted I go to OMI rather than agree to being admitted to NMC\n\n 2. My old school friends Afia and Rukhsana who took charge and wouldn\u2019t even allow my rudeness to discourage them from taking care of me.\n\n 3. Afia\u2019s daughter Farieha, my friends Zak, Nuzhat and Naheed \u2013 all of whom took turns staying with me. I was not allowed to be alone for even a few minutes.\n\n 4. Jawwad, Fawzia & Uzma \u2013 for the huge cartons of juices, crackers, cheese and olives which provided variety to the cuisine\n\n 5. Barrister Shahida Jamil for the lovely flowers you see above\n\n 6. My siblings and friends who called from all corners of the globe many times\n\n 7. The many friends and family members who phoned, emailed, visited and brought flowers to keep me in good cheer (especially in the absence of wifi connectivity) and of course my father who worried and prayed constantly for me to get back to good health.\n\nI am now back home in the comfort of my own room, resting and rebuilding my strength. The withdrawal symptoms of being kept away from my Apple MacBook Pro and my internet connection, are fading away. Hopefully in a few days I will be back to normal.

Moans and groans about everything from the state of the roads to the state of business and education and the quality of food in restaurants. I guess I must be guilty of it too. Such things are contagious. But guys what about the good things? There must be some, right? I remember as I was growing up, my parents always said that we should be grateful for the things we had instead of yearning for that which we didn\u2019t. That was very sound advice.\n\nSo how come we don\u2019t share the good things that happen to us? Is it because they are not newsworthy? Or is it that we are so busy surrounding ourselves with discontent that we don\u2019t even notice when sunshine creeps through the cracks. Let\u2019s break this mould of negativity for heaven\u2019s sake \u2013 I\u2019ll begin!\n\nLast week I had a couple of experiences that made me feel good about being a part of the IT industry in Pakistan. Actually that is not quite true. The last few weeks and months have been full of exciting stories \u2013 Scrybe, Orgoo, PixSense, Five Rivers, AboutUs.org to name just a few. So I should not have been surprised I guess.\n\nWhat the hell am I talking about? Well, the first thing that happened was that I was asked by Jawwad Farid of Alchemy Technologies (yes him again! \u2013 he seems to keep hogging the limelight on this blog, doesn\u2019t he?) to sit in on Alchemy\u2019s Board meeting. I must admit I was surprised and felt extremely honoured because board meetings are meant to be very confidential and hush-hush \u2013 a place where the management is torn to shreds, hard facts faced and decisions made for the future.\n\nWell, this meeting was different and I am glad I sat in on it \u2013 they went through the figures, the addition of board members, giving away stake in the company to additional members of the senior team, pay scale rises, etc etc. What made me feel good was that this young company had not only met its growth targets for the year ahead of schedule but it was now headed for accelerated growth. It was also sharing the fruits of its success with the development, domain and customer service teams.\n\nMore importantly, it was keeping its core group together by showing its appreciation for their contribution and taking them along on the exciting journey that they have now embarked on after having been through the rollercoaster ride. I tell you it was absolutely exhilirating. Warmed my heart. Good luck Jawwad, Fawzia, Mujtaba, Arif \u2013 and all the rest of the Alchemy team. Here, in Jawwad\u2019s own words, is how it all began.\n\nThat same afternoon I met with another young man \u2013 Kubair Shiraze, CEO of Ikonami, a London-based company with a development arm in Islamabad. They are a Human Capital Management (HCM) systems and services provider. They help customers transform themselves through technology, enabling human capital through Talent, Learning and Team Performance Management products and services as well as Workforce Compliance and Workforce Planning and Management processes. One of their major clients in the .\n\nAs Kubair explained how he had started Ikonami and built it into a successful IT company, I was impressed with his level of confidence and understanding of the market in which he worked, and of the challenges that needed to be overcome if we in Pakistan are to continue and accelerate the growth or our sector.\n\nStrange how he started the company though. He was working for a firm in the UK and was obviously doing well. His British boss told him that he was restricting his talents and his potential by staying where he was and arranged for him to move to another firm where he had more opportunity to show what he could do. As the company grew and made more and more money, the guy who owned it decided to split it up between seven of the key people who were responsible for its success. Ikonami was one of those seven (I hope i have the story right. There may be a few inaccuracies that I am sure Kubair will correct).\n\nMuch as I was impressed by this young man\u2019s success, it was something else that made me sit up and take notice. As Ikonami\u2019s development office in Islamabad has grown, Kubair has realized that there are a few areas we need to work on in Pakistan \u2013 innovation needs more attention. So he started an Innovation ThinkTank some years ago which meets regularly to discuss new ideas. It started within the company but has now started inviting others from within the IT sector who want to sound out crazy ideas.\n\nThe second project that he is beginning now is the addition of a Human Computer Interaction course at NUST. Professors/Lecturers will be flown in from City University London, of which Kubair himself is an alumnus, to conduct this course. It is Kubair\u2019s belief that HCI has not received enough attention in this country and is an area that needs focus. Instead of waiting or complaining, he has decided to take this initiative himself. Now that\u2019s what I call a man of action! He has also offered to work with P@SHA in any areas of Policy or Education where he can make a difference. So Ashraf and Jawwad get in touch with him \u2013 volunteers are not that easy to come by.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "A silver lining\u00a0\u2026"},

Hashmi launched Green&White 5 months ago, people probably thought he was mad (and he is a bit mad actually!)\n\nHowever, fortunately Osama is one of those positive mad geniuses whom I would stay away from whenever he is in a bad mood ;-), but whose views I generally respect even when he and I are not in agreement about something.\n\nHis vision for Green&White was the creation of a virtual place where CEOs, CTOs, Managers, Interns and Students met frequently and discussed challenges faced by the industry.\n\nWhy? Well, his contention was that as the Pakistani economy grows and old-school thinking is replaced by cutting edge business practices, new challenges crop up. To face this new set of challenges, he figures that \u201cgroup thinking\u201d is what is needed \u2013 to have constructive discourse to try and come up with viable solutions \u2013 in other words \u2018to have Coffee Sessions\u2019.\n\nHas he succeeded? Well, I guess that depends entirely on your definition of success or his. I think the authors of Green&White have done a great job in bringing to the fore a number of issues. There have sometimes been very fiery exchanges \u2013 bystanders could be forgiven for thinking that this would result in these guys never talking to each other again. But they have come back for a ferocious debate on another subject.\n\nStart-ups, too, have been highlighted. Telcos have been ripped apart as have bank services! :-) Sometimes I have been terrified to get in the midst of the exchanges but there has always been something new that Osama or one of the other authors has shared that I personally had not heard of before. It is a good effort and it will only get better if more people actually join the discourse. So why not visit the v.2 Beta release of Green&White? Put on your helmets if you are going to discuss blacklisting employees or companies! Otherwise it is a relatively safe place to hang out.\n\nWell done guys!

You all know Jawwad \u2013 the \u2018evil\u2019 fellow who convinces well-paid executives in multinational software companies to abandon their cushy existence and become struggling entrepreneurs.\n\nOne of the founders of Lootmaar is Adnan Haider whose previous venture was imaGyn, a non-profit medical device company he co-founded in the US.

Prior to this, he actually admits to being a technical specialist at IBM.

First Pixsense, then Scrybe and Five Rivers Technologies and now Islamabad-based Orgoo. Here is what Michael Arrington of TechCrunch has to say about Orgoo, a new startup:\n\nOne thing I really like about Orgoo is their attention to detail. There are a number of examples of this. Users can choose from a number of visual templates and can upload avatars for emails/IM. Any address in an email or IM turns into a link that shows the address in Google Maps via a popup.\n\nThey allow users to create on the fly chat rooms. And they are allowing users to record quick audio or video files and send them via email. Orgoo will offer users 3 GB of storage for free. The service is currently in private alpha testing with a handful of USC students only but will be expanding in the coming weeks to a larger group.\n\nThe two founders, Sean Rad (20) and are students at USC and brought in a seasoned veteran, Michael Kantor, as CEO. The company has raised a small round of angel financing and has just 11 employees (three in California, ).\n\nThere are a number of competitors out there. In addition to the webmail services mentioned above, a number of services have great service-neutral webmail services (see our coverage of Goowy). Foldera, a public company, is also a direct competitor but is yet to launch (Disclosure: I am currently on the board of directors of Foldera).\n\nOrgoo has created a lot with a very small team and next to no financing to date. Their biggest challenge going forward won\u2019t be getting users, but proving that their service is scalable. One of the most common complaints about webmail is speed \u2013 even Gmail and Yahoo, with unlimited resources, have a hard time keeping their services humming. If Orgoo can keep the service flying, they could become very popular very fast.\n\nWell done guys! We are rooting for you!

Many of us know that whenever we try to do our bit to change things around us, we are told that we are wasting our time \u2013 that one person cannot make a difference. Well this one person did!\n\nAnita started her retailing career in 1996 in Brighton England to create a livelihood for herself and her two daughters while her husband Gordon, a poet and a traveller, went off to ride a horse from Buenos Aires to New York City (seriously! I am not kidding! And Anita supported his decision).\n\nThe Body Shop is no ordinary cosmetics business just as Anita Roddick was no ordinary woman. In her autobiography, Body and Soul: Profits with Principles \u2014 The Amazing Success Story of Anita Roddick & The Body Shop, she wrote, \u201cI hate the beauty business. It is a monster industry selling unattainable dreams. It lies. It cheats. It exploits women.\u201d So she and her husband Gordon (yes he came back and joined the business) worked hard to ensure that The Body Shop was different from other cosmetic companies. They wanted the business to be profitable, yet based on solid principles. The idea was to bring values into an industry that was certainly not value-driven, and to create social and environmental change by having a business that was built on the principles of honesty, fairness, respect for the individual and care for the environment.\n\nAnita did not want to deceive women by telling them that moisturising cream from The Body Shop would shed years off their faces. Her products were never positioned as miracle treatment for the skin or hair. It is probably the only cosmetic chain that never used beautiful and glamourous women to market its products.\n\nBags and trucks from The Body Shop carried social messages regarding the saving of the rainforests, saving the whales, putting an end to animal testing, campaigns against dumping hazardous waste, awareness regarding AIDS and Violence against women. The Body Shop also supported movements like Amnesty International and Green Peace long before it became fashionable to do so.\n\nAnita Roddick was a brilliant entrepreneur \u2013 but an entrepreneur with a conscience. She did not believe in mediocrity. She worked with a passion and proved beyond doubt that companies can make lots of money and yet be socially conscious. She inspired a lot of women \u2013 and men \u2013 through her hard work, her compassion and her ethics. I don\u2019t think I would be accused of exaggerating if I say that she changed the face of business \u2013 in fact re-defined it.\n\nAnita suffered a brain haemorrage yesterday. She was 64. She had revealed earlier this year that she contracted Hepatitis C thirty five years ago during a blood transfusion. This resulted in liver damage. She was a courageous woman, a shining star who lived each day as if it were her last. She leaves behind millions of admirers. Rest in peace Anita.

I like the fact that there are a variety of colours available \u2013 pink, lime green, blue, silver, white (well white is not really a colour), black, graphite.\n\nWhat is the harm in it? No-one is pushing pink (or is it hot pink?) down our throats. We don\u2019t have to buy any colour that doesn\u2019t appeal to us. I agree with the guy who says that if these products were only available in black and grey, then some women would complain that there weren\u2019t any women-friendly colours available.\n\nWhy take up these non-issues? And why assume that the hot pink was targeted at women alone (although we all know it was) \u2013 I know some men who prefer the hot pink ipods \u2013 no names will be mentioned here :-) And what about the new red iPod nanos?

After reading every one of these emails, I have some observations and conclusions. First, I am sure that we are making the correct decision to lower the price of the 8GB iPhone from $599 to $399, and that now is the right time to do it. iPhone is a breakthrough product, and we have the chance to \u2018go for it\u2019 this holiday season. iPhone is so far ahead of the competition, and now it will be affordable by even more customers. It benefits both Apple and every iPhone user to get as many new customers as possible in the iPhone \u2018tent\u2019. We strongly believe the $399 price will help us do just that this holiday season.\n\nSecond, being in technology for 30+ years I can attest to the fact that the technology road is bumpy. There is always change and improvement, and there is always someone who bought a product before a particular cutoff date and misses the new price or the new operating system or the new whatever. This is life in the technology lane. If you always wait for the next price cut or to buy the new improved model, you\u2019ll never buy any technology product because there is always something better and less expensive on the horizon.\n\nThe good news is that if you buy products from companies that support them well, like Apple tries to do, you will receive years of useful and satisfying service from them even as newer models are introduced.\n\nThird, even though we are making the right decision to lower the price of iPhone, and even though the technology road is bumpy, we need to do a better job taking care of our early iPhone customers as we aggressively go after new ones with a lower price. Our early customers trusted us, and we must live up to that trust with our actions in moments like these. Therefore, we have decided to offer every iPhone customer who purchased an iPhone from either Apple or AT&T, and who is not receiving a rebate or any other consideration, a $100 store credit towards the purchase of any product at an Apple Retail Store or the Apple Online Store. Details are still being worked out and will be posted on Apple\u2019s website next week. Stay tuned. We want to do the right thing for our valued iPhone customers.

Well, I was invited to a candidate dissection session at Alchemy Technologies yesterday morning after my meeting with my friend Jawwad Farid.\n\nI hesitated before accepting. It sounded like it would be brutal and I am a gentle soul. However, Jawwad can be very convincing so I found myself amidst a cross-section of team members from Alchemy.\n\nApparently, they had just finished interviewing a young man and were now deciding whether to make him an offer. Jawwad sought the opinion of people from the different departments \u2013 the domain experts, the techies, the HR guys, the marketing team, etc. They were very vocal in their assessment. It was felt that the young man was knowledgeable and experienced (although he talked a bit much and strategies would have to be developed to keep the chatter from driving everyone insane).\n\nHe was technically competent, understood the domain, would add value because he was coming from the customer side of things, wanted to be continually challenged and appeared to be a team player. His personality was discussed as was his staying power. If he could have stayed in his previous job for 3 years \u2013 mundane as it was \u2013 it was felt that since he had turned down a few similar lucrative positions, he was on the lookout for an environment where he would be challenged and would have an opportunity to learn. He felt a small tech shop was more likely to provide that than a large multinational. Smart kid!\n\nEveryone was in agreement that he should be \u201cprocured\u201d right away as each department felt he would add value to their efforts and also that he had the communication skills and knowledge needed to interact with clients. I liked the democratic group decision and naturally wanted to know what was so brutal about this kind of dissection process.\n\nWell, apparently I had been lucky enough to attend a session where the candidate was positively viewed \u2013 it is when this group finds weaknesses in a candidate, things they feel will impact negatively on the work of the company, on the further development of the products and the service they offer their clients, that is when they are absolutely brutal.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Dissection of a\u00a0candidate?"},

He was a family doctor, who first proclaimed World Laughter Day in 1999. Since then the phenomenon of Social Laughter Clubs has exploded.

Fitzgerald thinks that Faizan has figured out something fundamental about how we want access to schedules and related information. Scrybe\u2019s tools include a clever interface that features zooming calendar boxes that become bigger when scrolled over, the ability to print in multiple formats, including wallet- and pocket-friendly versions, and a novel notepad that accepts text and images from the Web as well as the usual typed-in notes.\n\nIt also works offline, something that Outlook and other existing programs cannot do. One user said he had adopted Scrybe because of its interface and because it did a better job of pulling together data than any other calendar he has used. All of this, says Fitzgerald, has made Scrybe, which remains in beta testing, the most anticipated software at the Museum of Modern Betas, a Web site that tracks emerging Web 2.0 projects. More than 300,000 people have watched the Scrybe YouTube video.\n\nWith a PR budget that was nil, they were expecting 10,000 beta users in six months \u2013 they got 100,000 in just a few weeks! Well done guys! You have done us proud! This is just the beginning \u2013 the world has yet to see the many surprises that will come out of cities in Pakistan \u2013 then maybe Pakistan will start being seen as a haven for software entrepreneurs.\n\nFor details, read the NY Times article in full.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Scrybe covered in New York\u00a0Times"},

Dishes in the newly-opened Nuremberg bistro, Baggers, are delivered directly to diners on an elaborate spiral rail network that descends from the second floor kitchen.\n\nThe high-tech system distributes color-coded dishes on miniature train-cars to diners, who scoop them up as they pass by, restaurant owner Michael Mack said yesterday.\n\n\u201cThe system is the only one of its kind,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concept will revolutionise the food industry.\u201d Guests\u2019 orders are placed via touch-screen computers, and there are no waiters.

Personally I find it really rivetting \u2013 of course that might be because I was a debater in school and college and it brings back wonderful memories. The host of 30:30 is very professional and does a great job. I wonder what his background is.\n\nSome of the guests on the show take to it quite like ducks to water, but others face some problems. Why so? Well, the basic concept of the show is that there is a theme for each episode \u2013 the two guests hold differing points of view. They make opening statements after which each one conveys his viewpoint or responds to the others\u2019 question or remark in 30 seconds. It is the 30 seconds that is a problem because we seem to have difficulty in saying anything in less than several minutes.\n\nAnway, to get to the point (see what i mean about us Pakistanis going on and on!) a couple of days ago, the theme of 30:30 was the traffic jams in Karachi. The guests on the show were none other than the City Nazim of Karachi, Syed Mustafa Kamal and Mr. Hamid Maker, the Chairman of Helpline Trust (an NGO that has been very vocal in agitating for citizen and consumer rights). I don\u2019t need to tell you who was on the hot seat! :)\n\nHamid had prepared himself very well and presented his case very professionally. What I was most impressed with in the case of Hamid Maker was that he was able to put forward his strongest points without being rude. It is amazing how much one can get done if one doesn\u2019t make the other person feel that one is on a witchhunt.\n\nMustafa Kamal too must be complimented on accepting the faults with his administration and being open to suggestions on improving the system. He answered all the questions posed to him and didn\u2019t try and evade even the most difficult of queries \u2013 something one doesn\u2019t really expect from most politicians.\n\nWhat came out during the discussions was no surprise to anyone who watched the show. Karachi is run by 13 different bodies. In addition to that, the traffic police do not come under the authority of the city government. So whereas the pending construction work in non-cantonment and DHA areas and the lack of sufficient public transport are the responsibility of the city government, the traffic police are not. Nonetheless, apparently CDGK is working with the police authorities to try and ensure better traffic management. 300 CNG buses have actually arrived in Karachi and will be on the roads soon. I wonder how much this will add to the congestion but there is no denying that more public transport is a necessity.\n\nCongratulations to Dawn News on a brilliant show.

{"url": "https://jehanara.wordpress.com/2007/08/26/awakened-to-the-power-of-the-military-economy/", "text": "I am one of those people who had never really thought about the economic involvement or economic might of the military in Pakistan until yesterday. I was awoken from my ignorance at an event sponsored by Oxford University Press at The Second Floor yesterday evening.\n\nDr. Ayesha Siddiqa, author of Military Inc. \u2013 Inside Pakistan\u2019s Military Economy, was the chief guest. She was there to talk about her book \u2013 the background, the research, the possible solutions to the problems she had highlighted in Military Inc., and the reaction from various quarters. As expected, the event was packed to capacity \u2013 and included people like Wajid Jawwad (former Chairman of EPB), Asad Umar (head of Engro), Tammy Ayesha Haq (of Business Plus), loads of media people \u2013 prominent among them Ardeshir Cowasjee, Ghazi Salahuddin and Asif Noorani and the Dawn News team. The surprise visitor in my view was Zafar Khan, the new Chairman of PIA. Apparently he is also a key member of the Pakistan Fellowship Foundation that sponsored Ayesha Siddiqa\u2019s visit to the United States to carry out research on the subject. Also present were young media practitioners, teachers, researchers, writers, doctors and other people from civil society. Very good turnout.\n\nMilitary Inc. digs into the vast and expansive empire that the Pakistani Military has set up in Pakistan over the past 6 decades.\n\nThe central argument of the book is that `Milbus\u2019 (combining the words military and business) perpetuates the military\u2019s political predatory style, resulting in the military\u2019s influence in all aspects of Pakistani society. Profit, says Dr. Siddiqa, is directly proportionate to power and that this is both a cause and effect of a non-democratic political system.\n\n`Milbus\u2019 is defined by Ayesha Siddiqa as military capital used for the personal benefit of the military fraternity and their cronies. It refers to all activities that transfer resources from the state to an individual, a group or a company within the military or set up by the military. She says that these activities do not figure in the defence budget nor are they subject to the normal accountability procedures of the state. They are either directly controlled by the military or enjoy its patronage.\n\nAlthough the beneficiaries are primarily senior military officers, both serving and retired, Ayesha Siddiqa says that the `Milbus\u2019 benefits a wider circle of civilian businessmen and politicians who have supported it for their own personal gain.\n\nShe says that industries run by military or ex-military officials include steel mills, sugar factories, cement factories, gas stations, boot manufacturing companies, fertilizer factories, cereal factories, banks, logistics companies, construction companies and utility companies.\n\nSome of those present at the event shared stories about how military enterprises had impacted adversely on different types of businesses. There were questions on possible ways to send the military back to the barracks and to expunge them from the economy of the country so as to reduce the excessive influence that they exert on all aspects of Pakistani society.\n\nMost people at the event were not anti-army. However, they were all in agreement that the army should focus on what they were set up to do rather than involve themselves in other activities of the state. According to the author/researcher, politicians, businessmen and civil society needed to take responsibility for the state of affairs that existed and needed to start a movement that would change the status quo if Pakistan is to take the first steps towards becoming a democratic state.\n\nFor me the evening was educational as well as scary. I guess there are many like me who are a-political and subconsciously close their eyes to the realities that exist around them. Maybe we should be more involved if we would like to see things change.\n\nKudos to the courage of the author Ayesha Siddiqa for taking on this task, to the Pakistan Fellowship Foundation for supporting it, to OUP for publishing the book against all odds and to The Second Floor for organizing yesterday\u2019s event (and providing free food and drink \u2013 the lemon tarts were superb). Apparently, when the author and OUP tried to launch the book in Islamabad, there were all sorts of hurdles that kept her from doing so.

I am not really a Pakistani or Indian film fan although I used to watch some of the Indian Art flims and classics with my mother. I rather liked those.\n\nSo why did I accept Sajid\u2019s invitation? For a couple of reasons. First of all Sajid is a nice guy and I considered it an honour and a privilege to be included in this Etilize outing. Secondly, I had heard a lot about this film and I was a little curious about all the hype.\n\nWhen I got to the Cineplex at Seaview I met up with a lot of the young people who work at Etilize. Sajid had booked the entire cinema hall \u2013 the group included mostly Etilize staff, their families and some guests. It was nice to see the head of one of our major IT companies making an effort to bring the staff together in a non-work environment. Having fun outside of work helps bring teams closer together.\n\nAnyway, let us get to the film. I must admit it was different from what I had imagined a Pakistani film to be. So much for preconceived notions! The movie has been well produced, the cinematography, the music and the acting is good too and some parts of the script are absolutely brilliant.\n\nI didn\u2019t like the storyline too much, but then that\u2019s me. I always want a happy ending so the male lead star ending up maimed and the female lead star opting to live on her own on the borders of Afghanistan and run a girls\u2019 school rather than go back to London and restart her life, is not my idea of an acceptable ending.\n\nThe movie addresses the misconception propagated by some leading Maulvis that beards, form of dress, hatred of anything that is \u2018different\u2019 and so-called jihad are what Islam is all about. The misleading of the youth of this country in the name of religion and the status of women in Islam, are also addressed. Khuda kay liye is a film that is very different from the \u2018normal\u2019 popular form of Pakistani or Indian film. It addresses real issues; it doesn\u2019t have dance sequences; the music is not the main event \u2013 the script is; Clothes, jewellery and glamour are not the focus.\n\nThere are parts of the movie that don\u2019t appeal to me but overall I think Shoaib Mansoor has done a wonderful job.

Yesterday morning I got to Makro at around 9 a.m. There were very few people around so I quickly got the stuff I needed and made a beeline for the check-out counter that had no queue. There was a young lady at the counter who asked if I had a Makro card. This is a standard question posed to me each time I shop there. Usually they just say okay and proceed to check you out.\n\nYesterday was different though. She told me that without a Makro card number she could not proceed with the transaction. It would take a minute to get my \u201cdetails\u201d and I would have a card. I guess it would have been easiest to just give her the information and proceed.\n\nHowever, I wasn\u2019t in a mood to be forced into having yet another card made for no apparent reason. So I asked this young lady what the advantages were to having a Makro card. She looked confused so I elaborated. \u201cIn other countries if you apply for a store card, you get something in return. It entitles you to a discount or it\u2019s a stored value card or something of that sort.\u201d She thought about this and said that the Makro card entitled the customer to nothing like that. So I asked her again why I should want to have one.\n\nPoor kid \u2013 it wasn\u2019t her fault and I felt sorry for making her life difficult (actually it was nice to see so many young women working in different positions in the store) but I was trying to make a point. If Makro has a card for which they want customers to provide information about themselves, then in exchange for this information they should be providing a service. Why should my \u201cdetails\u201d be freely available to them or anyone else? Why have a card if there was no perceived advantage/value to the customer? Are they trying to restrict the number of customers who walk through their doors?\n\nAnyway, the young lady went off to several of her colleagues and supervisors and I could imagine her saying to them that there was this argumentative woman asking all sorts of difficult questions and refusing to apply for a card (she needed my National ID Card to complete the registration \u2013 I asked her why I should be out on a Sunday with my ID card \u2013 although I did have it in my wallet). The saga ended when she came back and checked me out without another word.\n\nIt was only when I got home that I noticed that, in order to bypass the problem, she had been asked to use the ID of Ashraf General Stores whoever they are. Absolutely ridiculous! Shouldn\u2019t the management of Makro think things through before trying to implement a policy such as this? Or is the customer just supposed to roll over and play dead because they say so?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Makro needs to think things\u00a0through"},

It was comfortable. I watched a movie, started and finished a book I had bought to read on the flight, chatted with the guy sitting next to me \u2013 a young British advertising guy who was a bit anxious about coming to Karachi for the first time to sign a partnership deal with an agency in Karachi. I think I managed to convince him that he would be okay, that Karachi and its people were wonderful and he would enjoy himself here.\n\nThe past two weeks in Hong Kong have been wonderful for me \u2013 reliving old memories, rediscovering old haunts, sampling the delicious cuisine, taking in some of the new movies and discovering and experiencing the new things that Hong Kong has to offer.\n\nWhat will I miss most about Hong Kong? Everything! But most of all, the walking I did. Would you believe that I have lost 6 lbs in 2 weeks \u2013 no dieting involved (as can be seen through the various entries on this blog). That wasn\u2019t the purpose of the walking. I just wanted to roam around but the end result is that I lost weight and I feel good.\n\nI identify Hong Kong with liberation \u2013 the liberty to just step out of the house and be in the midst of things. It is that kind of city. Whether you walk, take the bus, the MTR, the tram, the ferry or a taxi, you are always in the center of things \u2013 the buzz surrounds you. You can be yourself. No-one bothers you. You are just one more person in a mass of humanity \u2013 everyone going about their own business or socializing or shopping, partying \u2013 whatever their hearts desire.\n\nPut on a pair of jeans, throw on a blouse, put your feet into a comfortable pair of shoes and off you go. It is just so easy and so relaxing. For two weeks I didn\u2019t make any plans. I just did what I wanted to, when I wanted to. It was amazing.

There were a few things I needed to get but, as often happens when I go to any of the major computer plazas in this city, I spent far more time there than I needed to.\n\nIn the evening my brother had invited my father and me for high tea at the Kowloon Shangrila Hotel in Tsimtsatsui East. High tea included amongst other things scones with clotted cream and jam (yumm), sandwiches, fried fish, dim sum of various kinds, cakes galore, chicken wings, fried noodles, fruit, etc.\n\nI must admit I hogged on the scones and clotted cream. Hadn\u2019t had them for so long. Classic English high tea could never be imagined possible without the inclusion of scones & clotted cream. It is one of the things Hong Kong has adopted as a tradition even though it no longer remains a British colony.\n\nThe Kowloon Shangrila is an award winning hotel well known for its combination of luxury, warmth and unmatched service. It is always a pleasure to go to any Shangrila property in Asia but this one is a little more special than the rest.\n\nWe had taken a cab to Kowloon because we felt the walk might be too much for my father to cope with, but on the way back we decided to come back by MTR. Thank God for the common sense of the MTR officials. It is a long walk from Tsimtsatsui East station to the trains. Normally it would have been impossible for an 82 year old to muster up the energy to walk that far, but because of the walking escalators, we had a comfortable trip back.\n\nI wish public transportation could be made this easy in Karachi.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Sunday jaunt"},

Maybe this was one of the reasons the MTR in Hong Kong launched the \u201cArt in the MTR\u201d Initiative in 1998. This initiative has taken many forms and continues to grow in ways that they hadn\u2019t really envisaged in the early days of the program.\n\nI remember the first time I went to Chicago. The art all around me, from the moment I landed at the airport, made me feel so wonderful. Why can\u2019t we provide such simple pleasures for our communities in Pakistan and instil in them the value of art and culture? Why can\u2019t our companies, large and small, take CSR to the masses \u2013 in the areas of art, culture, health and education? I know some companies are working in the health and education sectors but much more needs to be done \u2013 in a variety of innovative ways.\n\nHere are some examples of what is happening in the MTR stations in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\n The open art gallery aims to improve the travelling environment by exhibiting drawings of renowned artists at various MTR stations. It features 14 reproductions of paintings by renowned Hong Kong artists in 13 stations, each presenting a different aspect of local life and culture. In addition, three giant photographs depicting Hong Kong\u2019s natural habitat have been displayed at Kwun Tong Station since 1999.\n\n\n\n Located at the entrance to Central Station, the \u201carttube\u201d is a mini art gallery created to provide a platform for aspiring artists, designers and talented individuals in the creative industries to showcase their works.\n\nSince its inception in December 2003, the \u201carttube\u201d has hosted numerous exhibitions of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional art creations.\n\n\u201cArttube\u201d is expected to help groom emerging artists, enhance public interest in the visual arts, and provide the public with yet another opportunity to appreciate the artistic talents and cultural heritage of Hong Kong.\n\n\n\n In February 2000, the two footbridges adjoining Lam Tin Station (in the Newcommunity galleries Territories area) were converted into a community art gallery for the display of paintings and drawings by students from schools or artists from local groups in the Lam Tin area.\n\nFollowing this success, community art galleries have been extended to other stations. There are now a total of 36 such galleries in the MTR system. All have become highly popular.\n\n\n\n The \u201croving art\u201d programme features temporary art exhibitions at various MTR stations. Organisations in proximity to MTR stations are invited to exhibit their artwork. The aim of the programme is to promote community art by providing a venue for local artists to showcase their works.\n\n\n\n By staging live musical and theatrical performances at MTR stations, the living art programme adds an interactive dimension into the \u201cart in mtr\u201d Initiative.living art\n\nStarting in October 2004, the Central Subway of Hong Kong Station has been converted into a stage for professional artists and amateur performers to demonstrate their artistic talents to the public. Performances are held every Friday evening from 6:00 p.m. to 6:45 p.m.. Passengers can relax and take a break from the stress and pressure of city life.\n\n\n\n The art in station architecture programme was introduced in 1998 when the Airport Railway commenced service. In addition to contemporary art pieces being installed at MTR and Airport Express (this is the train that runs between Hong Kong and the airport) stations, artworks are also incorporated into the actual design of station architecture.\n\nAt present, 29 art pieces have been introduced at various stations as part of the station architecture.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "CSR and Art"},

This morning started out quite sedately with visits to the Australian Consulate (my father wanted to apply for a multiple entry visa because my sister lives in Australia) and the Pakistan Consulate (my father and I were paying a courtesy visit to the Consul General). It was pouring when we left the house. We took a cab because my father can\u2019t really walk very long distances without tiring.\n\nWell, the visit to the Aussies bombed out when my father was told that the elderly were no longer given multiple entry visas and that if a person was over 80 he needed to have a medical done even for a single entry visa. Until now my father had always managed to get 4 year multiple entry visas for Australia. Last year he only got a year\u2019s visa because of the validity of his passport. Anyway, you can\u2019t argue with bureaucrats so we gave up and headed for the Pakistan Consulate where we had coffee and biscuits with the Consul General and discussed the potential for IT growth in Pakistan, the education system, the economy, politics, etc etc. He said he had heard that we were in town and was waiting for us to call on him. Just as well we did then :-)! My father is very correct about these things.\n\nFrom the Consulate we returned home because it\u2019s Friday and he had to go to the mosque for prayers. I, on the other hand, headed out for Pacific Place. I couldn\u2019t leave this city without having a proper cantonese meal with dim sum so I headed straight for a Cantonese restaurant. Had my fill of more seafood chinese style and ventured out to the task at hand \u2013 more shopping!\n\nI had been pondering on the efficiency of the Chinese as I left the restaurant. In an hour I had seen them serve hundreds of people with such speed and expertise, resetting places and filling them up again with new customers. I was thinking what would happen if a restaurant in Karachi had to serve so many people at any given time \u2013 refilling pots of chinese tea, serving dim sum and loads of a la carte items that customers ordered.\n\nAs I pondered on that, I suddenly noticed that the lights in the shops were being turned off, the shutters being pulled down, and the entire population of the city was heading home. In minutes it seemed the city was shutting down. Confused, I looked around and noticed that signs had gone up stating that Typhoon Signal Number 8 had been hoisted.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThe typhoon that had left us behind the day before (leading to the removal of all storm warning signals) had actually backtracked and was heading directly for Hong Kong.\n\nIn such cases one is expected to take all precautions \u2013 head straight home, shutter down all doors and windows, disconnect neon boards if you are a neon board owner, not stand near windows, park your car where it is safest, etc etc.\n\nWhile all sensible people were finding the quickest way to get home, I decided to walk home \u2013 take in the atmosphere, see what people were up to. I was on holiday after all and feeling quite adventurous. I had a wee umbrella with me so I thought I would be okay. Maybe I had forgotten what typhoons in Hong Kong can be like.\n\nI even stopped at the Opera Gallery half way home to look at so me paintings in the window. Was grumbling to my brother on the phone about the Hong Kong Observatory creating a panic for no rhyme or reason \u2013 that there weren\u2019t any strong winds or heavy rain. I had barely said that when it started coming down in sheets from all directions. The umbrella wasn\u2019t much use. A raincoat would have been a better bet. These typhoons are so deceptive I tell you. Anyway, I started to walk faster but by the time I got home, I was totally drenched. It had certainly been an eventful day. We are now shuttered in waiting for Typhoon Pabuka to hit land so that we can go back to a normal life.\n\nI hear Karachi has been hit by a storm resulting in heavy rain. I feel for friends and family there because obviously this means flooded roads, power breakdowns and telephone lines going down. Why can\u2019t we get our act together and plan for such emergencies? Why can\u2019t our city infrastructure be fixed to deal with these things?

So I took a break and went to D\u2019Aguilar Street in Central. That is where my office used to be. I thought I would check out the place and see what, if anything, had changed. A lot had of course. Central is the financial and business hub of Hong Kong but at night D\u2019Aguilar Street, which is part of Lan Kwai Fong, totally transforms.\n\nLan Kwai Fong is THE place to be if you are on the lookout for the best restaurants, bars and parties in Asia.

In the old days, and until quite recently, there used to be a Restaurant/Bar called Mad Dogs that served very good food at lunch time. This was on D\u2019Aguilar Street. I thought I would stop for a bite there. But, lo and behold, it had been replaced by the \u201cHeaven on Earth Restaurant & Bar\u201d. Now how could I resist going into a place with such an intriguing name? Just had to check it out. I ordered Sze Chuan prawns and steamed rice. It wasn\u2019t heaven on earth but the food was delicious \u2013 as was the Four Treasures Chinese tea that they served with the food. So I was happy. I am always happy when I have had a good meal :-)\n\nChinese restaurants are not well known for desserts so I stepped out and guess what? Just across the street was Ben & Jerry\u2019s. So I had an ice-cream cone. I am glad I don\u2019t work on D\u2019Aguilar Street anymore. What with Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Haagen Dazs across the street from each other, I would have been twice the size if I had to pass these ice cream parlours several times a day \u2013 coz of course i wouldn\u2019t just pass them.\n\nAfter lunch I continued my shopping spree until i was bogged down with a few shopping bags. Then I walked back to the flat and left the stuff there, rested my feet for 10 minutes and was all ready to get going again when I heard that one of my father\u2019s old Chinese friends was at my brother\u2019s office so I trotted over to the office, which is just down the road, to say hello to him. Wonderful chap. We chatted for a while and I was on the go again.\n\nJumped on the ferry and went off to Ocean Centre. It was lovely on the water and the view was absolutely fabulous. I went to the Star House Computer Arcade first to see if Apple\u2019s iLife 08 or iWork 08 were available. Sadly they were not. So I headed on to Ocean Centre to buy a couple of shoes I had seen and liked. Strolled a bit. The weather was lovely. Then jumped back on the ferry and came back to the Hong Kong side and walked home. It is quite a walk but I have been walking a lot here because I can.

The scanner reads the computer chip embedded in the card, deducts the fare, and flashes the amount of credit remaining. Presto \u2013 the whole transaction takes just a couple of seconds. That is the speed at which Hong Kong moves.\n\nAdvantages of the card: speed, efficiency, convenience, no need to fumble around looking for exact change, a discount is incorporated into the card compared to those who pay cash.\n\nDisadvantages of the card: there is only one that I can think of. If you lose it, you\u2019re lost.\n\n Locals and tourists both use the Octopus card as a matter of course. Once you start it becomes a habit and like the AMEX card, you never leave home without it.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Talk about total adoption of\u00a0technology!"},

Fathers had actually taken time off from work to accompany their wives and kids to the 10 am show (the company tags around their necks were a dead giveaway) \u2013 something that was unthinkable in workaholic fathers in Hong Kong a few years ago.\n\nOne could hear plans being made for lunch so obviously the family time was not over. I guess fathers have begun to understand that time with their kids is important. What is the point of struggling and making money to give your families a good life if you are not part of that life? This applies equally to working moms and dads. If you can\u2019t share in the growing up years of your children because you are busy making a living, what is that struggle for? I have seen how Jawwad Farid takes time off to baby-sit his kids or take them for football practice. That is what should happen more and more.\n\nAnyway, back to the movie! Ratatouille proves yet again that Pixar haven\u2019t lost their touch. They are still the best animation company on the face of this planet. The animation is superb \u2013 absolutely unbeatable. It is a pleasure watching the brilliantly rendered film.\n\nThe storyline is something one would not have thought possible. Remy the rat wanting to be a world class chef \u2013 carrying out his fantasy in a 5 star restaurant in Paris. Only the team of Disney & Pixar could make rodents look real and yet loveable and cuddly. There is a lot of detailed work in the movement and the background illustrations. The music is amazing! It is a family movie that people of all ages can watch. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s light-hearted, it\u2019s cute. It left me smiling, happy and relaxed.\n\nIs there anything missing? Well if you want to be picky, then it is amazing that they apparently didn\u2019t use any French voices although the entire setting is France. The main character Linguini Gusteau speaks like an American and Remy (the chef rat) speaks American too. Strange. Maybe the Pixar and Disney teams think that the French speak American :-).", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Ratatouille \u2013 rat\u00b7a\u00b7too\u00b7ee"},

And yet there are times when we have had to venture there. Today I decided to go check out the Kowloon side.\n\nI took the MTR there (it was only 3 stops on the train from where my brother lives). I roamed around on Nathan Road, Cameron Road and all the connected roads just to take in the changes. Then I went to Oliver\u2019s Super Sandwiches which serves the most sumptuous Baked Potatoes on the planet. Oliver\u2019s is a fast food joint that has been part of the Hong Kong lunch scene since 1981. They serve the best salads, sandwiches and baked potatoes that you can imagine. I had the tuna salad potato which is my favourite. It still tastes as good as I remember. Health food over with, I went down the road and had a banana crepe \u2013 yummm!\n\nThen I strolled down to Hankow Road to look in on Andrew at Echo Photo & Audio. Andrew has been the person that I have bought my camera and audio equipment from for years and years. He is totally reliable, gives the best advice and you can go back to him should there be anything wrong with any product. Never thought Andy would age. Was quite shocked to see him looking frail. His memory is still great though. He recognized me and asked about Captain (that\u2019s Zak who is his favourite customer). We chatted for a while. He said business was slow probably because of the heat. I don\u2019t think he knows what heat really means. The maximum temperature here today was 30 degrees. It rained heavily this morning but that didn\u2019t disrupt anyone\u2019s movements. Everyone was out and about as usual. All day the weather was cool and overcast. Absolutely lovely for walking around.\n\nAfter taking my leave of Andrew I headed for Ocean Centre and Ocean Terminal \u2013 beautiful huge complexes with shops galore. Again, I browsed, oohed and aahed but bought nothing \u2013 I really must be ill ;-) When I started to tire, I headed for Star Ferry. This is the ferry that has, for decades, plied between Hong Kong and Kowloon taking passengers to and fro. I love the ride across the harbour. It costs HK$2.20 (approximately US$0.30). I was horrified coz for years it cost only HK$1.20. Anyway, it is still quite cheap and it is a lovely experience. I sat right in the front so that the breeze could blow through my hair \u2013 blow all the cobwebs away. It reminded me of the company boat we used to have when I was working in Hong Kong \u2013 it was good for entertaining customers and friends at weekends. Used to be on my \u2018favourite things to do\u2019 list when I was living in Hong Kong.\n\nFrom the ferry I observed the skyline \u2013 there was a time, till recently, when the highlights were the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre, the HSBC building and the Bank of China Building. This time I noticed that the latter two buildings which were once the tallest buildings in Hong Kong were actually dwarfed by a glass building that rose into the clouds \u2013 the International Finance Centre \u2013 88 storeys high \u2013 about 1,362 sq ft \u2013 wow! The architect of this wonderful structure is Cesar Pelli. I was so absolutely wowed by this structure that once I disembarked from the ferry, I headed straight for it. It has two towers and the top floors house the Hong Kong Monetary Authority who are said to have paid US$0.48 billion for their office space. It also has 26 trading floors. At peak construction time as many as 3,500 workers from all over the world are supposed to have worked on this building. It\u2019s famous too having appeared in the Hollywood production Tomb Raider 2.\n\nI browsed in some of the shops including Dymocks Book Shop and I noticed that they house a cinema hall , the Four Season Hotel and they have vast amounts of exhibition space. They also have the first Ben & Jerrys ice-cream parlour in the complex. Now what more could one want!", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Venturing across the\u00a0harbour"},

The square was built at the end of the 19th century \u2013 and originally housed the statue of Queen Victoria amongst others. The statue has since been moved to Victoria Park in Causeway Bay.\n\nOn weekdays Statue Square is a busy place where people often relax during their lunch breaks or sit by the fountains. On Sundays, however, the place comes alive. Filipina domestic workers who moved to Hong Kong in the 70s and 80s, and number around 180,000, congregate in Statue Square and the areas surrounding it on Sundays to meet with friends and relatives. They have picnics and parties, they sing and dance, they buy and sell goods and generally have a good time. They catch up with each other, speak their own language and enjoy a sense of community. Two access roads to Statue Square are actually blocked off to traffic on Sundays because of this mass congregation. It has become such a Hong Kong fixture that the HongKong Tourist Association now mentions it as a tourist attraction.\n\nFilipina migration to Hong Kong started in the \u201970s, when Hong Kong was experiencing an economic boom and the Philippine economy was beginning to hit rock bottom. Housewives in Hong Kong had more opportunities to work to meet increasing economic demands \u2013 and Chinese amahs were expensive. The demand for cheap domestic workers was high. Filipinas filled this demand. As more local women were lured into industrial higher paid jobs, there was a heightened demand for English-speaking Filipinas. They came in droves, making Hong Kong the host city for close to 180,000+ maids. Most of these domestic workers are graduates \u2013 teachers and nurses who couldn\u2019t make a decent income in the Philippines. They came to Hong Kong and sent back much needed money to their parents and younger brothers and sisters back home. They don\u2019t have much of a life other than the work they do in posh homes across Hong Kong and Kowloon. They are very diligent workers and do everything \u2013 cleaning and cooking, washing & ironing, taking care of young children. Sunday offers them a break and Statue Square and the surrounding areas is where they can be found.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Sundays are unique \u2013 especially in Statue\u00a0Square"},

It is one of my favourite places in Hong Kong \u2013 the appropriate place to check out new computer gadgets and of course visit the Mac Stores that are in the Mall. Browse for accessories for my MacBook Pro and iPod \u2013 some things i might really need and can in fact not live without ;-)\n\nA cool karaoke attachment for the iPod beckoned to me and I was absolutely going to buy it. Changed my mind coz I can\u2019t sing to save my life :-).\n\nThere were cool cases for the MacBook and the MacBook Pro- absolutely mouth-wateringly gorgeous \u2013 in all sorts of colours and materials! And Belkin lappockets and cushtops for laptops \u2013 looking sooooo tempting, as was the iLap. Yet again I resisted. Not so sure that I will be able to the next time around. Great accessories for the ipod abound as did flash drives in all shapes and sizes.\n\nFrom Windsor House I went to Jardine\u2019s Bazaar alongwith a sea of humanity \u2013 the picture above will indicate just how many people were out on the roads today. Saturday afternoon is not the best time t0 browse or shop. Everyone and their dog is out and about. To add to the pain and anguish, the temperature was 34 degrees and the humidity was 65%. I was beginning to wilt but I roamed around a bit more, had more bean curd (yumm), went to my favourite bakery and bought some wheat and raisin buns and swiss rolls before heading home.\n\nA disappointing turn to the day took place when I went into the Sogo Department Store (a Japanese chain) and found that the second basement no longer contained the food court that had been there for decades. It was one of the places I used to frequent most because you could have sushi, or noodles, or spaghetti or pancakes or waffles. Most anything you wished to have you could find in this food court.

If you are a fan of the cartoon or the transformer gadgets, then this loud film with car chases and robot fights is just the thing for you. I am not a fan so for me it was more an amazement at what technology has been able to do. The state-of-the-art computer animation is completely convincing and few, if any, prior films have as effectively integrated CGI and live-action characters as is done in this movie.\n\nBut 135 minutes of freeways being demolished, buildings blowing up, entire cities being laid to waste, robots transforming into cars and visa versa (no matter how well it is all done) \u2013 and absolutely no solid story line, is not my idea of good cinema.\n\nWhat was really strange was that where cars were changing into gigantic robots, shouldn\u2019t someone outside of the film\u2019s cast have seen them? There was one scene where the huge robots are all in the young hero\u2019s yard \u2013 and no-one notices! Not his parents, not the neighbours, no-one. They are noisy and disruptive yet no-one but the hero and heroine notice them. Weird!\n\nI think I dozed during some parts of the movie. The cinema hall was a delight. In the midst of Hong Kong Island \u2013 in Pacific Place, it is a very comfortable place to watch a good film.\n\nAfter the movie I went out to see a photo exhibition by Vincent Yu \u2013 scenes of Hong Kong in the past 20 years \u2013 especially the changes during British and Chinese rule. Very nice photos \u2013 all black & white.\n\nI stopped and had coffee and then walked home. It was a half hour walk but I enjoyed it. The weather was cooler, and I wanted to look around the city, the new buildings and parks. Amazing how things have changed and yet remained so much the same. One thing that I noticed was how many young Chinese now speak English. They are walking around discussing strategy, having business or casual discussions \u2013 all in English. These are mostly young people who migrated to the US, the UK, Australia or Canada but just didn\u2019t enjoy living there and have therefore returned home to Hong Kong.

Today I ventured out to start rediscovering old haunts. First stop was my brother\u2019s office \u2013 he is a gadget freak so of course there were several things to look at and try out \u2013 nothing that could match the iPhone of course.\n\nSo off I went on my rounds. Took the MTR (Mass Transit Railway) to Causeway Bay. Had to get some banking done with HSBC. As usual they were quick and efficient so I was soon on my way through a mass of humanity. One thing about Hong Kong \u2013 there are always zillions of people on the streets and in the shops and restaurants, no matter what time it may be.\n\nBy this time I was hungry. It was well past lunch so I went to Perfume River Vietnamese Restaurant on Leighton Road. It is one of the oldest Vietnamese joints in Hong Kong \u2013 and although not very posh \u2013 has some of the greatest tasting food. The old couple that ran the place must have retired or died \u2013 their daughters are now running the place. The older one recognized me and wanted to know where I had been. So I told her that I now lived in Pakistan. Please note that the entire conversation took place in Cantonese because they don\u2019t know how to speak English. Other than the spring in my step, another thing that comes back to me whenever I land in Hong Kong, is the lingo. I find myself remembering how to converse in Cantonese and as each day passes, I become more fluent.\n\nAnyway, back to the food. I ordered two of my favourites from the menu \u2013 Congee (containing scallops, prawns, squid, fish, etc) and shrimps skewered on sugarcane \u2013 yummmm. Not everyone\u2019s cup of tea but things that I miss like crazy in Karachi. The Vietnamese sauce is to die for and the tiny red chillies can kill anyone who is not prepared for them.\n\nOnce I had finished this sumptuous meal I went into Times Square which is a shopping complex that is close by. I had coffee at Starbucks and then checked out some of the shops \u2013 bought some sultana cookies, rich tea biscuits and rasberry cookies from Marks & Spencers as well as honey roasted cashews. No I am not planning to put on weight. These goodies were for my father \u2013 they are some of his favourites.\n\nBy this time I was tired and thought of heading back home \u2013 have had a fever and throat infection so energy level is a bit low. However, on the way back I just had to make one more stop \u2013 at the bean curd shop. I can just hear some of you saying yukk! Well, the cold sweet bean curd is out of this world. I have been addicted to it since I was in school. Sure enough the teeny weeny shop was still there as was the old man who runs it. I ordered the tau fu fa, had it greedily and then went to catch the mini bus home. The mini buses here are much like the yellow devils in karachi \u2013 at least the drivers drive the vehicles exactly like that. The difference is that they are airconditioned and everyone has to be seated.\n\nIt got me home in 25 minutes taking me through some familiar places in Wanchai and Central. Being able to use efficient public transport is so convenient and so much fun. I walked more today than I have walked in Karachi all year. All in all, I had a wonderful day \u2013 it was much needed.

Not that I blame him \u2013 the danger is very real!\n\nWhen he first let me borrow it, I just sat for a few minutes and looked at it and caressed it tenderly absolutely entranced. It is such a beautiful phone \u2013 like anything Apple, the elegance and design far surpasses any phone imaginable. It\u2019s sleek, sexy and absolutely gorgeous!\n\nWhen i finally started checking out the features, it felt like magic. Oh so very responsive to the touch. Safari loads smoothly and quickly \u2013 the landscape option is simply amazing \u2013 it is so seamless you don\u2019t even see it happening.\n\nSliding across the screen to scroll is so easy. Zooming in or out when looking at photographs or Google maps is so totally cool. I sent an SMS and and email message with my new iPhone \u2013 yes MINE! (hey I can dream, can\u2019t i?) and it was just so simple. Movies load and run like magic in YouTube on the iPhone \u2026 and the iPod option works fabulously. I watched Larry King Live and listened to the Beatles. The sound and video quality were superb.\n\nThe calendar, address book and notepad are simplicity personified and a total pleasure to use. Using the camera made me ooh and aah with delight. I am in love with the new iPhone and I haven\u2019t even been able to try out the phone option yet \u2013 the service is not available in Hong Kong and my brother hasn\u2019t been able to hack it although a friend of his told him that it can and has been done locally.\n\nAnd oh oh oh I almost forgot, the trash can is absolutely out of this world \u2013 you delete anything and the cover of the can opens, swallows the doc and closes again. Apple\u2019s attention to detail is what makes all of us totally crazy about the innovative products they come out with.\n\nAnother thing about anything Apple \u2013 there is no learning curve.

Okay so the Judiciary has finally stood up for itself \u2013 bully for them! May I ask when they have ever stood up for the normal citizen of this country? When have they spent as much time and money on highlighting issues that affect the average person in Pakistan?\n\nForget what successive governments have gotten away with. What about looking within their own ranks? Is the judicial system in this country something we can be proud of? Are our courts really the kind of places where justice is dispensed?\n\nIf anyone has had the misfortune of having to go through our legal system \u2013 whether it be to defend oneself or to have property transferred or for any other reason, it becomes quite obvious that justice is bought and sold in the corridors of our exalted courts. From the junior-most employees to the highest persons in the heirarchy, money exchanges hands and deals are made.\n\nI am, under no circumstances, suggesting that all judges and lawyers are corrupt. That would certainly not be the truth. But I have seen for myself that even lawyers with a great deal of personal integrity have to indulge in giving out \u201ctea money\u201d or greasing the hands of corrupt officials and/or their underlings in order to move their cases forward through the system.\n\nOver the past few months the media and the legal community have spent a lot of time on the Chief Justice. The CJ has toured the country, spoken at various events, visited people in hospital, flood-ridden areas, etc \u2013 may I ask if he ever did any of this prior to the Presidential reference? Why did we never hear of any of his kind and good deeds prior to that date?Is he a good human being or were all these actions politically motivated?\n\nNewspapers and television channels tell us that this is only the beginning of the movement. So should we look forward to more strikes, more protest days, more photos of the CJ plastered everywhere? Or can we move on and address some of the moral issues that affect the majority of Pakistanis in this country \u2013 health, illiteracy, poverty, bad infrastructure, unsafe drinking water, unemployment, violence against women and children, lack of security and public transport? Or are these things not as important?\n\nI know I will probably be accused of not understanding the broader vision, the larger impact of the results of this case. Believe me I do understand it. However, I still strongly believe that there will only be a real cause for celebration in this country when the above issues are seriously tackled, when the citizens of this country can expect to be treated fairly in the corridors of justice and when legal cases are moved forward expediciously, judiciously and fairly, so that innocent people are not locked up behind bars waiting for their cases to be heard.

An advance warning though \u2013 I will not risk losing the thrill of listening to Mr. Cowasjee\u2019s stories by concentrating on the blogging too much so, for all you know, I might just stop before I begin.\n\nFive minutes before the arrival of one of Karachi\u2019s oldest citizens, the room is full of anticipation \u2013 the audience is a mixture of young and old \u2013 some here to relive old memories, others to find out what it is that their parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 generation ooohs and aaahs about, and misses with such intensity.\n\nHe arrives and is welcomed with a great deal of affection and warmth. As was to be expected, he starts off with a very typical Adershir remark: Obviously people in Karachi don\u2019t know how to enjoy themselves \u2013 so many here to listen to me. This city needs entertainment. Tell President Musharraf.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, there were 10 of us in each car on the way to school \u2013 not like these days, one person in each car and, that too, an official car. That is why there are traffic jams.\u201d\n\nStory about Pakistan\u2019s first shipping company \u2013 the Muhammadi Shipping Company. Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah started planning to set up this company as early as 1946. He sent Yusuf Haroon from Bombay to Karachi to speak with Rustum Cowasjee about buying his shipping company. Rustum refused to believe that Jinnah had asked to see him, telling Yusuf, \u201cyou never tell the truth\u201d.\n\nWhen Yusuf Haroon (who was Jinnah\u2019s C-in-C and bodyguard) came back and reported this to Jinnah in Bombay, Jinnah supposedly said \u201cHe\u2019s right- you never do tell the truth\u201d \u2013 and he then wrote a letter to Rustum requesting him to come to Bombay. So of course Rustum went.\n\nJinnah offered to buy his company saying that the new country would need a shipping line \u2013 Rustum told the Quaid that there was no point in buying his company, that he only had 6 ships, Pakistan would need at least 200. So Jinnah asked him to set up a new company, and buy the necessary ships. He collected Rs. 2 Crore and Pakistan\u2019s first shipping company was thus registered in Bombay.\n\nAsked for more stories about Jinnah, Mr. Cowasjee said, \u201cWhat is there to say?\u00a0 He was a real gentleman. And it was because of him that we have Pakistan. So many people say that they sacrificed a lot for Pakistan but no \u2026 if he hadn\u2019t been here at that time, there would be no Pakistan. He founded Pakistan.\u201d\n\nWhen asked: Bhutto was your friend but he sent you to jail? Ardeshir said \u201cYes, so?\u201d Three station house officers came to arrest him from his house, telling him that he should feel honoured that so many officers had been sent to arrest him. It was no matter that there was no warrant or show cause notice, no legal reason for his arrest. The person responsible for his release from jail, he said, was mainly Bhutto\u2019s mistress Husna \u2013 he said people in government were more frightened of her than they were of Bhutto. She put a lot of pressure on Bhutto for Cowasjee\u2019s release. He turned to some of the men, smiled and said \u201cYou know that the pressure of a mistress cannot be ignored \u2013 especially not someone like Husna.\u201d\n\nCowasjee says that in the early days of Pakistan, Jinnah\u2019s prediction had been that \u201cEach successive government will be worse than the last.\u201d And apparently, says Ardeshir, he was right.\n\nAbdul Sattar Edhi is known to have recently said: \u201cThere are only two real Muslims in Pakistan \u2013 Roland De Souza of Shehri and Ardeshir Cowasjee.\u201d\n\nAbout Dr. Abdus Salam \u2013 Ardeshir says he asked him once, \u201cSo are you a Pakistani or not? When you get an award, you are accepted as one, otherwise you are labeled a non-Muslim, a non-Pakistani. To which Dr. Abdus Salam who was Ardeshir\u2019s contemporary, said: \u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d\n\nArdeshir Cowasjee has always been an amazing man \u2013 and tonight, as always, even though he rambled on about a lot of things that many of us didn\u2019t understand, he was interesting to listen to. True to himself, he also cursed and was casually dismissive of a number of things.\n\nWhen asked for his advice to the young people of Karachi, he said: if you can get out of Pakistan, get out now! And what if one couldn\u2019t get out, then what? His answer: \u201cthen suffer.\u201d\n\nHe was a riot and most people were in stitches at the stories he had to relate and, more so, in the manner that he related them. He has been, since the twenties, a colourful part of this city and he remains so today.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Ardeshir Cowasjee at\u00a0T2F"},

Yesterday at 1 pm I received a call from Jawwad asking if I would join \u201cthem\u201d for lunch. I thought by \u201cthem\u201d he meant him and his lovely wife and CTO Fawzia (or maybe Mohtashim and Uzma would be with them). Not so. I got to Arizona Grill on Zamzama to find the entire Alchemy Technologies team partying. I was asked to order my \u201cpoison\u201d but after hearing about the number of starters Jawwad had already ordered, I begged shy of placing an order for a Main Course and pigged out on the chicken wings, garlic bread, nachos, etc. None of the others made the same decision though. Boy, can that team eat!!!\n\nBut I stray from the reason for this post. Other than the lunch, I was told that the team was subsequently headed for Area 51 (a bowling alley) \u2013 just for a couple of games, said Jawwad grinning away. Hmmmm. Do they ever work, you might ask?\n\nWell, I think the team of young people that Jawwad has managed to put together are loyal and committed (or at least they should be if they have agreed to work with a madcap like him). And they will probably make up for this midweek jaunt by working on weekends or holidays if it becomes necessary. I remember last month, or was it in May, when there were a number of strikes and protest days, these guys worked on Sundays when there was a need for them to do that.\n\nJawwad is from the school of thought who believes that late hours should not become a standard, that people should have a life outside the office, that work-life balance should be maintained, and that productivity is achieved only if people lead a well-rounded existence and have their share of fun. And if you meet up with the team at Alchemy, you\u2019d see that it works. More power to you Jawwad!

Since this was the first time that P@SHA was holding this event in Pindi, there was a lot of nervousness regarding how the event would be received. The purpose of the P@SHA Career Expo is basically to connect jobs with people, to create an awareness of the kind of companies and careers that exist within the IT sector in Pakistan, to conduct workshops on topics like Communication Skills, Successful Interview Techniques and Professionalism, and to provide Counselling and direction.\n\nThe event was to begin at 10 am on Sunday at the PC in Pindi. The P@SHA team had been working hard to put it all together and we were hoping that the young people for whom this was organized would show up. Well, we weren\u2019t disappointed. There were kids who showed up at 9:15 am from as far afield as Peshawar, Quetta and Jhang.\n\nThe companies had a flow of visitors throughout the day, the workshops were very well attended and the Counsellors from Green&White were kept very busy \u2013 we owe Fahd Khan, Qazi (who was just visiting from Lahore but was roped in) and Osama Hashmi our deepest gratitude for providing direction and advice to all the young people who sought them out.\n\nIn addition, I convinced Osama to present an impromptu workshop \u2013 all i had to do was provide him with some caffeine and within 10 minutes he was on a roll. In addition to his opening talk, he put together a panel (Fahd Khan of Ovex/G&W), Faisal Chohan (Brightspyre), Atif Mumtaz (Cogilent/Brightspyre) and yours truly. We covered loads of topics ranging from job hopping to professionalism to the advantages of working for startups and SMEs as opposed to MNCs. There were also questions from the audience regarding resume writing, fielding difficult questions in interviews, etc. From feedback received, this surprise panel was considered to be a hit. Maybe I should surprise Osama more often.\n\nOnce again the Ambassadors were absolutely brilliant (there were about 24 youngsters from Muhammad Ali Jinnah University). We were working with them for the first time but they proved beyond doubt that they were responsible and professional. They took ownership for the event and were helpful to exhibitors, speakers, organizers and visitors alike. They made us all proud. Thank you Tanveer \u2013 your team and you are going to go far. We wish you well.\n\nOur partners Brightspyre.com were a delight to work with \u2013 Faisal, Jawad, Atif, Usman, Aftab (I am sure I am forgetting someone) were all there actively and professionally participating in the event and helping to make it a very successful Career Expo for exhibitors and visitors as well as for P@SHA. Thanks Brightspyre \u2013 we look forward to working with you again.\n\nMy takeaway from the event was that there are a lot of young people out there \u2013 not only in Pindi/Islamabad but in Peshawar, Quetta, Multan, Jhang, etc who are thirsty for knowledge and direction. We need to extend our contact to areas outside the three main cities \u2013 to provide counselling and opportunities. There were a number of people who came up to me and wanted to know when I could run a Communication Skills workshop for their institute/group. Others wanted to know if we could bring company CTOs/HR Directors to other cities. P@SHA will need to activate itself in other parts of Pakistan \u2013 not necessarily hold large events but start an interaction, hold seminars and workshops, provide on campus counselling etc. Let us start a process.

So when I saw a copy of \u201cThe Leopard & the Fox\u201d at Karachi airport, I bought it and delved right into it. According to the author, the BBC commissioned him to write a three-part TV series on the circumstances leading to the overthrow, trial and execution of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The blurb at the back of the book reads:\n\nAs rehearsals were about to begin, it is said that the BBC hierarchy \u2013 under pressure from the Foreign Office \u2013 decided to cancel the project. Why? General Zia ul Haq was leading the jihad against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He was backed by the USA. According to expert legal opinion, there was a possibility of a whole range of defamation suits from the head of state to judges involved in the case. In consequence, it was decided not to broadcast this hard-hitting and provocative play. The Leopard and the Fox presents both the script and the story of censorship.\n\nI found the book a very easy read despite the theme being such a somber one. Tariq Ali brilliantly brings to life this tragic episode in Pakistan\u2019s history. I just couldn\u2019t put the book down. As I went through it, it was as if I was transported to the seventies. The characters, their personalities, the viciousness, the ambition, the intrigue were all large as life \u2013 it was like watching history being acted out.

This picture shows one of many structures in Karachi that are now bare because the CDGK considered them unsafe with the cyclone expected to hit anytime.\n\nBillboards have been a source of debate for some time not only in this country but in many developed nations as well. How many should be permitted? What kind of regulation should there be? Are they a hazard for drivers? And now with digital billboards going up, will the distraction increase?\n\nThere are loads of other questions:-\n\n1. What kind of income is derived by billboard owners? It is significant from what one hears. Then why do they not maintain the structures to keep them from becoming a hazard? Why do they not follow some set guidelines? Do any such guidelines exist?\n\n2. What does the City Government do with the funds it generates from these billboards? Is it used for beautification of the city of Karachi? Where exactly is the money spent? Is this open for public examination?\n\nLooking at the other side of the coin, have advertisers ever conducted any research on the feasibility of using billboards to advertise their message? Probably only to the extent of what the recall is \u2013 i.e. are colour ads better or B/W for recall? Are billboards on the right side of the road more effective as compared to those on the left?\n\nHas the question ever been asked whether a billboard is better for a product or a service?

Not a lot of information can be placed on billboards due to the number of seconds that a driver sees it. Yes I know there is no mute button, no off switch so the consumer cannot avoid it.

I remember how delighted I was when Air Blue first began operations. Friendly, pleasant, efficient young women attending to passengers during the check-in process and the on board flight service. After years of grumpy, not-very-pleasant-to-look-at national airline crew, we now had this refreshing change. The fact that they used technology (handhelds) for checking in passengers, was a bonus.\n\nThe level of onboard flight service was and is still very good. However, my impression of Air blue changed last week when my team and I had to fly to Lahore. We decided not to fly PIA because it has bec ome standard for PIA flights to be 5 or 6 hours behind schedule \u2013 and we didn\u2019t really have time to waste. Who does? The Air Blue flight was scheduled for 1 pm so we got there at 11:30 a.m., checked in and were told that the flight was going to be 15 \u2013 20 minutes late. Then began the long wait. Passengers constantly asked when boarding would begin but no straight answer was forthcoming. Nor were any announcements made.\n\nIt was only when some passengers became \u201cloud\u201d \u2013 no it wasn\u2019t me I promise you \u2013 that Air Blue finally admitted that they had cancelled the flight and passengers now had two choices \u2013 we could either be transferred onto the 7 pm Air Blue flight or we could have our tickets cancelled, and purchase a PIA ticket. They would not assist with the transfer to PIA \u2013 that was our problem.\n\nAll of us were marched to the Arrivals hall where we first collected our luggage. We then queued up outside at the Air Blue desk where we either booked ourselves on the 7 pm flight or applied for a refund. Some passengers said they didn\u2019t want a refund, that they just wanted a transfer onto the next PIA flight. The response from the Air Blue staff was they they could not assist in transferring passengers to any other flight other than Air Blue. No lunch or refreshment was provided to those who waited (such a contrast from when a friend and I were flying out of Auckland and Qantas couldn\u2019t accommodate us due to a glitch in our visas. They assisted us in getting onto an Air New Zealand flight, took care of us, and were so helpful that despite the long wait, we left feeling well disposed towards all the airlines involved).\n\nMy team and I live in Karachi so we rang for a car, went to have a late lunch nearby and returned to the airport around 5:30 pm to check in all over again. But there were passengers from Hyderabad and some who had come in from international destinations. They just waited at the domestic terminal until it was time to check in. Many were heard to say that they would not fly Air Blue again.\n\nFlight delays can and do happen \u2013 sometimes it is unavoidable but shouldn\u2019t airlines have a strategy for handling these delays? Announcements, refreshments, handling of passengers so that they feel well looked after, etc etc. Or is that not part of our airline service culture?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Concept of service"},

Calling KESC gets you no results \u2013 all they say (if you are persistent enough to get through to them) is that they have no idea when it will be restored \u2013 that they are trying their best.\n\nI have been down with fever and a very nasty cough so I was restless anyway and was sitting in the garden (lovely breeze in Karachi these days \u2013 yes there is a silver lining) wondering if I should give up on power restoration and try and sleep anyway, when I heard some activity outside our gate. Peeping over the gate who do I see pull up but the Nazim himself escorted by two police vans. I don\u2019t know if it was a stunt (who cares!!!) but seconds later the power was back on. Yay! He looked around satisfied, jumped back into the car and went on his merry way \u2013 hopefully to another such district which needed him. I yelled out Thank you \u2013 don\u2019t know if he heard me so I smsed him. My parents always taught me to be polite :-).\n\nMustafa Kamal used to live in this area before he moved up in the world so maybe he has some consideration for his former neighbours \u2013 hey it\u2019s possible. Let us not always look for political motivation. The chap is known to be very hands-on and ever since he has taken over as Nazim, one often spots him checking on roadworks, etc at all odd hours. All I can say is I am glad the power is back and I can finally try and get a few hours\u2019 shut-eye before heading to work tomorrow morning.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Is he a hands-on chap or\u00a0what?"},

With his permission, I am reproducing it below.\n\nThe move by TATA, while one can see its absolute necessity for the corporate org within its own parameters, is close to disastrous for the country. I don\u2019t blame them alone \u2013 they are not the only industrial group to take advantage of very shallow politico-economic planning in \u2019emerging\u2019 nations.\n\nI disagree partly with the thesis that more personal transportation choices will enable the physically challenged to participate in the global economy. That will more likely happen when we modify the current crop of personal computing devices (or better still, redesign them from scratch) to be more accessible (together with making broadband free for all). These should be national priorities, not building cheaper cars.\n\nThis is at the very core of the development debate. The desire for personal \u2018owned\u2019 transportation is a product of two converging forces \u2013\n\n1. the lack of decent reliable public transport in both urban and rural areas, combined with the lack of informational infrastructure to support public transport (just look at how easy it is to get around anywhere, knowledgeably, in cities like London, New York and Amsterdam), and\n\n 2. the hyped up consumerist craze for yet one more gadget, that has led to \u2018aspirations\u2019- driven selling at any cost.\n\nActually vehicles are my pet peeve \u2013 the exceedingly poor engineering design concept of wheeled/tyred vehicles that depend on \u2018superb\u2019 roads \u2013 which are, as it happens, natural land destroyers, are a feature of the last 125 years of \u2018development\u2019 that have seen an explosion of foolish urban and national planning (such that it is).\n\nHow is it that the craze for personal transport is controlled in cities like Singapore? Quite easy \u2013 just charge an arm and a leg for the privilege, and make sure that the alternatives actually work, and the city functions quite well without massive traffic jams and ridiculously crowded roads. It doesn\u2019t need ministerial visits* to find out how that happens \u2013 just search on wikipedia, google, or answers. But there are other alternatives \u2013 did anyone notice how, in the film I, Robot, everyone used identical electric vehicles that were clearly not \u2018owned\u2019 by their users?\n\n*Visit season is just ending, and a parade of ministers returns to devil all our states from their factfinding tours abroad. This city, Mumbai, is set to be the new Shanghai, once every minister has paid his/her obeisance to Punta Arenas and Labrador on their way to finding out how Shanghai works (with a bullet and a noose, btw, in case you are also wondering).", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Cars or computers?"},

Little did I know what awaited me. At exactly 4 pm, KESC decided to shut off the power and at around 4:30 a windstorm the likes of which I haven\u2019t ever seen in Karachi, lashed the city. This was followed by rain. One of the tallest trees in our garden (planted by my nephew 12 years ago) broke in half and fell on the gate. Fortunately no-one was hurt. This is just one of many stories from across the city \u2013 hoardings falling, trees being uprooted and of course drains being blocked and power being put off. Over 44 people killed, hundreds injured.\n\n In one statement, KESC said that the grids were turned off as a precautionary measure. In another, they claimed that one of the major feeders caught fire. Whatever the story, no-one at KESC was answering the complaints number.\n\nOur UPS survived 7 hours after which it gave up so I turned on the generator which only lasted two hours because the chowkidaar had forgotten to refill it with fuel. Somehow from 1 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. we survived on rechargeable lights and fans after which I had to venture out to get more fuel. My father was upset that I was going out at that hour but I didn\u2019t have an option since there was no-one else who could do it.\n\nWe are now into our 23rd hour without electricity with no inkling as to when the power will be back. The refrigerators are off as are the Air conditioners because our generator can only support lights and fans and my Mac (thank God). There is no cold water to quench my thirst.\n\nBut as I sit here whining, I wonder how the majority of people in the city who have no UPS and no generator are managing to cope. Much as we may complain about the power riots and people setting tyres on fire or pelting cars, can we really understand how it feels to be without power and water for hours and days? Two people in my neighbourhood have died today. An announcement was being made earlier. I wonder if it was because of the heat or perhaps an accident caused by electrical cables lying around on the streets or collapsing walls or a falling tree or hoarding?\n\nWho do we take to task? Can we sue KESC? If we do, will it be any use except to make some lawyers richer and to cause ourselves further aggravation? The government tells us that the problems of this city are severe and cannot be dealt with in the short term. This particular government has been in power for almost 8 years. Granted the City Government has done some work on the infrastructure and the flyovers and underpasses have eased the traffic situation a bit (when the underpasses are not underwater that is). Previous governments have made promises but never kept them. Where do the citizens go for answers to their grievances?

These aren\u2019t questions that will keep me awake at night but I do wonder if women in this country will ever be recognized for what they achieve because they have beaten all odds, because they are good at what they do and because they deserve to be recognized.

Of course this did not happen. It actually started at 11:40 a.m. because, as is usual in this country, only a few of us got there on time. Strangely it was the speakers who were there on time \u2013 perhaps that is why they are successful. When will we as a nation learn to value time I wonder? The number of events that start late because the Chief Guest, the delegates or the organizers are not on time, amazes and depresses me.\n\nThe success of the Asian Tigers is to a large extent due to hard work and punctuality. Valuing other people\u2019s time is an indication of respect. I lose it whenever someone says \u201cbut this is Pakistan\u201d as if that makes it alright.\n\nAnyway, once the conference began, I was totally engaged. Most of the speakers were absolutely brilliant and the Q&A sessions brought the event to life. It is difficult to put down what everyone said but some of the key issues that were discussed were:\n\nThe interest charged is 18 \u2013 22%. Is this supposed to assist women with small businesses or penalize them? This came through in the Q&A. I also brought up the fact that for some reason financial institutions and government were of the opinion that women only needed micro-finance (i.e. between 30K \u2013 100K) to start businesses. What about those of us who wanted to start an SME operation and not a cottage industry? This amount was nowhere near enough. Shehla Akram Javed, Chairperson of the FPCCI Committee on Women Entrepreneurship, brought up the question of collateral-free loans for women. She said the Bank of Punjab was offering them so why couldn\u2019t banks in Sindh be persuaded to do so well \u2013 especially the Women\u2019s Bank and NBP. She said this was especially necessary unless the government was going to do something about addressing the women\u2019s right to inherit property.\n\nSeema Tahir of TVOne, Mehreen Meher, City Editor of Daily Times and a lady who used to work for BBC for many years were amongst the panelists. Some of the barriers and challenges were discussed as were the opportunities. However, through Q&A it was highlighted that women needed to play a more pro-active role in ensuring that advertisements and programming did not present stereotypes and further propagate cultural norms that hurt the integration of women into society.\n\nJustice Majida Rizvi in her talk pointed out articles in the constitution that ensure equal rights for the women of Pakistan. She also quoted from the Quran and said that c ertain politicians were interpreting the Quran and Hadith incorrectly to refrain from giving women their just rights. Her co-panelists were Kashmala Tariq and Farooq Sattar who emphasized the contributions of this government in terms of amendments to the Hudood Ordinance and the Women\u2019s Protection Bill as well as the 33% reprsentation in Parliament for women.\n\nKashmala is a very good speaker and did bring out some of the problems with existing laws. I don\u2019t know her personally but I would like to believe that she is sincere in her efforts to help change the status quo for women in this country and get for them the rights they deserve.\n\nHowever, I think I did not make myself very popular with at least two people on the panel when I asked if they didn\u2019t think that further work needed to be done by government to ensure that a large number of the women in parliament were not merely puppets of political parties and politicians.\n\nI spoke about Careers for Women in IT \u2013 mentioned some of the success stories, the barriers and challenges that existed and what could be done to overcome them.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the conference and thought that it brought out a lot of important issues. My only regret was that there weren\u2019t enough younger women in the audience. Registration charges were Rs. 2,500 but when I asked the organizers why there weren\u2019t more young girls from the colleges and universities taking part, they said they had asked the universities to send their students and that the registration fee would be waived. I hope that is true. If it is, then I am surprised that there weren\u2019t more of them.\n\nOf course the turnout increased in the pre-lunch and pre-dinner segments <sigh> \u2026 will we never get our priorities right?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Women\u2019s Leadership Conference\u00a02007"},

Hence t2f is not on Zamzama and looks nothing like the spate of coffee shops that have spurted all over Karachi. It is on Khayaban-e-Ittehad on the second floor of the Prime Point Building. A location map is available on their website. The coffee is delicious and affordable, so are the chillers and sandwiches, quiches, etc.\n\nI have held many of my meetings there (especially when KESC has played havoc with the electricity on Zamzama where my office is situated). The ambience, the fast wifi connection and the delicious drinks have made me go back again and again. I must admit however that I end up buying books and t-shirts that I had not budgeted for \u2013 but they are worth it.\n\nYesterday I went there at 4 to have meetings with my lawyer and a lady from CSF/USAID. Hadn\u2019t had time for lunch so I snacked on the new finger foods that have been introduced at t2f \u2013 crackers with fetta cheese (and spicy chips and dip that i have yet to sample). I also had the delicious , an , another Chiller \u2013 they are addictive! I highly recommend the crackers and fetta to anyone who doesn\u2019t want to partake of a heavy sandwich.\n\nI got another perspective on t2f yesterday from my lawyer who says that he only goes back to food outlets that pass the one sure test he has \u2013 apart from having tasty snacks and a nice environment of course \u2013 and that is the state of the washrooms.

Very invigorating conversation!\n\nAnyway, as soon as I got into the car, I turned on FM107 for traffic updates. Have got used to doing that because it is so helpful to know which areas to avoid during the rush hour. This evening there was a report that due to power protests, tyre burning, car-pelting, etc. the route leading from Hasan Square to Gharibabad was jammed. That is my normal route home. So I changed strategy and did as the RJ suggested \u2013 took the Rashid Minhas Road. All through my drive, thousands of drivers and i were kept updated by Aquib Tauqeer regarding the different trouble spots and possible alternative routes.\n\nListeners phoned in (I did too) to advise other listeners which routes to take and which to avoid. The power of radio was never so pronounced in my mind as it was this evening (although of course it couldn\u2019t compare with the ham radios used during the Tsunami and earthquakes).\n\nAquib also tried to appeal to the protestors (although i don\u2019t think they had their radios or ipods with FM transmitters with them) by telling them that although they were justified in their frustrations, they should not take it out on fellow citizens who not only had to put up with the same power breakdowns but now also had to sit in traffic jams for 3 \u2013 5 hours because of the riots. Not to mention the ambulances that were stuck and patients who could die if they didn\u2019t get medical care quickly.\n\nI continue to live in the hope that one day my fellow citizens will realize that burning public transport, hurting others by pelting their cars with stones and burning tyres and shops is not the way to be heard. One should protest \u2013 but do it without causing harm to people and property, do it without resorting to violence.\n\nAnyway, the purpose of this post was to thank FM107. The young RJs on this station are to be commended for what they do. I am not too keen on their taste in music (but then that is a question of personal taste). However, some of the discussions that are held in the morning show Tazadum give one hope that young people are becoming more aware and more involved in their surroundings and are searching for ways to improve things in this country.

Since then this entrepreneural spirit seems to have spread to other countries and one often gets emails from South Africa, the UK, Saudi Arabia and a host of other countries offering to share millions of dollars if bank details are provided. Sometimes it is a lottery that you have supposedly won. Of course most of us delete these immediately but some have been known to have fallen victims to these scams.\n\nI received a message a few weeks ago advising me that I had won the Virgin Atlantic Airways lottery worth GBP 500,000. Since all it asked for was my office address and phone number so that the money could be sent to me, I was tempted into sending a response (hey who doesn\u2019t need GBP 500,000). I thought I would receive another mail asking me for my account number and a blank signed invoice. That never happened so I promptly forgot about the whole thing \u2013 until last week.\n\nWhen I returned from Delhi I received a message that someone by the name of Jackson had called me. It was a Mobilink number that he had left for me to return his call. I didn\u2019t get round to calling him because of all the other matters that required my attention that day. So in the evening I got another call from Jackson. He sounded like a foreigner (had a strange accent that I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on). Anyway, he asked how my trip had been, then told me that my consignment had arrived. I asked \u201cWhat consignment?\u201d He jogged my memory by mentioning the lottery and said that he had flown into Islamabad to deliver the consignment to me. He then asked when I could fly to Islamabad. I told him I lived in Karachi and why couldn\u2019t the consignment be sent to me here. He said it could but I would have to pay clearing charges. I asked what the clearing charges were for \u2013 it isn\u2019t as if the money would have been shipped in a crate! It must have come through a bank or exchange company. He said these were bank clearing charges. I asked him how much and he said $2,000. Now I knew that he was taking me for a ride so I told him \u201cThat\u2019s fine \u2013 you clear it and send me the money and an invoice and I will pay you \u2013 or better still just deduct it from the GBP 500,000\u201d. He responded that this was not the correct procedure and that I would have to send the US$2,000 first before the winnings could be sent to me. I told him where to go and hung up.

The speakers were mainly researchers, civil society representatives and a sprinkling of business people. In addition, there were government speakers mainly from the host country and some observers \u2013 the Minister of Trade from the Pakistan High Commission and his counterparts from Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.\n\nThe conference started off with some very eloquent speeches on the history of ICWA and SAARC and very encouraging quotations were cited from speeches made by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and others. Then there were a number of detailed presentations on the Physical Connectivity between the 8 SAARC nations. A study had been commissioned and this chap took us painfully through every existing and missing rail track. From what he said it would take years and cost billions of dollars to get the infrastructure in place to connect the SAARC countries sufficiently to deal with the flow of people and goods. This included rail, road, water and air links.\n\nThe next session was on Economic Connectivity \u2013 the session that I was a part of. I don\u2019t think I started my speech very diplomatically when I said \u201cPardon my cynicism but SAARC is now 21 years old and many of us are weary of the fact that beyond summits and declarations and conferences, no progress has actually been made in bringing the 8 countries together in any kind of meaningful initiative.\u201d I went on to say that whereas it was lovely to be in Delhi again, most of us wondered if this would be just another series of talks and presentations leading to no firm implementation or recommendations.\n\nWhat was strange about the morning session was that when all sorts of infrastructure was being discussed, no-one mentioned the infrastructure that already exists \u2013 the Internet and the telecom infrastructure! There was talk about setting up a South Asian University where kids would study and work together thus developing a better understanding. Okay not a bad idea at all, but what about doing simpler things like connecting the education institutions in the region so that they could share knowledge, research and curriculum and work on collaborative projects, share lectures being delivered by brilliant professors, etc etc.\n\nWhy not connect the hospitals so that research and medical practices can be shared and better ways found to address the many health issues of those living in our part of the world? And why stop there? What about working together in the area of Disaster Managemen, Open Source, Wireless Rural Connectivity, Technology for the Disabled, and a host of other things that can be started NOW.\n\nAs for the IT sector, there are businesses that want to work together in the area of developing and training human resource, as well as on joint projects. India is facing an HR problem because of rising costs of trained people. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka need assistance to build up their software and services sector. At the moment companies in Pakistan and India are working below the government radar, sometimes via a third country like the UAE. This just adds to costs and makes it a lot more difficult to collaborate.\n\nTo create more economic wealth and job opportunities for the young people in our region, especially in the area of IT, two things need to be addressed \u2013 the visa regime and the ability to easily transfer funds and invest in each others countries. Can the governments of our region handle these two issues while they are working on the physical infrastructure issues and the political issues?\n\nI brought out all these points in my address and a number of people came up to me later to say that they agreed there were areas that SAARC could move on with speed if they really wanted to.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Is SAARC headed\u00a0anywhere?"},

There was to be collaboration in other areas but Culture and Art were totally missing. When she saw this, she said she started a one person movement (referring to the saying that one lonely Sikh is equivalent to a \u2018sawa lakh\u2019 army). She made the lives of the Ministry of External Affairs in India a living hell. Others from India and Pakistan joined in the struggle and they managed to convince the governments of the SAARC countries that culture was a shortcut to better understanding and integration (one doesn\u2019t know whether they actually understood this or whether she just wore them out with her persistence). SAARC has now added a paragraph in the Charter that refers to Cultural cooperation.\n\nIt is amazing that writers, poets, artists and performers were considered so dangerous that visas for them were extremely hard to process in those days. Madeeha Gauhar said that she could only visit India at that time because her grandfather was still alive. It was only years later that it became easier for her and others like her to get visas more easily. Of course NOCs are still required if they are to perform.\n\nAjeet Cour said that the soul of people living in the SAARC region lies in folklore. She suggested that we should carry out serious translations of all our folklore and literature and thus explore the souls of the peoples of this region. Dance and song will follow. There was a suggestion that there should be a SAARC Cultural Festival, a Theatre Festival, a Film Festival, a Music Festival, \u2026 anything and everything that would help remove layers of doubt and mistrust and slowly heal the wounds of history. Only then could we move beyond the borders and view each other as human beings with similar feelings and desires and an appreciation for the beauty that exists in our part of the world.", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Culture excluded \u2026"},

Have I gone insane you might ask? My oldest friends will probably tell you that there has always been a screw or two loose in my head.\n\nBut I have a reason for saying that I felt lucky \u2013 I had a UPS, and when that died the small generator I possess gave me some respite. What about all those people who don\u2019t have either of these alternatives available? How do they cope? What keeps them from going out of their minds? How do they survive? I have no answers. Maybe KESC does.\n\nAll I know is that such things can turn the coolest and most docile of people to violence. The other day we didn\u2019t have power in the office for 7 hours. Prior to that the night before one of our graphic designers had no electricity at home most of the night. I can\u2019t tell you how shocked I was when she turned around and said with a calm viciousness that she felt like bombing KESC. This came from a young woman who keeps a cool head when the rest of us are at each other\u2019s throats near to the close of a project. I have never heard her speak in such a tone.\n\nWhen I expressed my surprise at her outburst, she said \u201cWhen you can\u2019t sleep at night and you can\u2019t work during the day, something inside you snaps \u2026 how long do they expect a person to be patient and accepting?\u201d How long indeed?!", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Driven to violence?"},

He said that contracts of players would now be performance-based and would not be based on seniority. Fair enough. How would performance be judged and what were the incentives that the Board would use to motivate the players?\n\nHe proudly announced that any player making a century would get Rs. 300,000 instead of the Rs. 100,000 that had been the norm so far\u2026 and if a player was instrumental in running out someone from an opposing team (as opposed to running out his own teammates) he would be given Rs. 100,000. Money \u2013 the prime motivator. Granted money is necessary but is it what we should be using as a motivation tool? Is it what creates passion for the game? Is it what really drives a player to put in his best? Whatever happened to playing for the love of the game, enjoying it, playing for your country and your fans, giving a 100% because you take pride in what you do? What about emphasizing on ethics and the rules of the game and teaching the youngsters that overall fitness, teamwork and consistency are essential ingredients for an athlete? Or am I being naive? Is that all old hat Dr. Ashraf?", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "Passion and pride \u2013 old\u00a0hat?"},

Most people they hire are products of an education system that has failed to produce thinking, passionate and ethical individuals.\n\nP@SHA has for the past 3 years been holding Job Fairs where apart from matchmaking companies with individuals, we have tried to run workshops on subjects we feel are not being covered by the education system \u2013 for whatever reason.\n\nThis year P@SHA is holding a Career Expo where career tracks in different streams will be highlighted and young people will be able to question CEOs and HR Directors regarding growth prospects and exciting opportunities in different streams of the Information & Communication Technology sector. There are cutting edge areas that need people with different skillsets and very often youngsters are not aware of this.\n\nIn addition, there will be Panel Discussions on subjects like why there is such a disconnect between what universities are turning out and what is needed to build a stronger industry.\n\nIt promises to be an interesting and lively event where ideas will be shared and a lot of interaction will take place. There is something for company professionals as well \u2013 Paul Keijzer will be conducting a workshop on Building High Performance Companies.\n\nCounsellors will of course be available all day to offer advice and answer questions.\n\nThe Career Expo will be held in Karachi on June 16, in Islamabad on June 23 and in Lahore on June 30.

I have been ill for several weeks and, like most people, I have avoided a visit to the doctor\u2019s office. Yesterday after being nagged by friends and family, I finally succumbed and went to see a physician. He had been referred to me (strange that in this city finding a good GP is a really tough job). I went fearing the worst. But the chap \u2013 a parsi by the name of Cyasp Nowsherwani \u2013 turned out to be very different from what I had expected.\n\nHe had a laptop on his desk (which for me was an instant winner \u2013 although if it had been a Mac I would have been more impressed). He asked how I was, to which I replied that unfortunately his profession was such that no-one dropped in unless they were unwell. He laughed \u2013 a doctor with a sense of humour? I was already beginning to shed my reservations about this visit. And when he said that cutting down my intake of coffee was unnecessary for my increased BP (taking a sip of his own coffee as he said this), he totally won me over.\n\nAs a subsequence of this visit, I have to undergo some tests, and some medicine was naturally prescribed but the pain of a doctor\u2019s visit was significantly reduced \u2026 thank you Dr. Cyasp Nowsherwani. We could do with more doctors like you.\n\nNote: And yes he is a good doctor too \u2013 he is treating me and not just a couple of symptoms", "author": "Jehan Ara", "title": "If you have to see a doctor\u00a0\u2026"},

That fathers borrow money to send their sons for higher education and to get their daughters wedded off? After all, why waste money on a girl\u2019s education right? Annoying as hell and certainly not the kind of values we should be instilling in the new generation.

Just when we were beginning to feel that our city was beginning to find its place, infrastructure was becoming better, people were more confident about moving around the city at all hours, we saw the kind of violence that this city hasn\u2019t seen in a long while. It left most of us traumatised and shaken. However, after the first couple of days, when we were \u201callowed out\u201d on the streets again, I looked around and marvelled at how resilient Karachi and its people are. People going about their business, kids back in school, everything on track as if nothing untoward had happened \u2013 apart from politicians trying to score points off each other on television channels and in newspapers. Have you noticed how none of them has a solution to offer? They are all the same.\n\nBut the point of this post was to share something that I saw last night as I drove home from a seminar i was attending at the Marriott. I was driving along, music on in the car \u2013 traffic was not so bad so I was quite relaxed. A few minutes from home I suddenly heard a loud crash and huge pieces of metal seemed to fall out of the sky and drop a few feet ahead of me. I looked to my right and found that a suzuki pickup from the other side of the road had skidded and wrapped itself around a tree \u2013 the pickup breaking into several pieces, with one person trapped in the car and another thrown out a few feet away. Several people stopped their cars, jumped out and went to help the injured. I guess it was nothing unusual but looking at this scene i thought \u2013 these are the kind of people that live in this city \u2013 instinctively helpful and caring.
