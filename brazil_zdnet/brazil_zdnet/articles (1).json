The average price of the tablets sold was R$500 ($128).\n\nThere are macroeconomic factors linked to the market collapse, according to the analyst: several companies with no local manufacturing facilities that were importing tablets, could not cope with the fluctuation of the dollar against the local currency, the real.\n\nAs well as the dollar hike, the Brazilian consumer is losing interest in tablets as phablets (smartphones with larger screens) became more popular.\n\nAfter a \"tablet fever\" that dominated most of 2013, the decline in tablet sales started in 2014 and numbers have also gone down consistently this year. For consumers, disappointment with low-quality options was a main factor behind the lack of interest back then, before the phablet cannibalization began.\n\nFrom the corporate standpoint, tablet demand started to dry up as the government also stopped buying the devices last year.\n\nIDC expects that 6.5 million tablets will be sold in Brazil in 2015.

My husband is attending the match with friends and his plan was to travel to Rio on Sunday in the morning (we are based in S\u00e3o Paulo) and then collect the tickets ahead of the match in the afternoon.\n\nThis week, he received a notice from the official ticketing website, saying that tickets could only be collected until the day before the match - and only at a handful of sites in Rio de Janeiro, despite it being a website that sells sporting tickets nationwide.Several calls and emails later, he received an email saying that non-Rio residents could collect their tickets at a certain location on Sunday. That information was never mentioned in that initial notice, though. Hmmm.\n\nSo what is supposed to be a straighforward ticket purchase suddenly turns into an ordeal where you are supposed to rearrange your life around some dinosauric arrangement.\n\nYesterday, when announcing the details around the ticket sales for the World Cup, Fifa's Weil \"strongly recommended\" that appointments are made online to collect the tickets at authorized locations at a certain time. That is to supposedly avoid lines and crowding at the sites.\n\nI accept the point that those watching the games may want to keep the paper ticket as a souvenir, but the enforcement of old school tickets and the lack of an alternative seems like a big hassle to me - and my recent experience reinforces that - let alone overseas visitors who value their holiday time. And because people can't have a choice, it is quite likely that they will have to spend a lot of that time trying to sort out something that could have easily been done at home."},

That is true, but the country has also been suffering with frequent catastrophes such as the recent floods in the Amazon region and the brutal drought in the Northeast - so the government is turning to advanced technology to improve the prediction of such disasters.\n\nAn agreement was signed at the end of last week between the Science, Technology and Innovation ministry, the National Center for Alerting and Monitoring of Natural Disaters (Cemaden) and Brazil's largest telco Vivo, where information on incidents collected by rain gauges will be sent through 3G/GPRS networks to a machine-to-machine (M2M) platform which will monitor and analyze data on rain precipitation.\n\nSome 1,500 rain gauges will be installed in federal government sites and mobile phone towers in risk areas determined by Cemaden in 19 out of 27 Brazilian states. With the new system, which will be focused on detection of potential floods, inundations, mudslides and droughts, information on potential hazards will get to the monitoring facility faster - and response times in the event of an emergency should be reduced.\n\nCemaden was set up by the Science, Technology and Innovation ministry in 2011, in response to the frequent natural disasters that have occurred in Brazil over the last few years. Its key area of focus is to strike as many partnerships as possible with the private sector, so that the capacity of disaster monitoring can be improved and cities can be better prepared to deal with these events.\n\nThe deadly floods seen in large urban centers and extreme droughts of late are just some examples of an obvious shift in climatic patterns in Brazil. It also means that the lack of effective alert and prevention mechanisms is something that cannot be taken lightly.\n\nSure, solving the problem would require longer-term actions such as better urban planning, as well as the creation of a culture of readiness and fast response both within the government and society, as seen in countries such as the US and Australia. But as news of thousands of lives lost in natural disasters continue to hit the headlines in Brazil, additional investment and resources are needed right now - and technology has a crucial role to play in facing these difficulties.\n\nBecause if things continue as they are at present, we might as well get Phil to help us predict the weather."},

From my personal experience and observations, Brazilians are a lot more relaxed about how their data is collected and used than their European or American counterparts \u2013 but this might well change as people start to get a better understanding of these practices.\n\nRegardless of how it is approached, it is interesting to see that a generic publication would print a story entirely focused on big data, because it highlights that the priorities of technology decision-makers and what Jo\u00e3o and Maria do in their digital lives are totally intertwined. And that IT is definitely no longer for geeks only."},

One of the companies heard is also considering legal action against the Facebook-owned app.\n\nThe report, which questions the validity of WhatsApp's voice service (rather than the messaging feature) for operating based on mobile phone numbers, will be presented to Brazil's telecommunications regulator Anatel within two months.\n\nThe telcos argue that they pay activation and ongoing fees for each mobile phone number issued to customers, something that WhatsApp doesn't do.\n\n\"We are questioning specifically the voice service, which basically makes calls using a mobile phone number. Services like Skype have their own login and password and this is not irregular,\" one of the sources said.\n\nSeveral senior telecom executives in Brazil have voiced their concerns and opinion about WhatsApp's service and how it affects them. For example, Telefonica Brazil's president Amos Genish has been quoted as saying that WhatsApp is a \"pirate operator\" and that the company also intended to question the app's operating model.\n\nHowever, services like Skype - which is deemed \"legal\" by the operators - and WhatsApp all deliver voice and data via the data package and by law, companies should not interfere in how customers utilize their data allowances.\n\nWhat Brazilian companies and government seem to be trying to do is introduce regulations - and therefore a taxation regime - to over-the-top services which include WhatsApp as well as Netflix.\n\nBrazil's Communications minister Ricardo Berzoini has recently said that services like WhatsApp \"subtract jobs from the Brazilian market\", while failing to recognize that the laws that govern the provision of telecom services in Brazil are outdated and focus only on fixed line services - a model that has been surpassed by mobile services long ago.\n\nSimilarly to other situations where disruptors such as Uber for taxis and Airbnb for hotels also got into trouble, the telecom industry in Brazil is doing what is expected: defending its existing business model and discrediting the newcomer for doing precisely what appeals to the customer base. But these arguments never really protect customers and are only ever good for one thing: boosting public and private sector revenue.\n\nA comment on the subject made recently by Google Brazil's head, Fabio Coelho, was interesting: he defends the view that while telcos complain about the use of WhatsApp for voice, they also generate profits from the tool's popularity. In addition, the executive pointed out that telcos should actually learn to live with a reality where their market is shared with mobile phone apps. But Coelho's main point was that choices should be offered to customers. That makes perfect sense."},

It said that the decision boiled down to two factors: Allegedly, filters applied by Facebook meant that only 1 to 2 percent of the users who \"Liked\" the Globo pages received the content in their news feed and therefore generated traffic for its websites. Also, Globo doesn't like the possibility of Mark Zuckerberg's firm being able to display competitor ads to the fans of Globo-maintained pages.\n\n\"People don't go to the fan pages, they consume what has been published there on them as it is published in their news feed. And not necessarily everything that was published on the fan page is out there [in a user's news feed],\" chief executive at Globo.com, Juarez Queiroz, said to marketing publication Meio & Mensagem.\n\n\"Also, when you want to advertise on Facebook, there is a page that is specifically designed for that. There, advertisers can say, for example, that they want to send ads to young males, and can choose choose to target them by their interests, which are filters segmented by the fan pages.

But someone might want to tell Mr Queiroz that a quick analysis of how the web has progressed over the years \u2014 from static pages to web 2.0 to social networking \u2014 will show that, nowadays, people spend a lot of their time online on social networks. And the way people want to consume information is by dynamically filtering, aggregating, and selecting it \u2014 and tools like Facebook represent the very core of people's social media experience. If every other major media company, such as CBS, the BBC, and Deutsche Welle, is actively using Facebook to create such engagement with their audience, why would Globo want to cut that communication channel?\n\nMr Queiroz might also like to know that Facebook doesn't \"edit\" anything. Similarly, to Google's algorithm, it uses a long list of factors \u2014 aka Edgerank \u2014 to decide what fans will (and won't) see in their news feed. And if Globo wanted to heavily promote something related to a certain TV show or publication, certainly they could shell out a few thousand dollars in Facebook adverts to get those extra eyeballs \u2014 its competitors have probably figured that one out.\n\nAs the pre-eminent media group in Brazil, Globo should be exploring the future \u2014 but clearly, the company is not embracing online content distribution and how it can enhance their content.

People use Twitter to share their opinion and get feedback, so there is an opportunity for advertisers to take part in meaningful conversations with their audience \u2014 and that's our main focus,\" the Twitter exec pointed out.\n\nAs far as big contracts are concerned, Twitter is not doing badly at all in Brazil: Its client portfolio include B2B players such as Qualcomm, telecoms giant Vivo, Brazilian airline TAM, banking group Ita\u00fa, and Skol, the beer brand.

Ribenboim said that Twitter will also be heavily targeting the middle market: \"Brazil has a lot of [online advertising] demand within the medium-sized bracket, which is something we didn't see a lot of until recently.\"\n\nAnother critical area of focus for Twitter in Brazil is around partnerships with companies that can use its application programming interface (API) to create value for third-parties, as well as developers.\n\n\"It is absolutely strategic to create and nurture relationships with developers, as allowing people to use our API and give it a service layer is a perfect way to multiply and scale up the possibilities of our platform,\" Ribenboim said.\n\nIn terms of growth through acquisitions, the Twitter executive did not discard the possibility of, in the future, buying Brazilian companies that could bolster its technology capabilities.\n\n\"As a tech company, we would normally look for companies that can add value in a technology sense, and we will have the opportunity to look at the Brazilian market [for possible acquisitions],\" Ribenboim said.\n\nAs every key business leader, Ribenboim is talking to government leaders and other big corporates about how it can contribute to Brazil's overall success over the coming years with the World Cup and Olympic Games being staged in the country.\n\n\"The World Cup will be an exceptional opportunity to showcase Brazil and show all the great things we have, and Twitter will be an ideal platform to do that, as people will be talking about Brazil all over the world. We are talking to the government about these things,\" he said.\n\nUsing Twitter as a public service \u2014 very much along along the lines of what the company already did in Japan in case of earthquakes, and the US with hurricane Sandy \u2014 is also in the cards as the firm matures in Brazil.\n\nDuring the session with entrepreneurs last night, Ribenboim cited the second-screen trend as becoming standard in Brazil, and another massive opportunity for his company.\n\n\"Similar to the time when cinema moved on to having sound, we are living in a time when doing things like watching TV and tweeting will just become normal. It is certainly becoming the case here in Brazil,\" he said.\n\n\"And if I meet someone here who hasn't done that yet [watching TV and tweeting simultaneously], I absolutely recommend it, as the dynamic of the program totally changes: You find irony, humor, and a perspective that is entirely diverse to your own,\" he said.\n\nRibenboim also talked about the huge uptake of Twitter by Brazilian celebrities \u2014 footballer Kak\u00e1, for example, has 12 million followers, comedy TV program P\u00e2nico has a follower count of over 7 million, and recent Grammy Award winner Michel Tel\u00f3 is followed by 3 million users \u2014\u00a0and how that also helps the company in its advertising-related objectives.\n\n\"Brazilian celebrities have found Twitter to be an ideal tool to talk to their fans and become a media outlet themselves \u2014 which in turn increases the financial return they can get,\" Ribenboim said.\n\n\"It has to be done in a fun and genuine way though \u2014 if a celebrity tweets he or she are using toothpaste X in the morning, it doesn't work as well as when they show something from their lives that is integrated with the advertiser's strategy. Then it becomes something really cool \u2014 and valuable, too.\"\n\nWhile Twitter experiences an upward climb in Brazil, other social tools, such as Google+, continue to evolve \u2014\u00a0possibly treading on Twitter's toes. But Ribenboim, in true Brazilian fashion, pointed out that there is room for everyone to play.\n\n\"I believe we are fortunate in the fact we are a different platform, and people use it in a unique way. And as long as we remain unique, we will remain successful.\""},

Oh, wait...", "sentiment": 0.08553719008264463, "text": "Last week, the four largest mobile operators in Brazil launched their 4G commercial offerings across the cities where the Confederations Cup will take place this year \u2014 but not without concerns over whether it will be a reality.\n\nThe local firms that have auctioned for 4G spectrum (Vivo, Claro, Oi, and TIM) had committed to provide at least 50 percent of urban area coverage in the Confederations Cup host cities. But some operators seem to be ahead of schedule, and customers in other locations \u2014 such as the most densely populated city in the country and World Cup host, S\u00e3o Paulo \u2014 can already buy 4G services.\n\nOne of the operators, Claro, said that by May 1, its 4G product had already attracted 20,000 new users. The telecoms regulator, Anatel, predicts that by December, 4 million people will be using the technology.\n\nIt all sounds good in theory. But is the Brazilian offering of 4G what it really says on the tin?\n\nAvailability is the key area of concern. Consumer rights association Reclame has already released a statement that advises consumers against buying 4G services at this stage. According to Reclame, the 4G network is hardly worth the cost, since it will initially operate at a frequency of 2.5GHz, when in reality, the ideal rate is 700MHz \u2014 which means consumers buying 4G coverage may get a 3G signal until fourth-generation coverage is available.\n\nBrazilian Communications Minister Paulo Bernardo dismissed the claims, saying that consumers are \"intelligent\", and that the warnings will not stop them from buying the services. \"Brazil will stage the first large-scale 4G test in the world,\" the minister added.\n\nIt is certainly not a cheap test. The monthly cost of 4G services to end consumers varies from R$34.90 ($17.35) for a 600MB data plan to R$98 ($48.76) for a 5GB option. The amounts are exclusive of the voice plan, which is charged separately. Handsets compatible with the 4G technology include the Motorola RAZR HD, Samsung Galaxy S III LTE, which can cost as much as R$1,900 ($945.39) and R$1,400 ($696.65), respectively. Average individual monthly income within the so-called \"emerging middle class\" in Brazil is R$1,019 ($507.12).\n\nFinally, the promise of a tenfold speed increase in mobile connections offered by the 4G novelty should not distract customers from the fact that operators have barely managed to cater for 3G voice and data. According to the telecoms regulator, 40 percent of Brazilian mobile phone users are unhappy with the 3G services they currently get.\n\nIn July 2012, an 11-day ban was imposed by the government on signing up new clients on three of the four operators due to poor provision of services. And last month, the telecoms body fined TIM in R$9.6m ($4.7m) for supposedly dropping calls on purpose, to force customers to redial and therefore increase its takings.\n\nSo, contrary to what the Brazilian politicians are saying, \"intelligent\" consumers should remain very wary of 4G for some time to come."},

The Council has 10 days to forward the proposals to the Mayor, who then has two weeks to make a final decision. Haddad has already indicated that he is likely to approve the ban.\n\nAt the same time, a related proposal has been presented to the City Council to allow studies to be carried out by the Mayor's office to legalize new technologies that focus on public transport. The project also requires the creation of mechanisms to better evaluate the service provided by traditional taxis.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, where Uber also faces issues - to the point that it had moved offices to protect the integrity of its staff - the company is suggesting the introduction of a 1.5 percent levy charged on rides to drivers in order to finance the improvement of the public transport network, similarly to what it does in Mexico.\n\nWhile it tried to bargain its permanence in Brazil, Uber disclosed that there are 500,000 users of the service across the four Brazilian capitals where it operates.\n\nThere are Bills against the app being voted in all these state capitals - and 13 other capitals where Uber doesn't operate yet have already presented similar projects that secure the exclusivity of public transport provision to the means authorized by the government.\n\nWhile taxi drivers argue that there is no need to add more cars to the public transport system as the current fleet is sufficient to meet the needs to the population, Uber executives have been quoted as saying that legislators want to ban the service in favor of corporate interests.\n\nThe start-up has criticized the government's willingness to ban the app rather than debating it. It also maintains that the current regulations are focused on taxi services and that there is no regulation of individual transport services - and the absence of such regulations doesn't make Uber illegal."},

It's the land of samba, deadly caipirinha cocktails, soccer legends, and beaches that go on forever \u2014 right?\n\nThis is all true, but there is a lot more to this country than meets the eye. Brazil managed to ride out the global economic slowdown, for a start. Though the GDP growth in Brazil is now fairly modest compared to 2010, it's still positive \u2014 which is more than what most mature and developed economies can say.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t know about the vibrant technology industry in Brazil, then you should \u2014 and I hope this blog will be a place you will regularly return to as I'm going to be reporting on what's happening across all areas of technology.\n\nAt the end of 2012, the Brazilian software and IT services business employed over 600,000 people, creating revenues of $71.6 billion. This is not an industry that has sprung up overnight to take on the IT outsourcers in India. The IT industry has been around for decades in Brazil, going through the same growth cycle as that of the USA, from enormous mainframes to PCs, tablets, and semiconductors.\n\nThis is a mature industry that has generally existed under the radar of the rest of the world because most of the business was taking place locally. Government or local companies have been commissioning big IT projects with local players. But now, the Brazilian market has become so attractive, every IT supplier from Boston to Bangalore is making inroads and learning how to sell to Brazilian CIOs.\n\nLast year, over 35,000 Brazilian students graduated from higher education courses focused in some way on IT services, more than half of them in the densely populated south east of the country. But even with a larger number of students taking technology courses, one of the main IT trade bodies in Brazil, Apeti, predicts that by 2020, there will be a deficit of around 220,000 IT professionals in the country.\n\nThe eyes of the world are really on Brazil at present. The FIFA soccer world cup is in Brazil next year, and the famous Maracan\u00e3 stadium just reopened last week after several years of renovation. The Olympic games will come to Rio in 2016. And Brazil is a leading member of the Brics, which is starting to become a global force in world trade with the recently announced Brics development bank.\n\nAre you working in IT and looking for a new opportunity? How about learning Portuguese and heading south to try taking one of those jobs? This isn't a market where people are just glad to have a job in IT. This is a place where group buying and crowd sourcing is normal, and social network adoption is second only to the USA. And there are just not enough IT experts to go around."},

Bondsy, a social network for friendly transactions,\u00a0was created by Brazilian advertising veteran Diego Zambrano as he moved from Rio de Janeiro to work in New York in 2007.\n\nThe short story is that since Zambrano started Bondsy in 2011, he has managed to raise $750,000 in funding for his \"social network for things\" and amassed a legion of followers who are keen on the online bartering concept.\n\nBondsy connects friends and friends of friends, who can use the platform to sell or trade their unwanted items or receive payments \"in kind\" for them: an example could be swapping an old bike for dancing lessons or home-cooked chilli.\u00a0The USA and Brazil are the largest markets for Bondsy at present, but the company's main focus is to grow its user base globally.\n\nBondsy started out of an actual necessity. Prior to his move to the US, Zambrano decided to donate or sell all of his belongings to friends, but could not find any tool that was designed for the purpose.\n\nThe entrepreneur ended up using Flickr to get rid of his possessions, but it was clear that there was a gap in the market as two trends could be observed.\n\n\"My friends shared that page [with the items for donation/sale] with their friends, who then felt comfortable enough to get in touch with me. And other friends also offered to pay in kind - with dinners, beers and so on. I even swapped a camera for a dinner that was more expensive than the camera itself,\" he says.\n\n\"While this improvisation [with Flickr] worked well, it was far from being a perfect solution. I ended up fascinated about that problem and have studied it for years; then I decided to create a platform to cater for that sort of behaviour.\"\n\nZambrano's pitch to his backers was his personal story and his vision of how to address the market gap he identified.\n\n\"I was lucky enough to find investors who shared and believed in my vision,\" he points out.\n\nIn pratical terms, however, Bondsy's creator faced all manner of initial difficulties - including lack of fluency in English, not having the right contacts, or a Green Card to start a company.\n\n\"As an entrepreneur, you need to be very passionate about a problem and be obstinate, because there will be plenty of obstacles along the way,\" says Zambrano.\n\n\"When I gave up on my career in advertising, I had no idea of how I was going to put Bondsy together; I simply jumped in. In many moments, you just have to trust that everything will be OK,\" he adds.\n\n\"The biggest challenge is starting. There is a general belief that if you take risks and it doesn't work out, the worst possible scenario is that you will become homeless - in reality, the worst case scenario is not as bad and if you can face it, you are free to try whatever you want.\"\n\nZambrano wants Bondsy to stay true to its original motto, \"no strangers.\" This means that items are relevant to users because they have been posted by friends or their network.\n\n\"We are also working on some new features that will improve that experience even more,\" the company's founder says.\n\nAs the app becomes more popular in the US and Brazil, Zambrano points out that different ways in which users in the two countries can be observed.\n\n\"Brazil is an extremely criative and diverse country and that is reflected on the way in which Brazilians use the platform: people are using it to swap handwritten letters, old objects, home-cooked food, concert tickets, but also to sell items such as clothes, films, electronics and so on,\" he says.\n\n\"In the US, the main behavior pattern is to give things for free or in return for experiences, while people in Brazil are more focused on actually selling things. Increasingly, I see Brazilians opening up for different types of transactions.\"\n\nSimilarly to what has happened on Pinterest, Brazilian companies are also flocking to Bondsy to sell their items - for money, of course. Despite the fact that the platform was not designed for that purpose, Zambrano is not averse to the idea and says that his company is learning from new trends developing within the user base.\n\nAs a response to its popularity in Brazil, Bondsy will launch a version of its mobile app in Portuguese soon. The start-up is based in Brooklyn, New York, and employs fours staff, but if a Brazil base is needed in order to improve the local user experience, the possibility will be considered.\n\nJudging by how long it took for Zambrano to mature his idea - and how long it has taken to grow his striking long hair and beard, untouched since 2009 - figuring out the right way to make money is a process to which the entrepreneur is devoting a lot of time and effort.\n\n\"Monetization will come at the right time.

As a result, the roads are packed full with buses - and car ownership in Brazil rose 32 percent to 7.4 million during the past decade, which partly explains why S\u00e3o Paulo is often nicknamed \"the city of 19 million traffic jams.\"\n\nTo try and tackle these acute urban mobility issues, the Mayor's office will be promoting a hackathon this\u00a0coming weekend (October 26-27) to develop\u00a0applications focused on the provision of public transport in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nThe participants will follow a list of demands and needs of public transport users that have been identified by the government; criteria will include the creativity and technical quality of the applications created over the weekend. There will be money prizes of R$ 8,000 ($3,674), R$ 4,000 ($1,837)\u00a0and R$ 3,000 ($1,377)\u00a0for the top three proposals.\n\nThe applications will be created using the data made available by SPTrans, S\u00e3o Paulo's public transport authority, since last week. This is significant because until now, only Google has had access to that information, which includes bus routes, timetables and real-time positioning of the buses.\n\nAny user, Brazilian or foreign, can sign up to use the data after agreeing to a simple set of guidelines that can be found here.\n\nMy own idea - crowdsourcing bus maps in S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nMost bus stops in S\u00e3o Paulo are just simple shelters or just wooden poles with no information at all about the itineraries or timetables. With that in mind, I have tried submitting the idea of crowdsourcing a visual representation of itineraries using the design of the London bus maps - most commonly known as \"spider maps.\"\n\nThe idea was submitted exactly two years ago to the Gilberto Kassab administration and I worked on that for nearly six months. The plan was to get an IT company willing to put together a map-building system with various social features for free, so the citizens of S\u00e3o Paulo would use lego-style building blocks based on the London spider maps, to create a real map of bus routes, add points of interest around it, build bespoke routes according to interest and so on. The information entered would be edited by other users, Wikipedia-style.\n\nThese maps would then be available online and also as physical maps available at bus stops. As well as getting that crowdsourced access to information, the reward for the citizens would be to see credits on the maps, as designers and editors would get credits.\n\nIn our plan, the IT company supplying the map-building system would get some kind of marketing support printed on the maps, but the real carrot was\u00a0the kudos of running a major civic project that could later be referenced.\n\nMy husband and I then sought permission from Transport for London, the London transport authority to use the map design, which was granted at no cost to S\u00e3o Paulo - and Mayor Boris Johnson thought the collaboration was a great idea, so we thought we had enough backing to get the idea off the ground.\n\nAfter presenting the idea, we had several meetings with the S\u00e3o Paulo city government, the city's transport body SPTrans and the British Consulate, who was representing the London Mayor's office in the discussions.\n\nWhile the transport body's marketing people thought this would be a perfect way to change people's perceptions of the public transport administration by empowering them, the IT management of SPTrans talked of the complexity of the system in S\u00e3o Paulo - over 10 million bus journeys daily, several thousand individual bus routes, routes changing quite often...\n\nAt the start of 2012, we gave up on the project when it became obvious that some of those stakeholders would not enable us to proceed. We asked three things:\n\n1. The information on bus itineraries, route numbers and so on. This was something that was provided to Google, with people at SPTrans almost solely dedicated to that task, on a weekly basis;\n\n2. Agreement to go ahead and release a tender to find an IT company willing to build and host the system - the draft RFI we have submitted (in Portuguese) can be found here;\n\n3. Marketing of the initiative across the communications channels of the public transport network, to get people interested in helping out.\n\nAt the time, it seemed impossible to get SPTrans to release the same data they were providing to Google, due to \"security concerns.\" We then made a very last attempt to salvage the work that had been done over those six months and suggested that the bus data be open for all and promote a hackathon amongst high school students at technical state schools. All we heard from the marketing department at that stage was that the IT team was not willing to help.\n\nFunnily enough, in all those meetings with government officials, the recurring question was: \"what's in it for you?\". They could not believe that me and my husband would devote time, contacts and expertise without any monetary compensation.\n\nThe answer always was that ever since the idea came about the intention was to help the city - and not just those who own internet-enabled smartphones but all bus users, by printing crowdsourced maps that could be used anywhere in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nSo the efforts from the new administration to open public transport data and get citizens involved were great news to hear, despite of my previous experience. Now, anyone will be able to create something valuable for all without any need for endless meetings, internal politics and red tape. And that is real progress."},

We talked to Correios about the initiative.\n\nCorreios is one of the biggest state-owned companies in Brazil and employs more than 115,000 people across the country, with a massive IT infrastructure supporting its operations.\u00a0According to government ministers, the development of online security products such as digital certificates had been an area of focus at Correios in the last couple of years, so the project is not a knee-jerk reaction to the NSA episodes.\n\nThe postal service maintained an email system for end users, CorreiosNet, which was phased out earlier this year. So clearly the idea was not to return to that space - that is, until they the organization was tasked with scoping out the national email service.\n\nAccording to the vice president of IT and infrastructure at Correios, Antonio Luiz Fuschino, the initial idea is to reuse the foundations of a \"digital correpondence system\" which has been developed since 2012, but as a corporate service.\n\n\"The Ministry of Communications asked Correios to look into the feasibility of offering that service to citizens for free,\" Fuschino said.\n\n\"We have technical structure and skills to build for the development of the system, but we may also bring more personnel in and start partnerships,\" he added, in an indication that Correios will have to scale up its IT operations if the service becomes a reality.\n\nAccording to Fuschino, the organization is figuring out the costs involved in offering email servces to an online population of more than 100 million people.\n\n\"Costs will be met through partnerships and advertising, just like other email services that are already available.\"\n\nThe future email service would use encryption to prevent content from being read by anyone but the intended recipients and data will be hosted in datacenters located in Brazil.\n\nWill citizen data really be safer if it is stored away from the prying eyes of other countries? The government believes that is going to be the case, but industry observers are not so sure about that.\n\n\"Storing data in Brazil should, in theory, make it more difficult for external parties to access information. But there is never a 100 percent guarantee - you often see instances in Brazil where people have been able to access to tax information, which is held by the government and should be safe,\" says IDC telecoms analyst Jo\u00e3o Paulo Bruder.\n\nIs Correios the most appropriate department to handle a public email service along the lines of Gmail? In theory, yes, because since 2011 the company is allowed to provide digital services.\n\nThe Brazilian government also owns Serpro, the Federal Data Processing Service, which is the country's largest public IT organisation and provides services including tax self-assessment tools, national insurance and driving license records to name a few.\n\n\"Correios does not have expertise in terms of email management, but I suppose that is not what this is about: whoever manages this [service] gets more political power,\" says IDC's Bruder.\n\nHowever, the government's opinion is that since Correios is responsible for the delivery of physical letters and parcels, it should also be accountable for email - which, in their view, is just another type of correpondence.\n\nIs the creation of a locally-hosted \u00a0email system the best way to protect data?

They have seen the recent violence on the streets of many cities in Brazil and questioned how safe it might be to live here. I have even had some emails alluding to me being irresponsible for promoting Brazil when it\u2019s such a \"dangerous\" place to be right now - how on Earth could I be the cheerleader of the technology industry of such a basket case?\n\nI think that using the term \"dangerous\" is overstating the present situation. And I don\u2019t think that it is irresponsible to talk about the opportunities available in the Brazilian technology sector. The opportunities are real and the people who are on the streets protesting are trying to create an even better, more transparent Brazil.\n\nBrazil is a country that respects democracy and the right to protest. The people want answers from the politicians because major events like the World Cup and Olympic games are coming to the country soon, but our education and health service both need investment before sport. And almost a third of the elected politicians who make all these spending decisions are also waiting to stand trial on various criminal charges \u2013 can you imagine that in your own country?\n\nBut the rule of law is important in Brazil. There is no anarchy or chaos despite what the news cameras may imply. Life goes on in all the major cities even as people protest. The Pope is visiting Rio this week and millions of young people have travelled to attend the events around the World Youth Day. The buses are still running. My postman is still delivering letters and the bars are still full every evening.\n\nFor all the talk in the height of the protests that the people on the street would force the president from office there has been no serious challenge to her position. Most people in Brazil want to see fairer more transparent politics, but the majority do not want that forced on society by people on the streets smashing up banks - the same banks that lend to small businesses and create new jobs.\n\nThe reality is that this is not an Arab Spring or an Egyptian uprising \u2013 we already live in democratic society - but the citizens of a nation joining together and exercising their right to protest. It started off because people were unhappy about an increase in the bus prices in S\u00e3o Paulo and escalated because the police reacted violently to that protest. The people really do have a voice in Brazil and foreign observers should be celebrating this.\n\nBut would people in the international technology industry be scared of coming to work in Brazil or investing here just because the Brazilian people are prepared to go out and complain about the government? This demand for transparency and information about government decision-making is demonstrating that IT can lead the way in improving society \u2013 as well as underpinning most corporate enterprises today.\n\nAsk yourself a few questions about the kind of place that you want to live, if you think that the Brazilian people complaining about how the government spends their cash is unsettling.\u00a0The next World Cup is in Russia and the one after that is in Qatar. I don\u2019t expect you will hear about many street protests related to the government spending on the World Cup in these countries.\n\nBusiness is still booming in Brazil. The IT opportunity is soaring, businesses such as Twitter and LinkedIn are all placing their bets on their operations here and that's not just because of the World Cup and Olympics. There is growth and IT innovation in Brazil even as the European market stagnates.\n\nBrazil remains a safe place to do business and to work, with a myriad of opportunities for technologists and innovators - companies are actually crying out for people with those skills here. The rule of law is important to all Brazilians including those who are protesting about crooked politicians. We want justice, not anarchy, and a more open government will come soon, because Brazil is a free and open society where the people are allowed a voice \u2013 and that\u2019s the kind of place I want to work.

However, nothing concrete has come out of these investigations.\n\nOver the last few weeks, Rousseff's government has also rushed to announce a barrage of measures to protect the country's information, such as the purchase of its first satellite and the voting of the country's \"Internet Constitution\" .

It can take months from the moment Anatel authorizes a device until it actually hits the high street.\n\nThere have been occasions where other bodies get in the way.

The third pillar, Violations of User Rights, includes surveillance, privacy, and repercussions for online activity, such as imprisonment.\n\nReported cases across various of these research areas meant that the Brazilian index fell from 27 in 2012 to 32 this year \u2014 meaning the country has gone from \"free\" on the internet to \"partly free.\"\n\nFreedom House has listed a range of developments that took place between May 2012 and April 2013 that prompted the decline in online freedom.\n\nThese include the obstacles to widespread adoption of end-user internet services , which has been hindered by high costs, low quality, and regional infrastructural disparity;\n\nLegal action connected to content removal by the judiciary and government officials, such as the Facebook outage threat last week \u2014 according to the report, this is becoming an increasingly common trend and could become a possible barrier to free speech.\n\nHigh-profile cases of intermediary liability are also featured in the report, including criminal charges against Google executives in 2012 and 2013 for failure to remove content prohibited under electoral law, which are still pending.\n\nThe changes to the Marco Civil Bill \u2014 originally intended to serve as a \"Constitution for the Internet,\" \u00a0guaranteeing freedom of expression, net neutrality, and the right to privacy \u2014 which leaves users in a climate of legal uncertainty also prompted the decline of Brazil in the online freedom chart.\n\nCases of threats, intimidation, and violence against online journalists and bloggers, which appears to bear a clear link to content they posted online have also been mentioned in the report. This, according to the watchdog, negatively impacts freedom of expression and has the potential to encourage self-censorship.\n\nThe report also points out that episodes linked to online press over the last year have resulted in Brazil becoming one of the world\u2019s five deadliest countries for media professionals."},

In a late-night court session yesterday, Facebook backed down and promised to remove the uploaded photographs that were at the centre of the dispute.\n\nThe crisis is over \u2013 for now. And yet another Judge has enjoyed his few minutes in the media spotlight by taking on a social media leviathan.\n\nBut where does this leave Brazil?\n\nBrazilian legislators are starting to look more than a little out of touch with the way the world functions when a simple dispute over Facebook can spiral into a case that could have closed off the social network to the entire country.\n\n\n\nFacebook pleaded that they merely carry the content that users upload and they already have procedures in place to deal with offensive content such as pornography. The firm's argument is that a messenger is very different to a publisher \u2013 in the same way that your national post office is not responsible or accountable when they deliver offensive or illegal material in the mail.\n\n\n\nFacebook also argued that its legal entities are located outside of Brazil \u2013 in the US and Ireland \u2013 and should not therefore be called in front of a Brazilian court to answer questions about content uploaded by Brazilian users. However, the judge in the center of the latest dispute, R\u00e9gis Rodrigues Bonvicino, said: \"If Facebook operates in Brazil, it is subject to Braziian laws.\"\n\nThe judge also cited the recent news that President Dilma Rousseff and the energy company Petrobras had been subject to surveillance by the US government. Once again making it appear that he was more interested in seeing how many times his name might appear online rather than making any serious connection between the cases.\n\nIt is utterly ridiculous that this case should have been brought to this point and for the judge to be talking of a dispute between neighbours and international espionage in the same breath. It can be difficult to police the content on some social networks \u2014\u00a0any celebrity that has suffered abuse by trolling knows this \u2014 but national laws such as slander or libel can still be applied locally. These networks are even able to accommodate very specific government requests, such as the German ban on Nazi iconography.\n\nNetworks such as Facebook are not just places for kids to share the latest\u00a0One Direction\u00a0video. Millions of people now depend on social networks to communicate with their family, find a job, and even to perform their job.\n\nIf the Brazilian courts think that they can just switch Facebook on and off at will then perhaps they should start explaining this attitude to companies like Coca Cola, who communicate regularly with 74 million of their customers using Facebook. Even Petrobras has recently posted on their Facebook page that one of the best things about their 60th birthday was seeing that they now have over a million fans on Facebook.\n\nThese networks are now stitched into the fabric of our society and Brazil is second only to the US in the adoption of social networking. Our representatives in the Brazilian legislature urgently need to understand that the free flow of information is a critical part of our national infrastructure.\n\nFor us to still have lawmakers who do not understand the tools of the twenty-first century makes us look like a laughing stock \u2014 and that\u2019s a serious problem when investment flows to societies that are free and open, not those who will shut down social networks overnight."},

The Raspberry Pi creators added that they have not selected, or even reviewed, any manufacturing partners - and that can be a \"significant lengthener of timescales.\"\n\n\"Our experience in setting up manufacturing, initially in China and later here in the UK, suggests that Christmas would be an extremely optimistic goal: there's negotiation, sourcing, plant, distribution and a ton of contractual work that would need doing before we could even make a start,\" said Liz Upton, co-founder at the Raspberry Foundation.\n\nPete Lomas, another Raspberry Pi co-founder, visited Brazil in February for technology and innovation event Campus Party, where he met hundreds of Pi fans and talked about the potential of Brazil as a market for the technology.\n\nBut access to the credit card-sized computers - which have a demand that is vastly superior to its production capacity - is a problem to the Brazilian Pi community, as well as price: the $35 computer would cost R$80 in Brazil on a straight currency conversion, but high tariffs mean it ends up costing about R$180 to final consumers.\n\nSo there is clearly an audience for the computers, but the Foundation will have to first overcome the hurdles involved in making them in Brazil.\n\n\"We are definitely looking at Brazil as our next manufacturing location \u2013 it's an important market for us with a real creative appetite for computer education,\" Lomas said.\n\n\"But these things take time and resources which, as a charity, we have to be very careful with, so we're moving carefully and considering the best ways to make the transition, all of which takes time.\""},

In S\u00e3o Paulo, for example, the 3G network coverage dropped at the starting point of the latest large protest, affecting several thousand participants.\n\nThree of the biggest mobile operators in the country \u2014 Claro, Tim, and Vivo \u2014 told technology website Olhar Digital that the issues were due to the number of users simultaneously accessing the network in the same area. But issues were also faced in other places where the number of protesters was not nearly as huge as in S\u00e3o Paulo: Technology blog Tecmundo reported that in Curitiba, a much smaller capital, many users were also struggling to make calls, send text messages, or access the web.\n\nThe incident even sparked rumors that the military police had been using signal blockers to deliberately create communication problems for the protesters, who could not contact their peers or post content about the events online.\n\nTo work around the lack of connectivity, protesters who could get intermittent access to the web began to ask people who live or work in the area to open up access to their wi-fi networks. A collaborative map also helped protesters find open wi-fi hotspots.\n\nConspiracy theories aside, the mobile coverage \"blackouts\" highlight a problem that is just not showing signs of improvement. Mobile telephony in Brazil is not only among the most expensive in the world, but also plain inefficient; I am constantly reminded of that when my signal drops during a phone call, when I get my service interrupted for hours for no reason at all, when I have to pay roaming charges for making calls within the same state where I am based. The list goes on.\n\nSince we are protesting about all the problems Brazil has been sweeping under the carpet for years, how about we add that to the list?

Altenhofen is then said to have retaliated by driving into Gondim's garage and posting abusive content about him on Facebook, which seems to have attracted a fair amount of support.\n\nDespite Gondim's claims that Altenhofen's supposed hate campaign was a threat to his safety given the concerted trolling, threats by animal activists, and publication of his personal details, Facebook Brazil refused to take the posts down, making the point that it is not responsible for the content and infrastructure management of the website.\n\nThat, according to the company, is the job of Facebook Ireland and Facebook Inc., which is based in the US.\n\nFacebook's response caused uproar, with Bonvicino saying that the firm's stance was \"an outrageous disregard to the sovereignty of Brazil\" and is \"compounded by notorious and official spying by the US government.\" He added that \"the order of a judge, recorded in a legal process, is an integral part of the country's sovereignty.\"\n\nIf Facebook does not comply with the requirements, telecom operators Embratel, Telefonica, Vivo, Globalcross, Level 7 and Brazil Telecom will be forced to block all the Facebook.com IP domains across the Americas I, II Americas, Atlantis II, Emergia \u2014\u00a0SAM I GlobalCrossing, Global net and Unisur cabling networks tomorrow.

It ignores the fact that thousands of Brazilian businesses rely on the platform and the communities within it to sell their products, to interact with their audiences, to recruit. It's more or less the same as receiving death threats over the post then demanding that the postal service be shut down \u2014\u00a0you just shoot the messenger.\n\nThis is not the first time that Brazil mimics countries such as China, Iran and North Korea, where Internet censorship is enforced.\n\nBack in 2007, You Tube was taken down in Brazil due to another legal case featuring yet another model who got upset about a certain saucy video of her and a boyfriend at a beach in Spain.\u00a0And, even though the authorities eventually came to their senses and subsequently ordered the unblocking of the service, the bad impression left by that episode clearly displayed how freedom of expression is fragile in this country.

It is understood that some companies will also be able to operate from the office.\n\nApex Brasil president Mauricio Borges says the government's presence in Silicon Valley will be helpful to Brazilian start-ups as the experiences in the US could be implemented in their own business plans: \"Brazil will go [to Silicon Valley] to learn, get to know [people] and also to show its potential in technology and innovation,\" he adds.\n\nOn the same day of the launch of the Brazilian government's Silicon Valley base, a conference will be held in San Francisco to discuss Brazil's investment potential as a center of excellence in technology and innovation. Speakers at the event will include Brazilian entrepreneurs and private equity and investment associations, as well as Brazil and US government representatives and companies such as Google, Facebook and LinkedIn .\n\nAlso this week, another initiative also focused on supporting tech entrepreneurs is talking place. The Tech Mission 2013, organized by entrepreneurship network Brazil Innovators and supported by Apex Brasil, has taken a group of 11 technology-based companies to the Silicon Valley.\n\nDuring the six days of the programme, these Brazilian founders of start-ups from various stages will be meeting and greeting Silicon Valley moguls and looking to attract investment. The idea is to also disseminate an entrepreneurial culture in Brazil, since all participants will continue to take part in the events and networking provided by Brazil Innovators back home.\n\nEntrepreneurs supported by the Tech Mission this year include Meu Carrinho, a mobile price comparison website, online payments firm Moip and Colab, a social network that enables interaction between citizens and government representatives, through the submission of proposals and evaluation of public services."},

The debate has since become broader to include other issues, from the rampant corruption in Brazil to the lack of investment in basic infrastructure and the modus operandi of the military police.\n\nOn Twitter, as well as the \"official\" hashtags of the protests #changebrazil and Portuguese variable #mudabrasil, the tag #protestosp has been employed by activists in S\u00e3o Paulo to propagate information from those on the ground \u2014 such as warnings about random police searches for vinegar, a substance used by protesters as relief for tear gas effects.\n\nTo debate the original discussion topic \u2014 the bus fare increase of R$0,20 ($0,09) \u2014 S\u00e3o Paulo-based activist group Movimento Passe Livre (Free Pass Movement, in Portuguese) has amassed a huge following on Facebook. Currently the most influential discussion group originating from the unrest, the movement is leading a major demonstration in S\u00e3o Paulo via the social network, which will take place later today (June 17), and had over 266,000 confirmed attendees at the time of writing.\n\nFacebook has played an important role in fostering citizen journalism, too. As major mass media vehicles continue to present a biased account of the facts, groups such as Vinegar Wars, a media center, launched over the weekend. With news curated by protesters, translation tasks are being crowdsourced for multi-lingual content production. The idea here is create an outlet in various languages to inform the international audience about what is going on.\n\nTumblr blogs are also amongst the initiatives intended to spread awareness. The blog \"O que n\u00e3o sai na TV\" (\"What doesn't show on TV\", in Portuguese) is a collection of multimedia content from the front line, as well as a public service central with information such as telephone numbers of volunteer lawyers who offered services to arrested activists.\n\nDiscussion lists on platforms such as Google have also been actively involved in the protests. Such groups include LuluzinhaCamp and FemMaterna, where the combined supporter base of several hundred women has organized itself to provide voluntary childcare facilities for the mothers willing to take part in the protest, food for the activists, and shared wi-fi access.\n\nAs occurrences such as sexual violence against female activists and unprovoked beatings at demonstrations perpetrated by the Brazilian police have become public, a location-based, mobile-friendly crowdmap powered by not-for-profit software developer Ushahidi was launched to report incidents across the country.\n\nOn a light-hearted note, tech-savvy protesters have also launched a Facebook game themed around the civil unrest. In \"V de Vinagre\" (\"V for Vinegar\", in Portuguese), is inspired in the \"V for Vendetta\" comic books, and has the objective of escaping the police with as many vinegar bottles as possible. The player can progress through the game levels that go from \"petty criminal\" to \"communist\".\n\nDo you know about other online resources used by activists in Brazil right now?

According to the latest ruling, that does not mean the Brazilian firm has copied any competitor - including Apple, since the iPhone was only launched in 2007.\n\nThe whole issue partly stems from the incredible delays in paperwork processing at the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI), which received Gradiente's trademark registration request in 2000 and only completed its analysis after eight years. INPI's bosses seem to be aware of the consequences of such lengthy processes around intellectual property and want Brazilian procedures to be similar to those seen in the United States.\n\nAs a compromise, Justice Eduardo Andr\u00e9 Brand\u00e3o de Brito Fernandes determined that Gradiente will be able to continue to use the iPhone trademark in its Android-based products, so long as it is accompanied by the Gradiente word - so mobile phones would be named Gradiente iPhone. Conversely, Apple will be able to continue to use the trademark iPhone for its devices in Brazil.\n\nThe judge added that if Gradiente was allowed to be the sole user of the iPhone name, Apple would be massively affected, since \"all the fame and loyalty to its product resulted from [Apple's] level of competence and degree of excellence. Thus, fragmenting the market in Brazil would represent a punishment for those who worked for the success of the product.\"\n\nThe debate over the iPhone trademark protection is intended to prevent unfair competition and that consumers make mistakes when buying mobile phones. On the other hand, the latest ruling points out that free competition is not absolute and unrestricted and that the establishment of limits and rules among competitors is there to prevent that unlimited freedom causes damages to businesses.\n\nIGB Electronica, which controls Gradiente, said it would appeal the court's decision."},

Any legislation should have more of a macro focus on the use of data to ensure that it stays within these companies and prevents criminals, or other companies, from accessing that data. If the public is not worried about where their Gmail information physically resides, then why should the government intervene?\n\nThat said, even the enforcement of stricter rules regarding data protection do not mean that our information is safe. While legislation can help create a safer environment on the web, the law is never going to be ahead of the technology.\n\n\"There are no guarantees [that personal data can be kept safe] - the government, Google, Facebook and others can show that they are adhering to guidelines and that they are transparent, but any standards you might want to apply can't keep up with the pace of change,\" Beer says.\u00a0 The expert added that that he fears the Marco Civil might be voted as a knee-jerk reaction to the NSA spying episode from last month. He cited the Carolina Dieckmann law as an example - a set of basic regulations around online privacy introduced after issues faced by Dieckmann, a Brazilian actress who had personal photos stolen from her computer and then published online. Brazilian politicians might be just reinventing the wheel. The US Department of Commerce and European Commission have had agreements in place on data protection since the 1980s. The EC Directive on Data Protection has been around since 1998. The basic work in trying to create a framework for the protection of personal data has already been done.\n\nInstead of knee-jerk legislation that could affect business in Brazil for many years to come, the Brazilian government should explore what other countries have been doing for decades \u2013 take what works and discard what doesn\u2019t.

If found guilty, the South Korean firm will have to pay $250mi ($107mi) in damages to its employees.\n\nAccording to the authorities, some 2,000 employees had to take sick leave of up to 2 weeks in 2012 alone, due to issues such as back problems and repetitive strain injury. This is hardly surprising given the requirements of the production line: a staff member has only 65 seconds to assemble a television, while a mobile phone is put together in under 33 seconds.\n\nIt is not the first time that Samsung has been in trouble in Brazil over poor working conditions. In September 2011, the company had to pay R$ 500,000 ($214,000) in damages to employees at a facility in Campinas, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nThe issues in Campinas were very similar to those seen in Manaus. At the time, employees described the working environment at Samsung as terrifying, with threats issued by managers when complaints were made. The company paid the fine and agreed to make the adjustments required by the government and Samsung should present evidence that the changes have been made to the Court this month.\n\nHave we seen it all before?\n\nA US-based NGO, China Labor Watch, has compared the working conditions at Samsung with the situation seen in China at Apple's manufacturer Foxconn. But this is different - Apple had a service contract with Foxconn, who treated its employees poorly despite telling their client that labor regulations would be respected. This is not to say that Apple wasn't also at fault, but the company treated the situation in a transparent manner and Tim Cook made sure that he was seen flying to China to demand changes. Requirements were raised so the bar was set higher across its entire supply chain and the Fair Labor Association got involved in the process.\n\nWith Samsung in Brazil, it is a different story. In this case there is no outsourced contractor to blame - we are talking about poor working conditions at their own factories. When questioned about the latest lawsuit, Samsung sent me a one-paragraph statement, which said that it is \"committed to providing a workplace that adheres to the highest standards in the industry in relation to safety, health and wellbeing\" and that it will fully cooperate with the Brazilian authorities when notified.\n\nWell, if I were part of the Samsung management team in Brazil, I would be praying for a miracle. As the sheen has started fading from Apple, Samsung appears poised to become the most important phone manufacturer in the world, but consumers don\u2019t like companies that use dangerous or abusive factories to churn out new products.\n\nBrazil is one of the biggest markets in the world for Samsung. They need to manage their reaction to this situation carefully because Brazil also has the most switched-on and social consumers outside of the USA. If Samsung don\u2019t deal with the accusations of slave labor in Brazil then these local consumers - who have recently managed to get laws changed through protests organized via social media \u2013 are likely to arrange a product boycott.\n\nIn short, Samsung may find that their problems in Brazil have only just begun if they can\u2019t reassure the public quickly that this behavior was in error."},

The article suggests that systematic tapping of the telecoms network has led to the collection of emails and telephone records of millions of Brazilians over the last decade.\n\nThere are no specific numbers, but the article says that about 2,3 million phone calls and messages in Brazil were monitored in January alone.\n\nEver since the NSA spying scandal became public, Brazilian authorities have followed the subject. However the\u00a0debate has become a lot more serious since yesterday, as the allegations are directly related to Brazil and include not only implications around international communications, but also information on local exchanges.\n\nThe O Globo story also implies that Fairview, the company that collects data across communications networks worldwide on the NSA\u2019s behalf could be commercially involved with Brazilian telecom operators to get access to private information.\n\n\u201cEvidently [the possible involvement of Brazilian telcos with the NSA] changes the debate, and if that\u2019s the case we are dealing with a crime, as the constitution assures data privacy to all, whether it is in a traditional or digital format,\u201d communications minister Paulo Bernardo told Radio Estad\u00e3o today.\n\n\u201cSo we will investigate that possibility. And I repeat: if we find that this is the case, [the companies involved] will be held responsible. Internationally speaking, we have asked for an explanation from the US and have requested action from international bodies to assure cyber security and privacy to contain that sort of thing,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister also accepted that the telcos will probably say they have nothing to do with the spying activities, so wheels are already in motion to start a police investigation on the matter \u2013 which also involves new rumours that Brazil has maintained a data collection facility in the country alongside the NSA.\n\nThe Brazilian government wants explanations from the US, but they won't be getting any: the Department of State in the US already told BBC Brazil that it will not comment on any specific intelligence activities.\n\nAccording to a note released by the presidential office, president Dilma Rousseff wants to push an agenda of improvement of rules on telecommunications security with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and launch initiatives alongside the United Nations \"to prevent the invasion of privacy of users of virtual networks of communication (...) that protect citizen rights and preserve the sovereignty of all countries. \"\n\nThe Brazilian government is worried about the possibility of monitoring in a local political, commercial and industrial sense - to the point the possibility of implementation and cost of a national data warehousing system, as well as the creation of an internet act were among the options was being considered by Dilma and her team at an emergency meeting on Sunday.\n\nThe surprised reaction of the Brazilian government to these events illustrate the fragile state of Brazil in relation to dealing with business and civil rights on the internet: examples include t he recent regulation of basic principles of e-commerce \u00a0\u2013 this being a market that generated $11bi last year alone \u2013 and the relative absence of data security frameworks, which makes Brazil\u00a0 one of the worst places in the world in which to host a datacenter.\n\nTypically, when faced with some sort of tech-related crisis such as the NSA spying, the immediate reaction of the Brazilian government is to create an emergency solution. In this particular situation, the government is looking hopelessly immature, both in terms of its existing policies and in terms of what it is asking the ITU and the UN \u2013 rules to regulate the web.\n\nThis is the start of a long debate and there is no easy answer to the current issues. Brazil is learning the hard way that it needs to play some serious catch up when it comes to its technology policies \u2013 but holding private companies to account in the event of illegal cyber operations would be a good place to start."},

According to reports, the actual tendering process will then be launched in the next few weeks, with a view to start implementation before year end.\n\nOne of the trials at a prison in S\u00e3o Paulo involved systems from local software firm Innovatech, which blocks the signal from GSM devices of push-to-talk radio devices, which are popular in Brazil due to their lower-cost plans. The Innovatech package of software and hardware costs about R$600,000 ($264,000) acccording to Gizmodo.

The project has several variables to be considered, including distance from urban centers, topography and other factors.\n\nIntroducing cell phone denial technology in prisons is something that has been discussed and promised by authorities in S\u00e3o Paulo for a long time.\n\nInterestingly, during trials at the Mogi das Cruzes prison - carried out without the knowledge of the inmates - it was observed that in three days, there were 23 attempts to call the customer services line of one of the providers. The cell phone jamming tech allows the calls to be made and creates logs with the call information, but prevents their completion.\n\nThe data, provided by the Secretary of Penitentiary Administration, also highlighted that during nine days of trials in the Mogi prison, over 1,500 sim cards were detected.

This prompted the company to review its sales targets for the year: rather than 500.000 PCs and 150.000 tablets, the firm now expects to ship 450.000 PCs and 135.000 tablets this year.\n\nIn the first quarter of last year, Positivo reported losses of R$ 4.5m due to currency variations.

The proposals also include the creation of agreements with other countries to regulate international data flows and mechanisms to deal with occurrences of cybercrime.\n\n\"Brazil should have the ambition of becoming an important player in the cloud computing space as it has the potential to increase national competitiveness and productivity,\" Carneiro says in his proposal.\n\n\"So an adequate regulatory environment - which doesn't isolate the country, but offers security to citizens, enterprises and the government - is fundamental to foster the industry, bring more foreign investment in that field and allow Brazilian providers to expand internationally,\" he adds.\n\nIt is true that universally binding privacy laws does not exist and that countries where such laws have been adopted often struggle with reforms designed to respond to the advent of a global digital ecosystem. But the current unpreparedness of Brazil to deal with data-related matters is appalling.\n\nAs well as the inexistent privacy and cybercrime laws, Brazil hasn't signed the WIPO Copyright Treaty, meaning there are no regulations to protect new technology - and piracy is rampant here. A report by Cushman and Wakefield and hurleypalmerflatt published in 2012 also highlighted other concerns, including high energy prices and scarcity of skilled manpower, resulting in the conclusion that Brazil is currently one of the riskiest locations in the world in which to build a datacenter.\n\nThe proposals around cloud computing by the Brazilian politician, which are currently being analyzed by the Consumer Rights Commission of the government, are perhaps too wide-ranging, but are certainly the start of a much-needed debate. However, Mr Carneiro's path will be far from smooth: the congressman has expressed frustration about the fact his peers in the Chamber of Deputies have no idea what cloud computing is.\n\n\"No one understands even the most basic concept,\" the politician told Brazilian news portal iG.\n\nIf approved, the new measures will mean a huge advance in terms of Brazil's attractiveness in the global ICT market and also an update of the country's laws, which are seriously out of step with global standards on cybercrime and privacy.

Customers actually are adopting the cloud because at the end of the day, we continually reduce our prices,\" Carlson says.\n\n\"And if we can point to our customers and say that they have transformed their businesses and significantly reduce their cost with the use of AWS and cloud, that's what gets us excited because we have a long-term view of the business,\" she adds.\n\nCarlson points out that while AWS is sensitive to the economic challenges in Brazil, the company benefits from having experienced that before in several markets worldwide.\n\n\"We have the opportunity to see when economies are moving up. And unfortunately we also see when economies are not doing as well,\" the executive says.\n\n\"Right now, what we see for Brazil is that there's a massive opportunity to utilize cloud computing to create an economic opportunity for jobs, education, growth, innovation,\" she adds.\n\nCarlson says the focus in Brazil is to educate decision makers about the company's offering and that interactions with current and potential clients have been \"very open and transparent,\" particularly in the public sector.\n\n\"I found those meetings very refreshing because [government officials] are straightforward about the budget cuts, as well as things they need to do. I think that's all very positive for the country,\" Carlson says.\n\nSuch promising conversations included a visit to the governor of Brazil's capital Bras\u00edlia, who has publicized his interest in building a partnership with the cloud services provider in supporting new initiatives in transport, education and transparency.\n\n\"The meeting was very positive, especially because we're very new in Brazil for the public sector. That doesn't mean we don't have customers taking advantage of AWS already, but now we're building up a team. We have hires here and we're continuing to invest in the public sector,\" Carlson says.\n\n\"We are in the education phase and working with [public sector bodies] to help them think through how AWS could really be a key part of their solution and a game-changing element of their portfolios,\" she adds.\n\nFrost & Sullivan research suggests the Brazilian cloud computing market should see a jump in market revenues from $328.8m in 2013 to $1.1bn by 2017. According to Carlson, the bullish trend is helped by a shift in the software licensing model. She adds that during conversations with government customers, it became apparent that public sector users no longer want to buy a vast number of individual software licenses that they never use.\n\n\"[The cloud model] is a great opportunity because public sector users don't want to bear the high cost of licensing fees and that was clear to me,\" the executive says, adding that many government agencies in Brazil can't track the use of software licenses well.\n\nBeing able to deliver services to citizens more quickly is another requirement that government users have highlighted during conversations with AWS executives.\n\n\"They see cloud as an enabler to help their citizens. We didn't talk about budget around those conversations, though. It was much more a customer, citizen-driven conversation, things that people are asking for that need a solution,\" Carlson says.\n\nAccording to Carlson, even though AWS' operations are quite recent in Brazil, the brand Amazon has opened doors in terms of willingness from decision makers to do business with the company.\n\n\"When you have the brand and all the customer references that we can show, plus partners and analysts talking about it, it makes people think we are doing what should be done and that they should try our solutions.\"\n\nGetting closer to the community\n\nAnother way in which AWS is looking to get better known in Brazil is by bringing its education programs to the country. One such initiative is AWS Activate - a free program that provides startups with resources for working with the company's cloud-based tools.\n\nThe city of Florian\u00f3polis in southern Brazil is one of the public sector bodies currently using AWS Activate to educate more than 500 startups fostered by the Startup SC program on topics such as economics, marketing and social media using cloud-based tools.\n\nAccording to Carlson, the idea is to replicate the work that has been done in Florian\u00f3polis and introduce Activate to any government-sponsored start-up initiative.\n\n\"I love the idea of taking a commercial kind of program to a government initiative and mashing those together very nicely to create a program that allows for job creation,\" she says, adding that the program could be extended to the small and medium enterprise space.\n\n\"We see that if we can apply the same kind of thinking to the small and medium enterprises, it could be a phenomenal opportunity to create a model that can be replicated across Brazil.\"\n\nAnother program that will be brought to Brazil is AWS Educate, which is geared towards training for functions related to cloud computing. The company is now seeking partner institutions that might want to implement the content into their curricula.\n\nSince Pronatec - the Brazilian government's project to train entry-level professionals in technology roles - has been affected by the recent budget cuts, Carlson suggests that AWS could help re-shape the program.\n\n\"Maybe we can convince [the Brazilian government] that they need to rethink that project. There is no job in the future that will not have some coding and development and our goal is to educate people on high-level IT capabilities,\" the executive points out.\n\nCarlson is also a passionate advocate of gender inclusion in IT and will be looking for local partners to drive her project Smart is Beautiful to get young women interested in technology careers.\n\nAWS currently has clusters of datacenters spread across regions worldwide, including Brazil, the eighth launched by the company worldwide. Within this regional cluster there are three availability zones, isolated locations within regions connected by low-latency links that serve South America.\n\nAccording to Carlson, the company will continue to boost its local set-up in terms of infrastrcture and tools.\n\n\"You'll continue to see us add resources both in sales, marketing, PR, solution architects, technical support, business development support. So we'll deploy more resources as needed to support the environment,\" she says.\n\nCarlson expects that as local adoption rates go up, there will also be challenges.\n\n\"Through experience we know that it's either going to be some [new] policy that we need to work with the legislators on - and we do that all the time. It could be that the acquisition officials aren't well versed on how to deal with our models for cloud. We'll just have to go in and address that,\" she says.\n\n\"However, each and every agency we work with around the world goes through [challenges] and we face some of those, but we've not yet found one we can't get through: we're very tenacious and we don't run away from our problems,\" Carlson adds.\n\n\"It's a journey, and we are committed to get there. And we are not here for the short run. We are here for the long run.\""},

The first is the development of cybersecurity policies. According to the minister, a major target for the government within technology is to \"develop technology, knowledge and new systems that give more security to the operation of public and private sector networks in Brazil.\"\n\nThe Brazilian government announced in October that it\u00a0 is looking to invest in startups specializing in cybersecurity and defense so that it can be better prepared for future threats.\n\nAs part of this workstream, a two-day Global Conference on the Future of Internet Governance will be held in April. As the event name suggests, the idea is to create a global governance model for the Internet. Representatives of the academic and technology community, the public and private sector and the civil society are set to take part, as well as representatives from other countries.\n\nThe Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (CGI.br) would be the main partner in the activities around cybersecurity and governance.\n\nThe approval of the Science Code is another priority. The law proposal of the bill 2177/2011, also known as the \"Science Code\" is aimed at making researchers' lives simpler. This would be done by setting specific standards for less bureaucracy in technology research and greater flexibility throughout the process of planning and implementation of projects, particularly in areas such as equipment imports and contracting services. \"This new regulatory framework is essential to increase, facilitate and promote the activities of science, technology and innovation in the country,\" says minister Raupp.\n\nFunding for infrastructure supporting technology research is also on the government agenda. According to Raupp, some R$420mi ($178mi) of the federal sector-focused infrastructure budget were allocated to the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development. The money will continue to be invested in the implementation, modernization, expansion and refreshing the physical infrastructure of national research through public tenders. \"I'd say we were pretty consistent in channelling resources to public science and technology institutions in in 2013,\" the minister says.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Brazilian government will be ploughing resources into technology-focused government agencies. The creation of four Centers for Strategic Technologies focused on the Northeast, the Atlantic Rainforest and the Wetlands will go ahead this year, as well as another facility for water resources.\n\nRaupp took stock of the initiative to use advanced technology tools to monitor natural disasters across the country\u00a0throughout the country, launched last May. So far, some 934 automatic rain gauges were delivered, as well as 771 semiautomatic rain gauges and two weather radars.\n\n\"We are seeing the result now, during the current summer rain season,\" says Raupp.\u00a0\"We are avoiding deaths by alerting the authorities to take action when needed and mitigate the effects of these natural disasters. This is a social program of great importance, because landslides and floods happen every end of year and cause massive disruption to the population.\"\n\nAfter the shambolic launch of the Brazilian-Chinese satellite last year , Brazil now wants to build another one in 2014. The continuity of the Brazilian Space Program is a key item in Raupp's agenda and the launch of the new CBers series satellite, which was planned for 2015, will happen this year, according to the minister.\" We are accelerating the program of CBERS - 4 to compensate for the failure of CBers-3,\" Raupp says. Last year, the latest version of the satellite jointly developed by China and Brazil did not go into orbit due to technical issues in the launch vehicle.\n\nThe Brazilian government will also continue its educational, innovation and entrepreneurship programs focused on science, technology and innovation.\n\nKey programs the MCTI wants to continue putting resources into are Science without Borders, an international scholarship program focused on technology and science students - since its start in 2011, the initiative has given 60,000 out of the 101,000 scholarships it has set out to award until 2015 - as well as Plano Inova Empresa, an innovation grant to private sector companies with a cash pool of R$32.9mi ($14mi).\n\nRaupp also cited the progress made by Start-Up Brasil, the R$20mi ($8.4mi) initiative focused on backing entrepreneurs in Brazil and abroad - some 100 companies have been backed by the project so far, out of which 20 are from other countries. Further selection processes are expected to take place this year.\n\nAnother area of progress mentioned by Raupp is the creation of the training program Brasil Mais TI, which trained 103,000 people in 2013, as well as partnerships with global research and development centers of four companies including SAP. \u00a0The idea, according to the minister, is to continue these workstreams and exceed last year's targets."},

However, Martinelli points out that Kaspersky is aware of the differences between the latin markets, so some of these markets have also gained a certain degree of autonomy.\n\n\"Even though the other Latin American countries remain within the same business unit, it is important for them to be understood as a region that has different cultures and market peculiarities,\" says Martinelli.\n\nThe fact that Brazil has gained autonomy within Kaspersky is related not only to the positive sales performance in the country but also the strong e-commerce growth.\n\n\"Online commerce here is very mature and strong and the [business] volumes seen in Brazil are very different to other, smaller Latin American countries,\" the executive says.\n\n\"Brazil has not only become very representative within the Latin region in the last few years, but also for the organization as a whole: we understand that Brazil has a potential for growth that is superior to other regions in the world,\" Martinelli adds.\n\nSecurity investments have been small in Brazil until recently, according to Martinelli. The Kaspersky executive adds that this is now growing and all the attention that the country has been getting in the international media due to the World Cup and the Olympics has also attracted the attention of the cybercrime community - which is a problem that also creates more business for the company.\n\n\"It is natural that companies have started to get more concerned about their security investments and that more opportunities around investment will be found in Brazil in relation to the world average,\" Martinelli predicts.\n\nIn terms of target customers, Kaspersky is looking to generate business with multinational companies with a presence in Brazil, but also local companies.\n\n\"Many Brazilian organizations are looking to follow global security practices, bringing a type of investment behavior that was not very common,\" Martinelli says, adding that that Brazilian enterprises would typically invest half the world average of 5-6 percent of the IT budget in security.\n\nHowever, the security market in Brazil also has a range of well-established competitors such as Symantec, McAfee and Trend, all claiming a slice of that security pie, but Martinelli believes Kaspersky has what it takes to further establish its brand in the local market.\n\n\"It is a competitive space, but one where only a few [suppliers] have the service and solution capabilities that we offer in order to cater for individual and corporate consumers of any size, from small and medium enterprises to large-size corporations,\" Martinelli points out.\n\n\"Kaspersky Lab is the largest private company totally focused on digital security - this is our strength, our differential. We have a cybercrime division that has more than a thousand experts focused on solutions in that area, so our investigative work and development activities that are extremely focused on cyber threats does set us apart,\" he adds.\n\nThe main challenges facing the Brazilian division of the security company, according to its country head, are less to do with what the company considers a temporary economic downturn and more to do with creating a culture of proactive data security.\n\n\"A key challenge is around businesses' ignorance regarding those threats or what should be done so that companies can protect themselves: many honestly believe that the lightning will not fall on their heads, then relegate digital security to a second tier department or less strategic importance,\" Martinelli says.\n\n\"Also, there is no legislation in Brazil regarding cybercrime that protects customer information and requires companies to protect customer information, so it's all very vague.

The agency has also put together a working group to oversee the migration.\n\nFrom July, all new users must have an IPv6 address provided by Internet operators.

But client equipment such as modems and routers still needs to be upgraded, so that will require a gradual transition that should be ongoing until 2018.\n\nCurrently, Brazilian organizations can only get a maximum of 1024 IPv4 addresses every six months. This comes from the 2 million addresses which will be used to support the transition to IPv6. After that, there will be one final allocation of 2 million IPv4 addresses that can be provided to new companies in limited batches.\n\nCompanies have been dragging their heels on the issue of IPv4 exhaustion for years. According to Anatel, what has been hampering progress of the IPv6 migration in Brazil is the chicken-and-egg situation between operators and content generators - Internet portals, social networking platforms, search engines - over who should start migrating to the new protocol.\n\nWith the new deadlines, the agency believes that the deadlines imposed to the providers will mean that content generators will start working on it.\n\nCurrently, major Internet players such as Facebook and Google already operate with IPv6 content, as well as local companies such as portals UOL and Terra."},

Supporters of the Bill see the original text as a positive piece of legislation, which includes provisions across three key pillars: freedom of expression, net neutrality and privacy.\n\nFreedom of expression online: If voted in its original form, the regulations would guarantee the protection of freedom of expression and the right to privacy online . While there are fears that such measures could prompt a rise in piracy and publication of unlawful content in Brazil , the Marco Civil guarantees that users would only be identified with information on their communications disclosed at the request of a court order and limited to occasions where criminal investigations and prosecutions are taking place.\n\nLarge Brazilian media organizations such as Globo are understood to be strongly opposed to this.\n\nNet neutrality: The Marco Civil also determines that internet providers are required to treat all data that goes through their network in the same way. That in practice means operators would no longer be able to set higher or lower speeds according to individual internet usage patterns, load certain websites faster and also offer free access to certain content such as social networking tools while charging for others.\n\nThe Marco Civil also determines that the connection can not be suspended unless there is debt, and the company responsible for the connection is required to maintain the same quality of service on the same contract terms. The changes are clearly upsetting for the Brazilian telcos, who have been lobbying for years to ensure the current situation is maintained for fear of diminishing profits.\n\nPrivacy: After the recent scandal involving the NSA monitoring of emails of millions of Brazilians including President Dilma Rousseff , the government requested the inclusion of another provision in the Marco Civil, stating that the data of internet users has to be stored in Brazil.\n\nThis is controversial amongst large and small companies that rely heavily on cloud services that may not necessarily be hosted locally. Additionally, it can be argued that the changes will do nothing to prevent against the possibility of intrusive surveillance.\n\nWhat is happening now?\n\nThe president of the House of Representatives wants the Bill to be voted \"when there is more agreement\" between the various parties. Currently, there is still plenty of disagreement between the public representatives, the interests of the organizations some of them are influenced by, as well as the politicians that support the original text.\n\nThe Bill is now being processed as a matter of constitutional urgency and the fact it cannot be voted until next week prevents various other proposals from being voted too - such as the law that would allow anyone to publish biographies regardless of whether the subject allows it or not - so this process has to be out of the way soon.\n\nPoliticians and activists who have campaigned for provisions such as net neutrality wanted the Bill to be voted as soon as possible regardless of the agreement of the opposition and the telcos - however, ithe vote on the Marco Civil will only take place on November 5, when the leader of the initiative is due to present a final version of the Bill.\n\nThis weekend is set to be packed full of reports of secret dinners with politicians, media tycoons and telco bosses, petitions with several hundreds of thousands supporting the original proposal and protests against the interests of the large corporations. We just have to hope that on Tuesday, common sense will prevail and Brazil will not take yet another backwards step."},

Read the full text of the letter below, where Snowden attempts to ask the country for asylum for the second time.\n\n\"Six months ago, I stepped out from the shadows of the\u00a0United States\u00a0Government's National Security Agency to stand in front of a journalist's camera. I shared with the world evidence proving some governments are building a world-wide surveillance system to secretly track how we live, who we talk to, and what we say. I went in front of that camera with open eyes, knowing that the decision would cost me family and my home, and would risk my life. I was motivated by a belief that the citizens of the world deserve to understand the system in which they live.\n\nMy greatest fear was that no one would listen to my warning. Never have I been so glad to have been so wrong. The reaction in certain countries has been particularly inspiring to me, and\u00a0 Brazil\u00a0is certainly one of those.\n\nAt the\u00a0NSA, I witnessed with growing alarm the surveillance of whole populations without any suspicion of wrongdoing, and it threatens to become the greatest human rights challenge of our time. The NSA and other spying agencies tell us that for our own \"safety\" \u2014 for Dilma's \"safety,\" for Petrobras ' \"safety\" \u2014 they have revoked our right to privacy and broken into our lives. And they did it without asking the public in any country, even their own.\n\nToday, if you carry a cell phone in Sao Paolo, the NSA can and does keep track of your location: they do this 5 billion times a day to people around the world. When someone in Florianopolis visits a website, the NSA keeps a record of when it happened and what you did there. If a mother in Porto Alegre calls her son to wish him luck on his university exam, NSA can keep that call log for five years or more. They even keep track of who is having an affair or looking at pornography, in case they need to damage their target's reputation.\n\nAmerican Senators tell us that Brazil should not worry, because this is not \"surveillance,\" it's \"data collection.\" They say it is done to keep you safe. They're wrong. There is a huge difference between legal programs, legitimate spying, legitimate law enforcement \u2014 where individuals are targeted based on a reasonable, individualized suspicion \u2014 and these programs of dragnet mass surveillance that put entire populations under an all-seeing eye and save copies forever. These programs were never about terrorism: they're about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation. They're about power.\n\nMany Brazilian senators agree, and have asked for my assistance with their investigations of suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens. I have expressed my willingness to assist wherever appropriate and lawful, but unfortunately the United States government has worked very hard to limit my ability to do so -- going so far as to force down the Presidential Plane of Evo Morales to prevent me from travelling to Latin America! Until a country grants permanent political asylum, the US government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak.\n\nSix months ago, I revealed that the NSA wanted to listen to the whole world. Now, the whole world is listening back, and speaking out, too. And the NSA doesn't like what it's hearing. The culture of indiscriminate worldwide surveillance, exposed to public debates and real investigations on every continent, is collapsing. Only three weeks ago, Brazil led the United Nations Human Rights Committee to recognize for the first time in history that privacy does not stop where the digital network starts, and that the mass surveillance of innocents is a violation of human rights.\n\nThe tide has turned, and we can finally see a future where we can enjoy security without sacrificing our privacy. Our rights cannot be limited by a secret organization, and American officials should never decide the freedoms of Brazilian citizens. Even the defenders of mass surveillance, those who may not be persuaded that our surveillance technologies have dangerously outpaced democratic controls, now agree that in democracies, surveillance of the public must be debated by the public.\n\nMy act of conscience began with a statement: \"I don't want to live in a world where everything that I say, everything I do, everyone I talk to, every expression of creativity or love or friendship is recorded. That's not something I'm willing to support, it's not something I'm willing to build, and it's not something I'm willing to live under.\"\n\nDays later, I was told my government had made me stateless and wanted to imprison me. The price for my speech was my passport, but I would pay it again: I will not be the one to ignore criminality for the sake of political comfort. I would rather be without a state than without a voice.\n\nIf Brazil hears only one thing from me, let it be this: when all of us band together against injustices and in defence of privacy and basic human rights, we can defend ourselves from even the most powerful systems.\""},

That is because the payroll tax contributions that were supposed to come from corporates were coming from the treasury instead and going into workers' retirement funds.\n\nIntroduced in 2011, the breaks had the aim of making industry sectors affected by the global recession more competitive. At the time, the measures were well-received as it meant Brazil could increase its international footprint in the IT services industry.\n\nIT buyers dealing with Brazilian technology services providers are now waiting to see how their suppliers will manage this latest hurdle.\n\nAccording to Alexandro Strack, chief information officer at Gefco, a logistics subsidiary of the PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn group, nothing should change in current agreements, but the future of new IT outsourcing deals will depend on how suppliers will react to the news.\n\n\"In this difficult economic moment Brazil is going through, I can't see how they could adjust prices, so they will have to sacrifice their own profitability if they want to maintain their current clients and find new ones,\" Strack says.\n\nBrazilian companies could be a more attractive outsourcing destination than other cheaper locations worldwide due to its stable political conditions, costs that, although higher than India, are lower than the US, as well as a similar time zone to North America.\n\nBut the lack of legislative reforms needed to create a level playing field with other IT outsourcing powerhouses worldwide, as well as a focus on domestic politics, means progress has been slow.\n\n\"There are some IT services that have to be hired locally.

It's hard to satisfy international customers in conditions like these,\" Delai adds.\n\nPayroll tax relief for IT companies exporting services was central to the strategy carried out by Brasscom, the Brazilian association devoted to the development of the local ICT sector.

It is expected that this will result in cost reductions,\" the coordinator of the submarine cabling project at Telebras, Ronald Vallad\u00e3o, told Deutsche Welle Brazil, adding that the savings to consumers could reach as much as 15 percent.\n\nThere is currently one cable connecting Brazil to Europe, Atlantis II, which is old and has limited capacity, being almost exclusively used as a telephony link.\u00a0\u00a0The country has four other submarine cables, each connecting Brazil to the United States.\n\nThe new cable will link Portugal to the city of Fortaleza in the northeast of Brazil. The project was announced following reports that the National Security Agency in the United States had been spying on Brazil's telecommunications - the plan is to build links that would funnel internet traffic between South America and Europe, bypassing the US entirely.\n\nTelebras maintains that the motivation for building the undersea link is economic - with the added bonus of security - but stresses that the cable project would have gone ahead regardless of the revelations regarding the NSA spying revelations.\n\nThe state-owned telecoms firm had also announced a partnership with Angola to build another submarine fiber optic cable link between the two countries. The idea was that Brazil would serve as a relay point for a link that Angola Cable is building to reach the US via Brazil.\n\nBut Telebras released a note last week where it \"clarifies\" the point that \"the company's priority is the construction of the submarine cable linking Brazil to the European continent.\" The note added that the Brazilian government offered Angola Cables a landing point on Brazilian soil, also in the northeastern city of Fortaleza - meaning the Angolans would no longer have the Brazilian government as a financial partner for the project.\n\nThe original deal looked a little bit different. Back in March 2012, an agreement was signed between Telebr\u00e1s and Angola Cables that formalized the interest of both companies to work together to launch the fiber optic structure, which should have been ready in time for the World Cup. In fact, this would have been helpful given the concerns around the country's telecoms infrastructure ahead of the sporting events.\n\nAt the time, Telebr\u00e1s then president Caio Bonilha, who quit earlier this year, said an international tendering process would be launched by June 2012 detailing the project. This never happened, sparking controversy between Telebr\u00e1s executives and Angola Cables president Ant\u00f3nio Nunes, who was quoted extensively as criticizing the Brazilian government for giving up on the project.\n\nThe initial Telebr\u00e1s plan was to build five undersea cables to the US, Portugal, Uruguay, another Brazilian cable linking the north with key cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, as well as Angola. However, cash shortages meant that it was only possible to carry out a single project and the European link took priority."},

The minister told delegates at a public sector telecoms event that his team is currently working on a new plan to deliver quality broadband to the maximum amount of citizens at a lower cost and faster speeds.\n\nAccording to Berzoini, the intention is to \"create an environment where companies can invest larger sums of money and get medium and long-term paybacks.\" The new minister added that the government \"will invest a large amount, given the need to increase the country's telecom infrastructure.\" This was one of president Rousseff's pledges during her presidential campaign last October.\n\n\"We want to present something that the country will see as a real goal to be achieved within the next four years,\" the minister said. According to Berzoini, there are budgetary constraints, but the idea is to prioritize more strategic areas for improvement, without citing specifics.\n\nThe new Communications minister stressed that the new plan will maintain previous projects, such as the development of Brazil's first satellite - which aims to protect priviledged information that may impact on national security while boosting the broadband capacity of the country - and expand on original digital inclusion targets.\n\nBerzoini did not give an indication of what the new targets might be, but the Rousseff government has failed to meet its existing goals in terms of digital inclusion: official numbers indicate that 2014 ended with 23 million households connected to the Internet, well below the originally intended 35 million.\n\nWhen it comes to quality of services, Internet speed in Brazil generally lags behind rest of the world. According to a study carried out by Akamai last year, global average broadband speed has gone up by 21 percent in the second quarter of 2014, while average Internet speed in Brazil has gone up by 11 percent."},

Back when these products were launched, one dollar was worth about R$ 2,30 and now it has increased to almost R$2,70,\" says Rodrigues.\n\n\"So Apple prices for the imported items are unsurprisingly going up for retailers and final consumers - and that's also the case for other smartphone makers selling imported goods in Brazil,\" he adds.\n\n\"However, it is also worth observing that ever since Apple launched the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in Brazil, the items they have imported have flown off the shelves. So obviously there are Brazilians who are willing to spend a lot on a device.\"\n\nEven before the increase, Apple's prices in Brazil were already the highest in the world, followed by Turkey and Italy.

Until 2013, the year Big Data went mainstream, there was very little understanding about the concept of data analytics and its applications, the technologies behind it and the companies that operated in this space.\n\nWith growing interest in the topic and expanding media coverage, understanding grew and because of this, 2014 has been a year of widespread local experimentation, pilot projects and proofs of concept. Many of the largest companies experimented with the concepts and technologies, either internally or by hiring external help, and the demand has only been growing.\n\nHowever, just as with every other emerging technology, there is still a lot of uncertainty and confusion related both with the underlying concepts of Big Data and the potential applications and benefits that it can bring. Actually, many people still have a hard time agreeing on what exactly Big Data is.\n\nIn this environment of high demand coupled with uncertainty, some noteworthy trends have arisen and will be shaping the evolution of the market in 2015:\n\nNon-techies will help fix the skills gap\n\nTo realize all the potential of Big Data projects, it is not enough to have professionals that are skilled on the technical tools. To achieve results, they must also have a good understanding of maths and statistics, as well as deep business knowledge. This combination of skills is what characterizes a data scientist, or a data science team - and the demand for this kind of professionals has never been greater.\n\nThe lack of qualified professionals to work on Big Data projects in Brazil is one of the main problems companies face when starting analytics projects, and also the reason why consultants active within that field have no shortage of work these days.\n\nMany of the top universities in Brazil have been trying to address the Big Data skills gap by launching new executive or part-time courses focused on teaching the basics of data analysis, and updating their CVs accordingly. Many companies have also been investing in training in a more focused manner to better respond to these issues.\n\nOne very interesting trend here is that much of the Big Data-related training is being offered to professionals who do not have an IT background, but rather a statistics or math background.\n\nThis indicates that the market appears to have decided that it is more productive to teach those who already understand data analysis how to work with the tools they need to handle Big Data, than to teach data analysis to those who already understand the technical side.\n\nSo it is fair to say that there's a huge opportunity for companies focused on training and education to provide courses for the market. There is also a lot of space for companies to provide tools for handling Big Data that anyone, regardless of their tech proficiency, can use.\n\nJust as the advent of cloud computing brought about the \"cloud washers\" - companies that simply slapped the cloud computing label on whatever software or solutions they already had - today we are witnessing the rise of \"big data washers\" in Brazil: companies that are labelling their solutions \"Big Data\" regardless of whether they deliver on that promise or not.\n\nWhile this is a common trend for any emerging technology that hits the mainstream, it seems to be happening even more in the Big Data space in this market. Part of the problem is the confusion and uncertainty surrounding it.\n\nThe lack of consensus and definitions then enables companies to rebrand their products as so-called Big Data offerings without giving customers a clear way to differentiate between the serious companies and those that are less so.\n\nA lot of this relabeling also happens internally. Many companies, especially large corporations in the telecom and financial services verticals, have been claiming to have always worked with Big Data, that this is just a new name for the work they already did.\n\nIt is true that these companies might have been handling massive amounts of data for quite some time, but volume alone is not enough to label a dataset as Big Data.\n\nUnfortunately though, not everyone understands this difference.\n\nThis trend will definitely continue to be seen in Brazil over the next year, as the large interest of the market on Big Data creates an incentive for solution providers and IT shops to jump on the bandwagon. Growing understanding and wider dissemination of information may help reverse it, but here in Brazil there is still a long way to go.\n\nBig Data is already a huge market, accounting for several hundred million dollars of IT spending in Brazil alone. Today, most of this money is going to technology companies from outside Brazil (infrastructure or basic application providers, such as Amazon and Cloudera), or to large consulting firms who are implementing projects.\n\nThe local companies having the most success and experiencing faster growth in the Big Data market are those who sought a particular Big Data problem and developed a product that solves that problem in its entirety. Such companies handle data collection, analysis and processing themselves, delivering the final result of the process to clients, instead of a series of technologies that can be applied to that problem.\n\nWhy is that approach unique? Because it presents more valuable learnings to companies wanting to dabble with Big Data: finding a problem and focusing on solving it from start to finish means you are much more likely to succeed, rather than simply experimenting with tools and technologies applied to regular data.\n\nBig Data is still very much a nascent market in Brazil, and it is expected to grow tremendously over the next few years. 2015 will be a year where the first movers of the market will start to shift from proofs of concept to production-oriented projects. This will present an excellent opportunity for local and international companies, meaning that the data analytics market in Brazil is definitely one to watch this year.\n\nThoran Rodrigues is the founder of Brazil-based analytics specialist Big Data Corp and a former Tech Republic columnist."},

Using Google as an example, the minister was quoted as saying that the fact services provided in Brazil were often paid for with international cards made the tax collection for those services impossible.\n\nCiting Google Brazil's R$3.5bn on advertising revenue, Bernardo questioned whether tax had been paid on that amount. \"Is that money being taxed? The same taxes paid by traditional media? I don't believe it is,\" Bernardo told reporters at the MWC.\n\nThe minister added that there is a lack of transparency in how companies such as Google and Facebook operate and that the tax affairs of these companies should be investigated. In separate occasions, Bernardo also defended the taxation of services provided by companies such as Netflix.\n\nGoogle Brazil president Fabio Coelho then issued a response to the minister's claims last Friday (7), saying that the internet giant paid R$733m ($313m) in tax to the Brazilian government during 2013 and R$540 ($230m) in 2012. Coelho also added that Google Brazil's sales operations are invoiced locally and that any information is available to the Brazilian tax authorities.\u00a0 While Google was keen to make the point that it is tax-compliant in Brazil, this continues to be a grey area for many companies who sell services in the country. International companies \u2013 particularly those selling online services - such as Facebook often issue invoices from a country that is not where the service takes place. Corporate taxation is usually focused on profit rather than revenue so it is simple for global corporations to move profit and loss around to the most favorable locations. This has always been the case, but with digital products the question of where tax should be paid gets confusing. Whatsapp is the most popular messaging tool in Brazil, but even though millions of users are paying a dollar a year to use the system, where is the tax on those profits being paid? Probably in the United States, but the politicians would argue that it should be where the service is consumed. Taxation of anything is a constant political hot potato, and taxation of online commerce is no exception. And Brazil is also finally realizing just how important taxes are to its own revenues, as well as the value of data. But there is also an interest to continue to make it as easy as possible for online companies to grow, hire more people and stimulate the economy as a whole - and having senior government ministers making accusations publicly instead of figuring out a way to deal with this situation is probably not a great idea."},

The president briefly touched on the main topics in discussion at the event such as net neutrality, saying that \"user data should be inviolable.\"\n\nIn reference to government spying programs, the president made her \"indignation and repulse\" known once again: \"These events are not acceptable, were not acceptable in the past, and remain unacceptable today in that they are an affront to the free nature of the internet as an open, democratic platform,\" Rousseff said.\n\n\"We all want to protect the internet as a democratic space that's a shared asset for all of humankind,\" the Brazilian president added. \"We also want it to remain a strong economic force, providing that it continues to become more inclusive.\"\n\nThe president reinforced Brazil's preference for a multistakeholder model for Internet governance (including the government, private sector, civil society and related bodies) in balance with a multilateral approach in regard to the government influence in the process, \"so long as a country has no greater weight than another,\" - here, Dilma was reffering to the United States control of ICANN, the entity responsible for the management of IP numbers and addresses.\n\nRousseff's speech was preceded by Internet heavyweights and supporters of Brazil's campaign to secure a more democratic and decentralized web. Google's chief evangelist Vint Cerf praised CGI.br, the Brazilian Internet steering committee and originator of suggested principles for Web use and governance and also stressed that when the US contract ends with ICANN, a multistakeholder framework must be introduced.\n\nWorld Wide Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee said he was glad that the United States had decided to relinquish control of the Internet and that the decision was \"well overdue.\"\n\nThe influencers who made their way to Brazil to be part of the debate want concrete results. Vice President of the EU Commission leading its Digital Agenda policy Neelie Kroes said she will be \"breathing down everyone's neck\" until a discussion on concrete actions takes place.\n\n\"Those afraid of timelines for Internet governance reform need to remember that talking is not doing. [There is] no change without timelines,\" Kroes tweeted.\n\nThere has been a lot of skepticism about the ability of NetMundial to achieve anything concrete for the global community and that the agenda of the meeting is just rehashing previous similar events and a lot of time-wasting fluff.\n\nBut there is also a lot of momentum around it - the sanctioning of Brazil's own Internet Bill of Rights, Internet influencers supporting the initiative and the fact that this is all taking place as a response to the United States spying revelations\u2026send a very strong message to the world.\n\nWith an enforceable law regulating the net, Brazil\u2019s role as a host and promoter of NETmundial attracts more depth and interest to the discussion - as well as more authority to lead the global debate.\n\nThere are also some different circumstances and developments around this particular event: sure, it is Dilma Rousseff's government response to the NSA spying, but also, we are reaching a turning point in terms of internet governance.\n\nThe World Wide Web is now 25 years old and only now we seem to be seriously talking about governance, the actual principles, rights and guarantees of Internet users. As Berners-Lee pointed out during his speech yesterday, the technical work done on Internet was great, but it also widened the digital divide.\n\nThe internet is a global resource and so should be the way it is managed. If anything, NetMundial should be the start of conversations around the adoption of collaborative model for the management of the Internet, investment in domestic infrastructure and digital services to move away the current global power aggregation over our rights and freedoms online.\n\nHopefully, other countries will follow suit and start adopting their own \"Internet Constitutions.\" Now we'll just have to see if the practice will be just as excellent and exciting as the promise."},

However, when asked whether Brazil will be trying to get a consensus at NETmundial, Almeida said that \"there is no schedule\" for the matter to be resolved.\n\nInternet governance NETmundial will take place on April 23-24, with about 600 delegates from 85 countries expected to attend, representing the civil society, private sector and the government."},

However, sales to individuals recovered since the end of the World Cup and helped offset the impact seen in government projects.\n\nTotal revenue at Positivo for the third quarter reached R$ 534,3m ($210m), down 3.2 percent year on year.\n\nBack in September, analyst IDC predicted that PC sales in Brazil will see an overall drop of 24 percent in 2014 \u2014 the sharpest decline to date and a lot worse than the 10 percent decline it had previously predicted for the country in December last year."},

Operators Claro, Oi, Nextel, Tim and Vivo have partnered to deploy a single project with shared infrastructure and investment - the companies' equipment will live in a room with a fiber optic network linking towers distributed throughout the stadium to ensure coverage across the entire venue.\n\nThe total investment planned for for the indoor stadium coverage at all\u00a0the 12 World Cup venues is R$200m ($88.3m), according to SindTelebrasil. The association points out that this body of work was not part of the FIFA requirements or the obligations set out by Anatel, the Brazilian telecommunications agency.\n\nThe union adds that telcos also proposed the roll-out of free Wi-fi so that fans could rely less on the mobile network, but claims that of the 12 stadiums, only half have authorized the work so far.\n\nPaulo Bernardo, the communications minister, was keen to stress last week that the mobile and Wi-fi infrastructure is different to the set-up needed for the broadcasting of the events. The latter is a project led by government-owned telecommunications company Telebr\u00e1s, which includes the roll-out of fiber optic networks at all the venues.\n\nDespite ruling out the risk of a breakdown in the Telebr\u00e1s systems, Bernardo said that the public sector-led part of the project will be completed in a rush: venues such as the Arena da Baixada in Curitiba will only be completed by May 15 and only then the infrastructure will be rolled out.

The issue is that common citizens actually have no other option because of the lack of independent checks,\" says Unicamp professor and encryption specialist, Diego Aranha.\n\nAnother issue is that the Brazilian machines, which are based on the Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) model, do not produce a physical proof that the vote has been recorded. This means there is a constant danger of large-scale software fraud, as well as other non-technical tampering that could be perpetrated by former or current electoral justice staff and go totally undetected, according to Aranha.\n\nThe Brazilian Electoral Tribunal (TSE, in the Portuguese acronym) did not allow new public tests since the faults were discovered by Aranha's team in 2012, when the TSE granted access to more than 10 million lines of code for five hours. Since the system holes were found, the Tribunal said it would not allow further independent tests.\n\n\"[The TSE] said that my attitude was disrespectful and a threat to democracy, which is bizarre given that I am a professor at a public university,\" Aranha says.\n\n\"The reality is that there appears to be a conflict of interests, since the government wants to portray the system as bullet-proof and at the same time cover up these vulnerabilities,\" the academic adds.\n\nIn an attempt to introduce more transparency to the voting process in Brazil, Aranha then created a mobile app, Voc\u00ea Fiscal\u00a0(\"You Inspector,\" in Portuguese), that captures information from images sent by users of printed statements from the voting machines with the total vote counts, which are displayed publicly upon closing of the ballots.\n\nThe results produced from the information in the public's photos is then compared with the official results, creating an alternative version of the truth.\n\n\"If anything out of order has happened to the voting machine after the closing of the ballots, the system will detect it,\" the professor points out.\n\nThe Voc\u00ea Fiscal app has received over $30,000, more than double the amount of funding it originally sought on Brazilian crowdfunding website Catarse.\n\nThe professor's medium to long-term goal is to develop a prototype of a new electronic voting system that offers not only a printed proof that the vote has been processed, but also a more robust fraud detection system as well as auditing.\n\nThe Brazilian Electoral Justice system has made efforts to disseminate the electronic voting system, with trade missions to countries including Mozambique, South Africa and Guinea-Bissau, as well as Japan.\n\nAccording to the government, Peru, Bolivia, Haiti and Panama have requested technical information on the Brazilian electronic voting system, while the UK and US have made recent visits to learn more about the platform.\n\nProfessor Aranha, who has presented several times about the Brazilian e-voting system to international audiences, remains skeptical about its possible replication elsewhere.\n\n\"The government likes to promote our voting system as one of the most advanced in the world, mainly because we can get the results a lot faster than other countries using more traditional methods. However, speed is desirable, but not the most important feature of an e-voting platform,\" Aranha points out.\n\n\"And the TSE presents the international interest in the system in a way that is convenient to them. But the reality is that many countries have been here, the Brazilian government presents it all through rose-tinted glasses, but how many countries have actually adopted our system?\" he adds.\n\n\"These countries haven't done so because our system does not have appropriate transparency features that you would expect.\"\n\nThe TSE states that the electronic voting process has \"essential mechanisms to ensure voters' safety\" in place, such as digital signature.\n\nSecurity tests in the voting machines were not carried out ahead of this year's elections, but a security working group has been put together by the TSE to map requirements in that area and plan for a roadmap of e-voting security, counting and auditing in Brazil.\n\nHowever, the group's agenda is moving at a slow pace and has no specific deadline to deliver the recommendations."},

The NETmundial initiative channels this energy to offer practical solutions in Internet governance to solve immediate needs,\" says ICANN president Fadi Chehad\u00e9.\n\nThe platform has been described as a \"meeting point\", where stakeholders will be able to put ideas forward, discuss them and attract the support to make them reality if necessary. In that sense, the WEF support icomes in handy, given its reach within the business community.\n\nBut the initiative's \"caretakers\" CGI and ICANN, as well as supporter WEF, will not be responsible for any activities regarding the selection of financing of the projects and are keen to stress the collaborative nature of the initiative.

In addition, the CGI and ICANN will take two seats each, while the WEF and the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) will take up individual seats in the coordinating group for the initiative.\n\nDemi Getschko, board member at the CGI and chief executive at the Brazilian Network Information Center (NIC.br), highlighted that the individuals that, as well as the organizations that kickstarted the initiative, the Council will have no decision-making function other than ensuring that the platform functions properly.\n\n\"All Council members will also have to support and agree with the principles that came out of the NETmundial meeting in S\u00e3o Paulo earlier this year,\"\u00a0he told ZDNet.\n\nAccording to Getschko, the collaborative work within the Internet governance initiative will be carried out mostly online and there is no set agenda for meetings, online or in person.\n\nFor now, the only goals in terms of timescales are that the Council should be in place by year end and that some form of inaugural meeting will take place in January 2015 so the initiative can start its activities.\n\nThe NETmundial initiative follows a conference with the same name, organized by the Brazilian government and held in S\u00e3o Paulo in April, in the aftermath of the National Security Agency spying scandal that included Brazil as one of the non-adversarial countries being monitored by the United States.\n\nBack then, the Brazilian government said that the US government's plan to end its contractual oversight of ICANN over certain key aspects of Internet addressing and naming also made NETmundial \"even more timely.\"\n\nBut Dilma Rousseff's government stressed that it wasn't intending to seize control of the Internet - rather, it was advocating for a more globalized mechanism that would allow discussions around Internet governance to take place in a multistakeholder environment.\n\nLocal Internet steering group CGI was responsible for a manifesto document that described principles for Web use and governance and was ultimately used as a foundation for Brazil's Marco Civil da Internet (also known as the country's \"Internet Constitution\"),\u00a0 passed a day before the April event and guided many of the debates at the conference.\n\nSenior government representatives, academics, Internet heavyweights and supporters of Brazil's campaign to secure a more democratic and decentralized web all attended the S\u00e3o Paulo event, where two documents were produced collaboratively to set the initial agenda of the group and future governance goals.\n\nAccording to CGI's Getschko, while the documents are not a mandatory set of rules for supporting organizations and countries, they \"paint a picture of aspirations and commitments from the overwhelming majority of the international community to guide Internet governance from that point on.\"\n\nThe Internet pioneer adds that the fact these discussions started in Brazil and the steps the country has taken towards a multistakeholder model for Internet governance meant the country was an obvious leader for the NETmundial initiative, despite the fact that other nations were also involved in the original debate.\n\n\"Through CGI, Brazil is a good paradigm in that area and ended up serving as an inspiration for the process of horizontally integrating all sectors and also with regards to the meeting results, which generated a letter with fundamental principles that should guide future steps in Internet governance,\" Getschko says.\n\n\"So when it came to following up on all those discussions that NETmundial started, CGI was naturally approached to be part of this continuation and also make it happen,\" he adds."},

It gained prominence after the NSA spying scandal and became the center of a political minefield due to disagreement over several crucial points.\n\nThe provisions around net neutrality are a key reason why the Bill is considered a major victory for the civil society and activists alike.

The measure was intended to ensure the privacy of Internet users as well as government data following the news of NSA spying activity, which allegedly included monitoring of communications between President Dilma Rousseff and key aides.\n\nDue to the removal of the requirement for local storage, the project rapporteur Alessandro Molon stressed the need to \"strengthen\" another article of the Bill, which states that companies storing and managing data generated by Brazilians should comply with Brazilian law when it comes to privacy rights, data protection and secrecy of private communications regardless of where datacenters - and the data itself - are located.\n\nThe Marco Civil also preserves protection against intermediary responsibility, which means that Internet service providers will not be liable for any offensive content published by users - currently, Brazil has no specific rules on this and court decisions vary around whether companies or users should be penalized over offensive pages.\n\nAccording to the Bill, service providers will only be liable for damage caused by third parties if they don't comply with court orders requiring the removal of the offensive content. The purpose of the rule, according to the project's rapporteur Molon, is to strengthen freedom of expression on the web and avoid falling into what he defined as \"private censorship.\"\n\nThe Bill is still subject to changes by the Senate, but its supporters are confident that the Marco Civil might, after all, become law before NETmundial, the global conference on Internet governance that will take place in Brazil next month."},

People [in areas outside large urban areas] do not need [fiber] and do not want it. Fiber is about fixed internet access and people want mobility ,\" Levy told portal Converg\u00eancia Digital, adding that it makes more sense for countries with poorer infrastructure to focus on mobile access.\n\nThe view of the telcos is at odds with government intentions: during her recent campaign, reelected president Dilma Rousseff talked about her \"Internet for all\" plan of\u00a0connecting digitally excluded Brazilians by broadening the fiber optic infrastructure of the country.\n\nData from the Ministry of Communications suggests that about 42 percent of Brazilian municipalities still lack fiber optic infrastructure and president Rousseff has expressed her desire to cover most of those locations in her second mandate. But the Brazilian president has also conceded that telcos will not invest unless there is a legal requirement to do so - and the latest union declarations reinforce that fact.\n\nAccording to to Communications minister Paulo Bernardo, Rousseff has requested the Internet For All project is fleshed out ahead of the start of her new presidential term on January 1.\n\nThe president has \"a few options to choose from,\" according to the minister, but the overall idea is to create a government-sponsored program to promote the development of broadband provision with fiber networks, particularly amongst citizens of lower incomes\u00a0\u2014 the parcel of the population that, according to the telcos, does not want or need fast Internet.\n\n\"We can, and we need, to considerably expand our fiber optic networks,\" the minister told delegates at an awards ceremony last night.\n\nThe president is correct to imply that without a major policy shift to increase competition and investment in infrastructure, broadband provision in Brazil will continue to lag behind the rest of the world. But there is more groundwork to do.\n\nHyper-connected South Korea has shown the world how that's done: it provided incentives to computer manufacturers to make purchasing of computers possible by poorer people, while subsidizing the price of connections for that digitally excluded part of the population.\n\nIn addition, it invested in the actual infrastructure, a first step towards creating ways to encourage more companies to enter the market without having to make massive investments. This in turn led to more choices and cheaper services.\n\nAs it stands, the handful of companies that concentrate the provision of broadband services in Brazil are unlikely to let their monopolies slip away all that easily, or even agree to novelties such as open networks. So far, they have also been allowed to get away with it: only recently telcos have been forced to comply with minimum standards of services, which come at a premium.\n\nWhat Brazil needs is a clear-cut plan to become a connected country, so creating the environment and policies necessary to make high-speed connections accessible to a large parcel of the population. But the process of creation of Brazil's Internet governance rules has proven that getting the telcos to cooperate is far from easy.\n\nIn her second term, Rousseff will have to take responsibility for these improvements rather than leaving it all up to the private sector, make that plan a priority - and of course, execute on it."},

All apps will be available in Android, iOS and Windows Phone versions.\n\nThe first tool - and perhaps the most interesting of the three apps - was launched on Friday (18) and provides detailed information about the candidates. The elections to be held in October will not only elect the president, but also the national Congress, state governors and state legislatures and involve some 24,000 candidates across the country.\n\nThrough the TSE app, citizens are able to see the candidate's basic information such as full name, his or her party and any coalitions associated to it. The TSE website, however, has a section that displays more detailed data about the contenders such as declared assets and forecast campaign spending - but it is not linked to the app.\n\nA separate application will inform citizens about the voting process in Brazil, where voting is compulsory, such as wards and electoral divisions and will use geo positioning to inform the best route to get to the voting location. This app is not yet available.\n\nAnother tool, also yet to be released, will inform real-time results once the actual election starts. Since 1996, voting in Brazil uses compact, portable voting devices and a centralized process that is able to process even close elections within hours."},

In 2014, the initiative has expanded its remit to encompass new businesses from Brazil as well as China.\n\nStartups with ideas focused on the areas of technology, smart cities, communities, productivity, energy, mobility, innovation, sustainability and cleantech are the main areas of focus for the initiative.\n\nThe first stage of the program will see ideas screened by partner accelerators in S\u00e3o Paulo, Beijing and Lisbon. Out of the startups that attracted initial interest, 15 teams will then be picked by the Portuguese organizers.\n\nThe 15 winning teams will then be invited out to Lisbon to take part in acceleration bootcamps led by Portuguese incubator F\u00e1brica de Startups. All travel expenses will be covered by the program.\n\nFollowing the month-long acceleration program, the companies will then take part in a global pitch event with investors \u2014 and if successful, secure early-stage funding of up to \u20ac20,000 ($26,644).\n\nInterested teams worldwide can already apply for the program, which has different deadlines for submissions for different countries.

More than 200 staff went about their normal business as the villains loaded seven trucks with numerous items including notebooks, tablets and smartphones.\n\nAccording to the police, the criminals accessed the facility disguised as staff during the night shift, just after midnight. Some employees were held hostage by the criminals while the majority continued to work, but had the batteries of their mobile phones taken to prevent them from calling the police.\n\nThe gang was\u00a0not violent at any point and remained onsite for three hours, the Samsung employees told the police.\n\nThe robbery is now being investigated and the police added that the case could well be an inside job since the gang could not only access the factory but also had some privileged information about where certain valuable items were located.\n\n\"We are very concerned about this incident. Fortunately, nobody was hurt. We are fully cooperating with the ongoing police investigation, and we will do our best to avoid it happening again,\" Samsung said in a statement."},

A 7,5 percent pay increase was granted, along with daily meal subsidies of R$15 ($6,70).\n\nAdditionally, every IT company in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo will have to present profit share plans to their staff this year.\n\nSeprosp, the body representing the tech employers, had offered a 6.2 percent pay rise, daily meal subsidies of R$14 ($6,30) for companies that employ more than 50 staff and profit sharing plans for companies with more than 30 employees.\n\nAt the time, Seprosp president Luigi Nese told ZDNet some of the workers' demands were \"hard to meet.\"\n\nAll the updated conditions will be backdated to January 1. Employers will also be forced to pay staff for the day of the strike, February 21. The stability of striking employees - which is something employers union Seprosp was trying to prevent - was maintained.\n\nSince the strike of S\u00e3o Paulo techies took place in February, the Ministry of Labor requested the temporary suspension of the action until a ruling established a common ground between staff and employers. Between the strike suspension and the final court decision this week, over 500 agreements took place between the workers union and technology companies to secure the terms that are now valid for all firms in the state.\n\n\"With over 500 agreements signed [between the workers union and companies] we managed to prove that the employers union was wrong when it said that IT companies could not afford better salaries and benefits for their employees,\" says the president of Sindpd, the body representing the professionals, Antonio Neto."},
