The social network is trying to eat the Internet to keep you from ever leaving. Meanwhile, businesses know it\u2019s tough to persuade you to interrupt your social experience by opening one of their ads.\n\nToday Facebook rolled out Instant Articles to all iOS users and launched an Android beta. But news publishers aren\u2019t the only ones Facebook wants to load inside, rather than outside, its app.\n\nAt first Facebook called them \u201cImmersive ads\u201d and then the \u201cads canvas\u201d, but really, they\u2019re the paid promotional equivalent to its hosted organic initiative Instant Articles. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling them Instant Ads.\n\nEssentially, Instant Ads are in-feed Facebook mobile ads that when tapped, immediately unfold a rich media marketing experience within Facebook\u2019s app rather than forcing people to wait for a mobile browser page to load. Inside, these Instant Ads can sport animations, carousels, product catalogs, and tilt-to-view images. These data-heavy features might normally take so long to load in a browser that people would \u2018x\u2019 out before they appeared.\n\nThe same rhetoric behind Instant Articles makes even more sense when what the user is waiting for is a paid ad rather than organic content from The New York Times or National Geographic. Instead of\u00a0penalizing users for opening ads by interrupting their social experience with a slow-loading mobile website, Facebook\u00a0pre-caches the marketer\u2019s content so it appears immediately when users tap. That allows advertisers to include more engaging multimedia content that actually holds people\u2019s attention.\n\nFor example, an Instant Ad I recently spotted from fast-food chain Wendy\u2019s unfolded to\u00a0reveal a bevy of rich media related to its burger. I could tilt my phone to scan across its mayo-laced bun, swipe through photos of onions and pickles, and watch an animation of someone drawing with ketchup.\n\nIt might sound silly, but it makes you feel like you\u2019re actually holding a Wendy\u2019s burger. That\u2019s quality institutional brand advertising, and it never required me to leave Facebook. The brand lift already happened. Only if I want to use a store locator would I need to click a link at the end of the Instant Ad to visit Wendy\u2019s site. In that way, Instant Ads aren\u2019t unlike tv commercials. They\u2019re so vivid that you just need to watch for them to be effective.\n\nFacebook hasn\u2019t been too flashy heralding Instant Ads. It unscooped the press by quietly telling a few outlets about them in September, but never published its own announcement. Last week it briefly mentioned them in a broader blog post about shopping features. But they\u2019re a much bigger deal than that.\n\nInstant Ads epitomize Facebook\u2019s ad strategy, which is\u00a0about making the result of online marketing some kind action taken or emotional impact, rather than a short-lived click to a website.\n\nFacebook now has Buy buttons that let you purchase products you see within feed ads with your credit card on file so you never visit a merchant\u2019s site. Its newest ads offer sign-up forms that are great for lead generation and plug right into a business\u2019 CRM like Salesforce.\n\nFor the user, it\u2019s a bit like being put in a pinball machine. Facebook earns points as long as you\u2019re still rattling around inside, running into friends\u2019 photos, native videos, and Instant Articles.\u00a0Facebook loses when you slip out of its app through the few remaining holes. And\u00a0Instant Ads are like an extra set of flippers, bumping you back inside when you were about to leave.\n\nSometimes that means you don\u2019t spend your quarters anywhere else. Instant Articles pose a serious risk to news and content publishers who lose the relationship with their audience that leads to loyal readership and subscriptions.\n\nBut for the user, a Facebook where you can see friends, read news, watch videos, and even experience ads without enduring crappy mobile load times sounds like more fun. Play on, Zuck.\n\nFor more on Facebook\u2019s strategy, check out our gallery \u201c20 GIFs And Photos Of How Facebook Is Eating The Internet\u201d", "author": "Josh Constine", "date": "2015-10-20 10:30:46"},

It\u2019s like \u2018What\u2019s he doing\u2019?\u201d He also said the advice to stay private as long as possible was the \u201cworst advice ever given in Silicon Valley.\u201d\n\nHis advice to those in the early-stage startups centered around staying low during this frothy economic period. \u201cJust don\u2019t rush yourself up to 50 people or something\u2026focus on your product, your customer, on being nimble and you\u2019ll probably ride through all of this,\u201d Gurley said.\n\nHowever, Gurley also dodged questions about the giant co-working startup WeWork, of which\u00a0Benchmark is an investor. The startup, if you can call a decacorn that, has added more than $1 billion to its coffers \u2013 its $355 million Series D round came from several late-stage heavyweights like T. Rowe Price, Goldman Sachs and Wellington Managment.\n\nWhen asked if WeWork was overvalued, Gurley told Journal reporter Rolfe Winkler, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d Then added, \u201cHave you been to one of them?\u201d\n\nGurley went back to his usual economic forecasting for most of the discussion, adding, \u201cSilicon Valley has entered a period that is speculative and unsustainable,\u201d and \u201cI personally wish the market would bring them all down so we can get to more realistic valuations.\u201d\n\nGurley does not hold back his frank opinion: Companies shouldn\u2019t wait to IPO, too many overvalued, liquid is the goal, etc. And the Benchmark general partner mostly stuck to his typical inflated valuations and bubble warning drumbeat during the interview, but also added that this was a good time for those of us using these private startup services.\n\n\u201cThe VC community\u2019s been subsidizing the biggest consumer surplus in history.

The company\u2019s music streaming app just moved into the No. 1 position on the iPhone App Store\u2019s \u201cTop Grossing\u201d charts for the first time in the U.S.\n\nPreviously, according to data from App Annie, the highest rank Spotify saw on\u00a0the \u201cTop Grossing\u201d charts stateside was No. 3., which it hit earlier this year and maintained in September. It fared better in other markets, however \u2013 for example, in Spotify became the No. 1 Top Grossing app in the U.K. that same month.\n\nThis slight bump could be due to a number of factors, including the launch of the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus devices, which could also be boosting downloads, and subsequently, conversions within\u00a0popular mobile applications like Spotify. And it\u00a0could just be benefitting from the rollout of Apple Music, which helped to introduce the idea of on-demand streaming to a wider audience of iPhone owners, who may have then compared the other options on the market and decided to shift their subscriptions over to Spotify.\n\nAnd, of course, the timing of the bump is also notable as it comes following the end of the Apple Music free trial. For those who signed up with Apple Music as soon as it became available, their trial period wrapped up at the end of last month. (Apple\u2019s\u00a0service, which doesn\u2019t have a free tier like Spotify, Pandora and others, instead let users try it out for free for three months, before having to pay the $9.99 monthly fee.)\n\nA month after the service launched, Apple said it had 11 million trial members.\n\nHowever,\u00a0as\u00a0Cook\u2019s remarks suggested, Apple apparently lost millions of Apple Music users when the free trial period ended \u2013 around 40 percent of its user base. That\u2019s actually a decent conversion rate for a new service, but the lift in Spotify\u2019s Top Grossing ranking indicates that possibly\u00a0some of those early Apple Music users\u00a0are now testing out a different service instead.\n\nBut\u00a0time will tell how many of those 6.5 million Apple Music paying members are \u201caccidentally\u201d paying for the service \u2013 meaning, they forgot to cancel their subscription and won\u2019t realize it\u00a0until later when they see a bill or bank statement.\n\nFor comparison\u2019s sake, Apple Music has 15 million total users, including those on free trials and paying customers, but Spotify has 20 million paying users\u00a0out of over 75 million active users, according the most recent public data from the company, released back in May.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that other music streaming apps, including Pandora, SoundCloud, Rhapsody and Rdio, saw their rankings, including grossing rank, staying fairly consistent in the days since the Apple Music trial period ended. Pandora, for example, is today the No. 4 Top Grossing app on iTunes, which is not a big change from where it was in September (at No. 5, most of the time).\n\nIn App Annie\u2019s August index, Spotify was No. 7 in the U.S. for revenue, for iOS and Android combined. For iOS only, it was No. 4 for revenue. With Apple Music subscriptions kicking in (and with some users abandoning the service), it will be interesting to see how those ranks change going forward.\n\n\u201cBased on our app usage data, being part of the Apple \u2013 or Google or Facebook \u2013 app ecosystem is not a guarantee to be a smash hit. There are going to be some headwinds in terms of getting a read on Apple Music\u2019s success with this initial 3-month free trial,\u201d said\u00a0Danielle Levitas, SVP of Research & MarCom for App Annie, earlier this month. \u201cNow that subscriptions will start being paid through the app we should see it on the revenue charts going forward.\u201d\n\nBut for Spotify, it may be a case of a \u201crising tide lifts all boats.\u201d That is \u2013 Apple Music may not steal Spotify\u2019s paying subscribers, but rather bring it more exposure.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot of opportunity to expand the market,\u201d Levitas added. \u201cPandora had a first mover advantage and even though other services have emerged in recent years \u2013 e.g., Spotify \u2013 Pandora still holds a leading share of the market. We believe that Apple\u2019s music service is more likely to expand the music services market vs primarily cannibalizing existing subscribers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have access to millions of people that own an Apple device, many of those consumers have yet to subscribe to a music service.\u201d\n\nSpotify has flirted with the number one Top Grossing rank before. Earlier in October, it held the spot for a few hours, but not for a sustained period of time that would allow the move to register on third-party analytics services like App Annie.\u00a0It remains to be seen how long Spotify\u00a0can hold on to today\u2019s #1 Top Grossing spot, though.", "author": "Sarah Perez", "date": "2015-10-20 10:01:33"},

Diab\u2019s gut had twisted up on itself and he had to get treated or risk death. Just as Diab was struggling to regain his health, his insurance decided it didn\u2019t need to pay.\n\nThus, Collective Health was born\u00a0as a way to cut out health insurance and instead offer employers a way to pick and choose which things they want covered for their employees in what the startup hopes to make a less expensive and more efficient process.\n\nThe new funding\u00a0is going to several priorities across our business, according to Collective Health. Part of that is hiring more people. The startup said it expects to double in size in the next\u00a0few years and has already done so since the last round.\n\nPart of the money will also fuel expansion.

It\u2019s a well-designed stand that looks great with your Apple Watch.\n\nThe shiny new stand is everything you would expect \u2014 it\u2019s an expensive, beautiful stand. If you care about beautiful things like the Apple Watch, you might want to get one. After all, you may have just spent more than $1,000 to get an Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s.\n\nIt all starts with the box. Instead of a cheap cardboard box, the Fort\u00e9 comes in a solid box with a ribbon and a cushion. It shares the design vocabulary of high-end watchmakers with a watch-like box. And it doesn\u2019t just look like a premium item, it feels like one as well.\n\nYou untie the ribbon and take the stand out of the box. It\u2019s a heavy single piece of metal and leather. You can be sure that it won\u2019t break. At $59, I didn\u2019t expect anything less from Twelve South.\n\nThe Fort\u00e9 doesn\u2019t come with an Apple Watch cable. Like other stands, you need to provide your own cable.\n\nThe end of the cable fits right in the middle. You put a small metal-looking polycarbonate ring on top of it to make it look better, and also to prevent any possible contact with the metal body. Over the past few days, I haven\u2019t had any issue with the dock. It charges the watch as expected and is supposed to work with any model.\n\nThere are two things to like about the Fort\u00e9. First, it doesn\u2019t move at all. Weighing 0.77 pounds (351 g), it\u2019s more than your average Apple Watch stand. Compared to the somewhat similar looking Mophie stand, it doesn\u2019t tilt when you remove the Watch from the magnetic charger.\n\nSecond, you can also use the Watch in nightstand mode by rotating the Watch. I don\u2019t think it looks as good, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a way to make a nightstand mode dock look good. I will also probably need to buy another Apple Watch cable as I don\u2019t want to have to remove it and put it back in the stand every time I travel.\n\nThe black leather square is top-grain leather with a sanded surface. I understand why the company used top-grain leather as it\u2019s much easier to put a thin layer of leather on such an object with this kind of leather \u2014 it\u2019s much more versatile. It feels good although I would have loved a bit of grain but the sanded treatment doesn\u2019t allow that.\n\nI\u2019m quite impressed with the overall look of the stand. Sure it can be expensive, but nobody is forcing you to buy one if you\u2019re perfectly satisfied with your cable. Nobody even forces you to buy an Apple Watch. But if you\u2019re into good-looking things, the Fort\u00e9 could be something for you.", "author": "Romain Dillet", "date": "2015-10-20 09:59:42"},

Meanwhile,\u00a0one in 10\u00a0people under the age of 18 went through a period of major depression in 2014. Despite the prevalence of mental health issues among both children and adults in the U.S., less than 20 percent of children and 44 percent of adults get treated.\n\nLantern, a mental health startup that has raised $4.4 million, aims to provide an accessible and more affordable option, and it just launched a new program for stress. In addition to stress, Lantern offers programs for anxiety and body image.\u00a0When you first sign up for Lantern, you\u2019ll take an assessment that will determine which of its three tracks is best for you. All\u00a0of Lantern\u2019s programs are based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, which examines the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviors.\n\nThe programs, which are available on web and iOS, are designed to empower people to learn how to manage their anxiety, stress and/or body images on a daily basis. Lantern coaches, who are experienced behavioral change professionals trained in CBT, guide patients\u00a0through the programs, give them feedback and help keep them accountable for reaching their goals.\n\nLantern offers a seven-day, no-commitment, free trial. After that, it costs $49 a month, which is a lot less than what I pay for therapy. Over the last three weeks, I was able to try out Lantern\u2019s stress program. I\u2019d like to say I walked away feeling totally free of stress, but that wouldn\u2019t be true \u2014 partly, and most likely, because I didn\u2019t finish the full program.\u00a0The program typically takes about eight to 10\u00a0weeks to complete, depending on how often you do your daily sessions. Lantern also recommends having at least one phone call with your coach shortly after you start the program, but the thought of doing that caused stress for me \u2014 it just felt like another thing to do \u2014so I never got around to scheduling a call with my coach. That being said, I did take advantage of the unlimited messaging with her via Lantern\u2019s web app.\n\nDuring my two-week trial, I completed 1.5 units out of 14.\u00a0The program starts with \u201cIntroduction to Stress,\u201d which covers topics like stress cue and the science of breathing, as well as techniques like muscle relaxation and deep breathing. The other units cover mindfulness, reducing stress behaviors, managing emotions, automatic thoughts and more.\n\nIn the next year, Lantern hopes to offer additional programs around interpersonal relationships and mood disorders like depression. It also plans to sign on several more enterprise clients, like universities and employers, in the next three months.\n\n\u201cGiven what we are seeing from employers and insurers, more entities are focusing more on the established connection between our physical and mental health,\u201d Lantern Founder Alejandro Foung told TechCrunch. \u201cI think in a year, it will start to become more commonplace for insurers and employers to offer holistic benefits because we can demonstrate that people who are emotionally better off and more resilient actually are healthier physically.\u201d", "author": "Megan Rose Dickey", "date": "2015-10-20 09:30:45"},

Users can also book appointments via the platform (the booking piece is not a fully automated technology solution at this stage \u2014 rather Amino is bridging any tech gaps by getting on the phone itself to specific healthcare providers, where\u00a0necessary. But it\u2019s clearly betting\u00a0on all-digital appointment-booking\u00a0coming down the line in future to salve any\u00a0scalability challenges with that aspect\u00a0of its business).\n\nCo-founder and CEO David Vivero is\u00a0a former VP at Zillow, who also co-founded\u00a0real-estate startup RentJuice back in 2009, which was\u00a0acquired by Zillow for $40 million in\u00a02012.\u00a0He\u00a0says the aim with Amino is to offer a data-driven\u00a0alternative to people asking friends and family for healthcare recommendations, or finding recommendations via their insurance company websites \u2014 or indeed resorting\u00a0to a Google search to try to\u00a0track down a relevant doctor.\n\n\u201cThe biggest share of how people do this is they ask friends and family and then they go on a phone tag experience, trying to figure out which doctors accept their insurance. And whether they\u2019re available or not. So if we think about what we replace, we typically replace that activity\u2026 The next largest category, obviously, is people going to their insurance company websites,\u201d Vivero tells TechCrunch.\n\n\u201cOr basically Googling. Five billion searches a month are healthcare related. And what\u2019s problematic about that experience is you really get undifferentiated lists that are not personalized, that are not comprehensive, that are full of advertising, and so we think we really provide the best of asking a friend or family member because of how unbiased and data-driven it is, but also the convenience of being able to do this from your mobile phone.\u201d\n\nThe idea for the product came after he left Zillow and was looking for individual health insurance for\u00a0himself. Vivero\u00a0has a hereditary health condition that \u2014 back in 2013 \u2014 meant he was denied health insurance.\u00a0\u201cThat was awful and I did find health insurance eventually \u2014 I had to change my doctor. And every step of the way I felt, for someone who was relatively experienced in using all sorts of tools to feel good about the decisions I was making, I was shocked at the state of the art in being a healthcare consumer on my own.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I decided to really call up some folks in user experience and design \u2014 really the people that had helped me build my first product at RentJuice \u2014 and we set out to solve this. I\u2019d learned a lot when I was at Zillow about how important information is in freeing people up to make decisions and to feel good about their decisions.\u201d\n\nThe increase in rates of electronic healthcare record penetration in the U.S. is one\u00a0underlying driving factor making launching a data-driven consumer healthcare search platform possible at this point, according to\u00a0Vivero. He also points to\u00a0changes such as the Affordable Healthcare Act\u00a0putting U.S. consumers more \u201cin the driving seat\u201d when it comes to making decisions about their healthcare. Tech-enabled big data processing is a third factor.\n\nOn the latter front, one\u00a0key feature of the platform he\u00a0flags up is something Amino calls\u00a0\u201cdecision factors\u201d \u2014 which refers to additional \u201cpatient-centric\u201d search parameters\u00a0that let users narrow\u00a0results for specific types of\u00a0searches based on additional personal\u00a0preferences \u2014 and based on the platform performing risk adjusted\u00a0analysis of healthcare\u00a0data\u00a0\u2014 so that,\u00a0for instance, a female user\u00a0who is pregnant can\u00a0locate a doctor who has a low recent rate of C-section deliveries if\u00a0she\u00a0prefers to have a natural birth.\n\nVivero says Amino will be developing more of these decision factors to\u00a0let users narrow results in ways that make sense for them \u2014\u00a0based on the\u00a0feedback it gets from users.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be incredibly patient-centric in how we create the decision factors that go on Amino, but they\u2019re incredibly personalized\u2026 We really want to make people feel like we\u2019re listening to their needs \u2014 that we\u2019re giving them answers that they never had before, and that it\u2019s driven by data,\u201d he adds.\n\nAmino supports searches pertaining to\u00a0around 900 different medical conditions at this stage. The platform is a web app, so there\u2019s no need to download an app\u00a0to use it. The website also does not require users register before they can perform searches, although if you do want to book a doctor via the platform it will obviously ask for some data at that point (it also asks for some data to help hone search results to your requirements and the specifics of your condition \u2014 such as your age and gender). And it\u2019s free to use at this point.\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s currently no monetization structure in place, with doctors also being freely listed. Idea being, says Vivero, is it wants to present relevant, impartial data to help consumers make the best healthcare choices themselves \u2014 which means\u00a0no paid listings, and no ads either.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited to learn how people use our product. And in improving that product and adding additional services we may learn that there are great things that people are willing to pay for, but our current product is free \u2014 the information that we provide is free, it\u2019s national. And our approach will be to design a business model that enhances the consumer experience, rather than taxes it as an advertising model, for example, I believe would,\u201d he says.\n\nOne future monetization route might be around licensing data to people who make decisions in the healthcare system. \u201cIf you\u2019re a health insurance carrier or if you are a self-insured employer or you are a health IT company that would benefit by knowing a bit more about the C-section rates of physicians or the ability for people with a hernia to get out-patient care, and other questions like that, that may affect the cost and quality of care, then people have been interested in actually licensing some of the results from Amino.\u201d\n\nSo where exactly does Amino get its data? It\u2019s been building that up via partnerships since work started on the business\u00a0back in late 2013, according to\u00a0Vivero. \u201cWe\u2019ve accumulated this data over the course of many months, and now into years.\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been accumulated through a series of partnerships and investment, in both public and private partnerships. It\u2019s primarily insurance claims data \u2014 so what\u2019s great about insurance claims is that they are highly digital.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is we take the health insurance claims data, that can come from a whole host of different parts of the healthcare system, and we work with those third parties to ensure that we maintain patient privacy. So all of our sources of data work with us to de-identify all the data \u2014 so that the 188 million people inside of the database are anonymous.\u201d\n\nAs well as pulling\u00a0together a very large database of healthcare transaction information (comprising more than 3.9 billion data-points at this point, and apparently accounting for \u201cnearly every practicing doctor in American\u201d), data\u00a0which he describes as \u201chighly structured and overly specific\u201d in terms of the core needs of healthcare consumers, Amino\u2019s special sauce involves processing this data\u00a0to create patterns and clusters so it can\u00a0personalize results for individual users. For each search, it presents the user with\u00a0a match score per potential physician, based on their search parameters.\n\n\u201cPart of our investment\u2026 has just been trying to make this useable, trying to make this easy for people,\u201d adds\u00a0Vivero. \u201cIf we were just to publish health insurance claims data it would not be in any way a useful product for anyone. Instead what we\u2019ve had to do is try to figure out, using machine learning, biostatistics, and other forms of data science methods to actually infer what\u2019s happening inside of the doctor\u2019s office by grouping a lot of these [healthcare transaction] codes, and clustering them and doing a lot of work to actually draw insight from them.\n\n\u201cThe benefit is that the data is highly specific. So that means that we can really slice and dice some of these experiences so that people get a very personalized view. The challenge with that is if you were to publish the data in its raw form it wouldn\u2019t be useable to all of us \u2014 and part of what Amino sets out to do is try to make this thing extremely easy for someone to make a competent decision, which means actually creating a nice layer in between the data and the product.\u201d\n\nAmino is backed by $19.4 million in pre-launch financing at this point, taking in what Vivero says was \u201ca very quiet Series A\u201d from Accel in mid-2014, as it worked on building out its\u00a0data and the supportive analytics atop that, as well as testing the product and surveying consumers to shape a go-to-market strategy;\u00a0followed \u201crecently\u201d by $13 million from Charles River Ventures. Rock Health and more than a dozen individual investors have also contributed to its coffers at this stage.\n\nIt has also formed an advisory board comprised of individuals from academic, healthcare, privacy and consumer tech fields in order to \u2014 in its own words \u2014 \u201censure its approach, data methods, and services incorporate best practices\u201d.\n\nCurrent members of Amino\u2019s\u00a0board include: Dr. Ashish Jha (Faculty Director, Harvard Global Health\u00a0Institute), Udi Manber (National Institutes of Health, and former VP of Engineering at Google), Dr. Arnold\u00a0Milstein (Professor of Medicine and Director of the Stanford Clinical Excellence Research Center, Stanford\u00a0University), Dr. Philip Pizzo (Professor and former Dean, Stanford School of Medicine), Joy Pritts (Former\u00a0Chief Privacy Officer, Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, US Dept. of\u00a0Health and Human Services), Bryan Sivak (Former Chief Technology Officer, U.S. Dept. of Health and\u00a0Human Services), and Dr. Robert Wachter (Professor and Associate Chairman of the Department of\u00a0Medicine, and Chief of the Division of Hospital Medicine and Chief of the Medical Service at UCSF Medical\u00a0Center).", "author": "Natasha Lomas", "date": "2015-10-20 09:00:54"},

The company has been acquired by TriPlay, a startup based out of Israel and NYC that\u00a0operates various online\u00a0media services, including\u00a0MyMusicCloud.\u00a0Terms of the deal have not been disclosed but we understand from sources that the deal is under $26 million \u2014 not too far off, but less than, the last publicly-disclosed\u00a0price when eMusic was acquired by\u00a0Vivendi in 2001.\n\nThe companies say that the deal\u00a0was a mix of cash and\u00a0stock, with eMusic employees and services both coming over in the deal.\n\neMusic has been around since 1998, and it was once one of the more popular digital music sites around.\n\nBut a combination of forces worked against the company. The\u00a0basic economics of music downloads mixed with eMusic\u2019s all-you-can-eat business model; the domination of Apple\u2019s iTunes in the world of downloads; and the gradual rise of streaming services like Spotify that proved to be way more popular were all challenges for eMusic.\n\nAll of this translated to a carousel of management and ownership situations for the company. eMusic, which listed on NASDAQ in 1999\u00a0in the first dot-com boom, was the first online\u00a0music company to go public. It was then\u00a0acquired by Vivendi in 2001 for $26 million\u00a0(part of Vivendi\u2019s digital music landgrab that also included buying MP3.com for $372 million) after its stock tanked.\n\nIt was then sold two years later to the\u00a0investment group Dimensional Associates for an undisclosed amount. In 2013 it\u00a0eventually merged\u00a0with a digital books company, K-NFB, founded by the futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil (who is now at Google working on machine learning and language processing).\n\nAs for the\u00a0fate of\u00a0Media Arc, as the combined music/digital books company was called: a spokesperson confirmed that eMusic has been \u201cextracted\u201d from Media Art and K-NFB remains a separate company that is not part of the deal.\n\nThese days, eMusic offers a sliding scale of pricing plans for tiered numbers of downloads. It also has a free \u201cdiscovery\u201d service to lure in the punters. TriPlay\u2019s MyMusicCloud works on two tiers: a free tier which has unlimited free storage, and the ability to sync and play up to 250 tracks on five devices, with ads. A tier that costs $40/month\u00a0has unlimited free storage, unlimited syncing and playing of tracks on 10 devices and no ads.\n\nTriPlay says that the deal will make it \u201cone of the largest, most comprehensive digital music services in the world, comparable only to Apple iTunes and Amazon with a broad offering of features including its own music store, music player and accessibility on over 14 platforms via the web and apps.\u201d TriPlay says that it will now have a catalog of 25 million tracks and a user base of \u201cmillions\u201d of users (no specific number disclosed).\n\nWhile eMusic will stay\u00a0true to its download roots, TriPlay will now be offering its users the ability to match up those songs with tracks in the cloud to access them across multiple devices \u2014 breaking down one of the limitations of the download model.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether that mix will be enough to compete with the biggest players in the world, especially considering Apple\u2019s entry into the combined download/streaming space; and the fact that Spotify \u2014 currently\u00a0the highest grossing app on the App Store \u2014 and its various rivals (including Deezer, about to go public) have managed to convince a very large swathe of music consumers that download-free streaming\u00a0is the way forward.\n\nWhat TriPlay seems to be banking on the idea of tapping into more eclectic tastes and the long tail of music, playing on eMusic\u2019s own move last year away from mainstream music in favor of independent labels.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to join forces with this pioneer of the digital music industry to offer all our users the wide variety of music they love in a comprehensive, next-generation platform, complete with the features they want and need,\u201d said Tamir Koch, founder and CEO of TriPlay, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more music in the world than what you find on the radio.

Clad in white plastic and covered in grills, the case is far bigger than anything else in your kitchen and makes a noise like Darth Vader taking a nap. It takes two hours to prime and then, in a minute or so, can produce a glass of fizzy beverage without CO2 canisters, syrup bags, or any of the accoutrement associated with soda fountains. On the surface it\u2019s a modern miracle: a machine that makes soda (or pop) out of water and plastic. Then, when you think about it, it\u2019s kind of pointless.\n\nKeurig and Coke teamed up to make the Kold in an effort to win back the kasual soft drink drinker. They are using something called Karbonator pellets \u2013 do you see the klever thread here? \u2013 that produce CO2 when exposed to water. The kompany says that these pellets should not be eaten which makes me kontemplate what would happen if I accidentally necked one. Would it be katastrophic? That said, there is little opportunity for the pellets to fall into your drink simply because the little pods are self-kontained.\n\nTo use it you first run the machine for about two hours to prime the chiller. Then you pour water into the main tank and peel a little aluminum cover off of one of the pods. The pods make one drink in about 90 seconds. In that time I suspect the average cola drinker can down a half a can. Then you recycle the pod and, depending on your taste, drink the drink or pour it out in disgust. You, too, can experience the environmental guilt associated with the traditional pod coffee system, but in cola form!\n\nAt $359 for the machine and about $1.25 per drink I\u2019d be hard-pressed to recommend this kit to anyone at this point. The drinks, which came out cold, are slighty flat and the flavors are limited to Coke products and a few Keuring inspired soft drinks like \u201cartisanal\u201d birch beer and energy drinks. If you value your counter space the Kold isn\u2019t for you either simply because it takes up a 20\u00d712 square of space and weighs 23 pounds. In short, the Kold isn\u2019t for anyone in a city.\n\nSo the kuestion remains: why does this thing exist?\n\nI can see some of the use cases. Because this requires no CO2 canister you can simply place the machine in a break room and offer your co-workers frosty beverages on the fly. This could be cheaper than, say, one of those monolithic drink makers that are now popular. But the pods, priced at $5 for 4, are wildly expensive in comparison to a bottle of 99 sugar water you can get at the bodega. But having the ability store a few hundred of these in the space it takes to store a few cases of Coke could be compelling. Perhaps astronauts could take this into space and enjoy fine frosty beverages as they fight off the Zorgan menace? I believe, however, if you drink enough cola to warrant this machine you should probably just head out to Kostco and pick up a pallet of drinks. This think would satisfy your kravings.\n\nThe Keurig Kold is a fascinating idea. However, in practice it is too expensive and the drinks too underwhelming to replace a soda fountain system. Again, there may be a strange situation in which this makes more sense than simply buying a 2 liter bottle of old Dr. Rottenteeth\u2019s Fat Juice and maybe it\u2019s that rare person that Coke and Keurig are trying to grab. After all, cola konsumption is falling and, like Crystal Pepsi and New Coke before it, the manufacturers are trying hard to please konsumers. If the system were a little cheaper, the drinks a little better, and the entire experience not an insult to the environment I could imagine this as a fascinating if overzealous solution to the cola problem. As it stands, however, there is no cola problem and this kit, as ingenious as it is, is rather krappy.", "author": "John Biggs", "date": "2015-10-20 08:13:47"},

The Libratone Zipp features a brand new, rounder design with the same swappable cloth material. It has the same 360-degree structure to make the speaker sounds good from any side. With 100 watts of sound power, this speaker is more powerful than its previous iteration.\n\nThe more compact Zipp Mini features the exact same design, but in a smaller body. It\u2019s also a bit less powerful with 60 watts. As a comparison, the original Zipp also promised 60 watts.\n\nOther than that, the two devices share the same features, starting with 8 to 10 hours of battery life, Bluetooth 4.1 aptX and Wi-Fi. On the software side, if Bluetooth isn\u2019t your thing, you can stream music using Spotify Connect as well as AirPlay. The speaker now natively supports up to 5 Internet radio stations controlled directly from the speaker.\n\nIn other words, these speakers are packed with wireless streaming options. It\u2019s unclear whether they will support Chromecast Audio in a future software update, but it seems like the speakers have all the hardware features needed to support Chromecast-enabled apps.\n\nAnd then, there is the new multi-room focus with SoundSpaces. This is a new thing for Libratone, and I\u2019m glad to see that they thought about a flexible setup. You can very easily group your speakers together in the Libratone app, which is great if you want to play the same thing in multiple rooms or not \u2014 you don\u2019t have to make a final decision when you set up your speakers.\n\nTo link to speakers together, you just drag one on top of the other in the app. You can also just press the SoundSpaces button on the two speakers to pair them. You don\u2019t need any bridge, they will communicate over your Wi-Fi network.\n\nThe new speakers are cheaper than the previous version. The Libratone Zipp costs $299 while the Zipp Mini costs $249. I have used the previous Zipp, and it both sounded and looked great. The wireless features made it one of the most versatile speakers I\u2019ve ever owned.\n\nLibratone\u2019s approach is different from Sonos as you don\u2019t have to use a separate app to pick your music. While the Sonos app is better than it used to be, I\u2019d rather use the Spotify app to play my Spotify content.", "author": "Romain Dillet", "date": "2015-10-20 08:08:59"},

Venture capital investments in Canada totaled around $2 billion in 2014.\n\nCanada\u2019s largest newspaper, The Globe and Mail, took notice of the boom and tallied up 21 large-scale venture funding deals in Canadian tech, totaling $784 million. One company included on their list was Vision Critical, a customer intelligence software company\u00a0I started in Vancouver just as the 2000 tech bubble was bursting. Since those dark days, I\u2019ve seen the Canadian entrepreneurship grow into the juggernaut it has become today.\n\nThe road hasn\u2019t always been smooth. Tech\u2019s collapse 15 years ago left us with a conservative investment climate in the world economy and, as a result, many companies stunted. At the same time, Canada\u2019s most famous tech export\u00a0\u2014 BlackBerry\u00a0\u2014 lost its way, dropping from a $55 billion valuation to $7 billion this year, with only 1 percent market share. The company has shed 10,000 employees since 2011.\n\nThe one upside of BlackBerry\u2019s collapse has been the migration of talent to rising tech startups like cloud-based accounting software firm Freshbooks, video performance analysis software provider Vidyard, job hunting platform Careerify (recently scooped up by LinkedIn) and communications software firm Eleven-x. BlackBerry talent is now the backbone of companies like Vancouver\u2019s social media management service Hootsuite (valued at $1 billion) and Kitchener\u2019s educational platform D2L (which has raised $165 million in capital).\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of the BlackBerry exodus was Shopify, a retail software company based in the Canadian capital of Ottawa \u2014 a city that hasn\u2019t had much of a tech reputation since the collapse of that other one-time multinational telecom giant, Nortel. Shopify\u2019s trajectory is the envy of every Canadian startup: co-founder Tobi L\u00fctke realized that the e-commerce system he\u2019d developed for his online snowboard store, founded in 2006, was in fact the most valuable part of the company. He refocused, built out fast and his software is now used by 162,000 merchants in 150 countries (and counting). This past spring, the company raised $131 million in an initial public offering, hitting a valuation of $1.27 billion \u2014 one of those rare unicorn sightings.\n\nThis much tech activity has created one problem: not enough talent. It can be tough to find qualified workers. This is where our universities, public-private partnerships and a few innovative enterprises have come to the rescue.\n\nLast year, multi-billion dollar enterprise software company SAP\u00a0launched a program in Canada to support education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and in so doing to build direct bridges between students and technology careers. The federal government has also made it easier for employers to obtain the talent they need by improving foreign credential recognitions. And Canada\u2019s\u00a0universities continue to invest in building and growing tech programs through both public and private partnerships.\n\nIn March,\u00a0WESCAM, an Ontario-based imaging systems company, announced plans to invest $2 million in a collaboration with Canadian universities to help train a future security and\u00a0defense\u00a0technology workforce. And Canadian coders are taking matters into their own hands, learning with and from each other.\u00a0Coding clubs like Ladies Learning Code, HackerYou, Bitmaker Labs, BrainStation and Camp Tech\u00a0are popping up and growing throughout the country.\n\nCanadian pride aside, it can be difficult for Canada, with its relatively small population, to compete in the global market against countries like the U.S. and China, but we have our own advantages when it comes to attracting top talent. Few nations can compete with our quality of life \u2014 the World Bank finds that Canadians enjoy among the highest standards of living in the world. Universal healthcare for all residents doesn\u2019t hurt, either.\n\nCanada\u2019s Start-Up Visa is the first of its kind in the world, linking immigrant entrepreneurs with experienced private sector organizations that have expertise in working with startups. Proximity to the American tech scene is another advantage: Vancouver is a short flight from Silicon Valley and Toronto is just an hour from New York City. Companies like Facebook, Apple and Twitter, attracted by the buzz, have opened satellite offices in Toronto and Vancouver, and are busy recruiting talent.\n\nThe country that gave you BlackBerry has more in store (don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be another Justin Bieber). Look out for Kik, Recon, Wavo, Bionym and many others on the horizon. Canada is\u00a0a hotbed for wearable tech, in particular.\u00a0Thalmic Labs (Myo), InteraXon (Muse), Neptune (Pine) and others all shipped out products in 2014.\n\nWhy this obsession with wearables? Some of the credit can go to Canada\u2019s outdoorsy sensibility: wearables are exactly what you need when you\u2019re a health nut. This is especially the case in Vancouver, where many office workers devote an afternoon a week to group hikes up the nearby Grouse Grind mountain trail. Remember, Vancouver is the same city that gave birth to active yoga wear brand Lululemon.\n\nI myself have a Muse headband that senses brainwaves to help me learn to stay focused better.

So you may ask what is that and why do I need that? It\u2019s better than sliced bread, and let me tell you why.\n\nMany developers are using these trendy cloud hosting services, such as DigitalOcean, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Computing and Microsoft Azure. It adds a level of abstraction and flexibility compared to good old servers.\n\nIn particular, it\u2019s great if you want to run your apps in multiple data centers, replicate your application everywhere. But it gets complicated when you need to manage a network. Replacing a droplet (cloud server) isn\u2019t as easy as it should be as you need to tell your other droplets that one of your droplet doesn\u2019t have the same IP address.\n\nThink of it as a major dependency on your mailperson \u2014 they know everyone and all the addresses in your town and can help you if someone has moved to a new house, but maybe you don\u2019t want to rely on them every time you\u2019re looking for an address.\n\nMeet floating IPs. If I understand these things correctly, DigitalOcean\u2019s new feature lets you keep your IPs and assign them to any droplet in the same data center. You IP addresses are attached to your accounts, and not to your instances. I think it works like Amazon\u2019s EC2 Elastic IP feature.\n\nThere are many use cases, but one of my favorites is the emergency scenario because who doesn\u2019t love a good disaster movie. Let\u2019s say one of your droplet completely breaks down. It\u2019s unfixable, or it will take hours to fix. Instead of tweaking with your droplet, you can boot up a new droplet with a saved image and assign the old IP to the new IP \u2014 I call this a miracle.\n\nEven better, instead of recovering from an image, you can run a backup droplet that replicates everything your production droplet does. Whenever something happens to your production droplet, you can just move the IP and voil\u00e0! I\u2019m sure you can even find ways to script everything so you don\u2019t have to reassign the IP manually.\n\nYou can take advantage of floating IPs for two load balancers for example. Isn\u2019t it great? DigitalOcean now has deployed 8 million cloud servers for 700,000 developers. Not bad, not bad at all!", "author": "Romain Dillet", "date": "2015-10-20 07:33:25"},

Each of you has your own profile, and you can chat internally with your squad, but you can also look at other groups and swipe yes or no to indicate whether you\u2019d be interested in meeting up.\n\nSo is this basically just Tinder for groups? Not exactly. Founder and CEO Adam Liebman said the idea isn\u2019t to create a dating app, where there\u2019s inevitably lot of weight (romantic, sexual, whatever) on the meeting. Squad is designed to facilitate more casual meetups \u2014 sure, it could lead to dating or a hookup, but that\u2019s not the main goal.\n\n\u201cDo I want to go out and have a guaranteed good time with friends and probably don\u2019t meet that special someone?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr do I go out on a date, where the chances that they\u2019re our soulmate are very slim, but there\u2019s this weight that explicitly hangs over you.\u201d\n\nNaturally, Liebman is in the \u201cgood time with friends\u201d column. He said the idea came from a trip to Montreal, where he \u201chacked Tinder\u201d by turning his profile into a group profile that allowed him and his friends to meet new people while traveling, an approach that led to interactions that were \u201cfun, organic and not creepy.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re already wondering who is or isn\u2019t in your \u201csquad,\u201d but don\u2019t worry \u2014 it\u2019s not permanent. Squads are,\u00a0by their nature,\u00a0ephemeral. As Liebman put it, \u201cA squad is who you\u2019re going out with.\u201d You can have one squad tonight, and a different one tomorrow. Similarly, the connections between squads will only last for 24 hours \u2014 so you\u2019ve got a deadline\u00a0to make plans and share contact info.\n\nLiebman gave me a bit more detail about how the app works, like how there\u2019s\u00a0an internal chat within squads but also chats between different squads.\u00a0At a certain point, it started to seem like a lot of work just to connect with another random group of friends, but Liebman argued that it\u2019s meant to be \u201canalogous to how those dynamics play out in real life.\u201d\n\nThink of the times you\u2019ve been out with friends and started chatting up another group at the same bar. Or when you\u2019ve been with one group of friends and started texting someone to convince them to come over, and maybe bring their friends too. That\u2019s the basic idea here, just in an app, and not limited to your bar or your social circle.\n\nLiebman contrasted this approach with group dating apps like Grouper, where there are usually two people (one from each group) who\u2019ve connected, and they\u2019ve brought their friends along for the ride. The problem there, he said, is that even if the date ends up going well, \u201ctwo-thirds of the people there are going to have a poor user experience.\u201d And the group dating approach is more formal than Squad\u2019s, with a designated time and place (and usually the expectation of unisex groups, while Squad\u2019s squads can be mixed gender).\n\nLiebman emphasized that with Squad, there are \u201cno strings attached.\u201d If you meet up\u00a0with another squad but\u00a0the two groups are \u201cnot vibing\u201d and one of them wants to leave, well, no big deal. Heck, it\u2019s fine if you try to meet up and they never show up at all, because even in the worst case scenario, \u201cYou\u2019re still having your night out with your friends.\u201d\n\nThe Squad app is free. Liebman said the current focus is on \u201ccreating a great product,\u201d but eventually, he plans to make money through brand advertising, as well as promotions from nearby businesses and events.\n\nUpdate:\u00a0Squad says its group-matching only works in New York City for now, but there are plans to add other major cities later this year.", "author": "Anthony Ha", "date": "2015-10-20 05:00:00"},

The company posted revenues of $33.2 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.04. Both beat analysts\u2019 estimates: they had been expecting sales of $32.94 billion on an EPS of $1.02.\n\nNet income was $4.2 billion, up 9.9 percent on the same quarter a year ago.\n\n\u201cVerizon continues to grow earnings by delivering network reliability and superior value that continues to attract new customers,\u201d said Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam in a statement. \u201cVerizon Wireless posted another quarter of quality connections growth \u2013 even better than in the second quarter \u2013 while maintaining high customer loyalty and profitability. Meanwhile, fios customer growth also improved from the previous quarter. We expect future revenue growth from mobile over-the-top video, including digital advertising, and the Internet of Things.\u201d\n\nBreaking out into specific segments, Verizon Wireless had a quarter buoyed by new device sales. It reported revenues of\u00a0$23 billion, up 5.4 percent over a year ago. While service revenues of\u00a0$17.6 billion were\u00a0down 4.1 percent, equipment revenues almost doubled to\u00a0$4.3 billion,\u00a0\u201cas more customers chose to buy new devices with installment pricing.\u201d The company now has 110.8 million retail connections, up 4.3 percent; and 105.8 postpaid subscribers, up 4.9 percent, adding 1.3 million in total in the quarter.\n\nWireline, meanwhile, continues to play second fiddle to Verizon\u2019s wireless business. Consumer revenues in Q3 were $4 billion, up 2.8 percent on a year ago, with the company\u2019s fiber-based fios services accounting for 79 percent of all sales at $3.4 billion. (Fios is also growing faster, up 7.5%.) The company has 17.4 million fios digital subscriptions and 18.7 million standard voice subscribers.\n\nThe results come at a time when Verizon\u00a0\u2014 with its\u00a0legacy in providing fixed and wireless telephony services \u2014 is trying to make a more concerted shift to new technologies like video and new revenue streams that ride on top of that new tech, such as mobile video advertising. This was the rationale for buying AOL for $4.4 billion, and AOL itself subsequently acquiring more of its own mobile ad assets\u00a0in the form of Millennial Media.\n\nThe shift has also been playing out in Verizon\u2019s product developments. They\u00a0have included the launch of the\u00a0Go90 mobile video service, which is aimed at a younger demographic and in general people who are watching their entertainment on mobile screens. The iOS and Android app is ad-supported and free and includes shows from traditional\u00a0TV networks as well as\u00a0online video and content from multi-channel networks and live events. We\u2019ll be listening to today\u2019s earnings call to see if Verizon sheds any light on how well this has done since launching officially earlier this month.\n\nOther product moves have been more under the hood but no less important: the include the company\u00a0merging\u00a0its own so-called \u201csupercookie\u201d user tracking services from\u00a0its own network with\u00a0AOL\u2019s own browser-based ad network tracking.\n\nBut perhaps more significantly for Wall Street, the shift has also been playing out in Verizon\u2019s bottom line.\u00a0Last quarter,\u00a0Verizon beat on profits but fell short on revenue, and while the company raised its quarterly dividend in September\u00a0in the interim period it also\u00a0issued a notice that warned that growth\u00a0may stall in the future.\n\n\u201cFull-year 2016 earnings may plateau at 2015 levels as the company manages near-term impacts,\u201d according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0based on remarks by Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam. \u201cThese impacts include the commercial model change in wireless, year-over-year wireline financial comparisons following the expected first-half 2016 sale of operations to Frontier Communications Corp., and the ramp up of new business models for wireless video and IoT.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, though, growth continues well and clear, with today\u2019s 3.3 percent increase surpassing Q2\u2019s.", "author": "Ingrid Lunden", "date": "2015-10-20 04:38:41"},

That could include\u00a0carefully-crafted web copy, blog entries and FAQs along with\u00a0user-generated ratings and reviews. For many companies, at least some of this content is spread out across the site without any real connection between the product pages and the content that supports it.\n\nSAP has a theory that spreading all of this content asunder\u00a0makes it rather difficult for consumers to make informed decisions about their purchases \u2014 and this goes for any type of sale, whether a consumer device like a camera or something more complex like an enterprise technology purchase.\n\nThat\u2019s why the company came out with a new product today at the\u00a0Hybris customer conference,\u00a0called SAP Jam Communities, Edition for SAP Hybris Commerce. The lack of poetry in the name notwithstanding, this product is designed to help companies create a more coherent link between all of the content related to the product and the product itself.\n\nJust to parse that title for you for those who aren\u2019t familiar with SAP, Jam is the company\u2019s community product, created several years ago to facilitate\u00a0employee communication. Hybris is an ecommerce product SAP\u00a0bought in 2013. Bringing the two technologies together, SAP is hoping to create\u00a0sites and apps that help consumers when\u00a0they need it most with an appropriate level of content, whether from the company or community.\n\nTo achieve that, the company\u00a0says the tool\u00a0was built with what it\u00a0called \u201can API-first\u201d approach.\u00a0In practice this means, that every component of the service is containerized, delivered as a micro-service and pluggable into any web page or app. This should allow customers to build a customized ecommerce experience that can adjust the appropriate amount of content,\u00a0depending on the product\u2019s complexity.\n\nFor example, if the product involves\u00a0a fairly easy\u00a0buying decision like a $10 external battery for your cell phone, then simple ratings and reviews will probably suffice, but as the buying decision gets more complex, it requires a more detailed content from various sources to walk the buyer through the purchase process \u2014 like say a car or\u00a0a wind turbine\n\nThe eventual goal of any ecommerce\u00a0tool\u00a0is to get the visitor to buy something without leaving, and to that end, each page includes whatever content the system designers might deem necessary for a particular product, and a Buy\u00a0button. In\u00a0the case of a\u00a0more complex product, buyers might see a button for contacting\u00a0a sales person, distributor or dealer, who can provide more information\u00a0and\u00a0begin to push the sale further along.\n\nSAP is hoping that this approach has advantages over traditional content marketing and ecommerce strategies where it has been difficult to measure the ROI of the\u00a0content part of the process. That\u2019s because the content has sometimes lacked a coherent connection to the buying experience itself, often left on a disconnected landing page.\n\nBy including more of the content within the sales process\u00a0instead of in\u00a0a separate place, the company\u00a0believes it should make it easier to measure the effectiveness of your content against actual sales, giving companies easier access to data\u00a0that had previously been much more difficult to tease out.\n\nSAP officials hinted that this could\u00a0be the first of a series of enterprise-community products. eCommerce was a natural fit, especially since the company owns Hybris, but building the product using micro services was an intentional strategy to make the product transfer more easily to other use cases in the future.", "author": "Ron Miller", "date": "2015-10-20 04:00:46"},

The U.S. search giant is backing\u00a0Mobvoi, a three-year-old company specializing in mobile voice technology.\n\nThe duo already have business ties. Mobvoi is the company that Google picked to bring Android Wear, its operating system for wearables, to China, so this deal\u00a0takes things up to the next level.\n\nThe size of the investment, which is a Series C round for Mobvoi, has not been disclosed, but\u00a0Mobvoi co-founder Yuanyuan Li confirmed that Google has become a minority shareholder. The deal, she said, takes the company to $75 million in investment to date. Since Mobvoi previously raised $10 million Series B and $1.6 million Series A rounds, Google\u2019s investment is just shy of $65 million.\n\nUpdate: Mobvoi has clarified to TechCrunch that it raised previously unannounced funding rounds so the amount invested by Google is lower than the $60-65 million that we originally reported. The company declined to disclose the value of those unannounced rounds or Google\u2019s investment when we asked directly.\n\nBeyond the Android Wear deal, the two companies have plenty in common. Beijing-based\u00a0Mobvoi was started by ex-Googlers \u2014 CEO\u00a0Zhifei Li and CTO Mike Lei are both former research scientists with Google\u00a0U.S. \u2014 and Li\u00a0said\u00a0the company\u2019s DNA\u00a0is heavily influenced by the tech giant.\n\n\u201cWe\u00a0used the Google model from day one,\u201d she told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cWe wanted to have same culture and team values. The\u00a0co-operation [on bringing Android Wear to China] went really well\u2026 and [Google]\u00a0showed interest and decided to make an investment.\u201d\n\nOn the business and product side, Mobvoi is very Googley, too.\n\nThe company is probably best known for\u00a0Chumenwenwen, a mobile voice search service very much in the style of Siri or Google Now. The service is akin to a virtual butler, allowing users to\u00a0perform a range of tasks \u2014 including search, checking weather, buying items, and more \u2014 just using their voice. Li\u00a0said the company has struck deals with over 100 content partners to give users access to various services via\u00a0Chumenwenwen.\n\nMobvoi used its natural language technology to build out its own smartwatch software, too. Ticwear is a ROM that pairs with\u00a0Android Wear to make the Google-run operating system \u2014 which is kneecapped in China thanks to the government\u2019s blockage of Google services \u2014 work in mainland China.\n\nBeyond developing smartwatch software, which works on selected watches like the Moto 360,\u00a0Mobvoi went a step further and developed its own hardware: the Ticwatch. Li\u00a0said the company has sold 30,000 units of the smartwatch, which is priced between $160-$190 in China, but it remains focused on software development.\n\n\u201cOur goal isn\u2019t to be a watch manufacturer, [but] we\u2019re happy to see early adopters buying our product,\u201d she said.\n\nMobvoi said it will\u00a0use its new financing to hire talent from across the world and continue\u00a0refine its software services \u2014 Ticwear is updated every two weeks, much like Xiaomi\u2019s approach to its MIUI Android software \u2014 while it is plans to dip its toes into robotics and it is also\u00a0working on its own in-car software. That latter product is, again, much like a Chinafied version of Apple\u2019s CarPlay\u00a0or Android Auto from Google.\n\nGiven the many business/tech similarities between both companies and reports that the U.S. firm\u00a0is looking to open up its services in China \u2014 and in particular the Google Play Store \u2014 is today\u2019s investment a sign that Google has found the company in China to rebuild its business there?\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s even the possibility of\u00a0a full Google buyout in the future?\n\nNot so, according to Li.\n\n\u201cWe value this partnership a lot, and respect Google as an investor, [but it is] still a minority investor and we will focus on what we believe in and in our products,\u201d she told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re not changing what we\u2019ve planned, but there are definitely more opportunities [that will open up].\u201d\n\nGoogle, for its part, said it has \u201cnothing to announce at this time\u201d when we asked about potential plans to expand the scope of its partnership with Mobvoi and reopen the Google Play Store in China.\n\nThe company may be coy on its China plans, but today\u2019s news is\u00a0undoubted evidence that those plans do exist in some form. Google Inc and its Google Capital VC arm have made investments in China in the past \u2014 including a $5 million stake in music and video site Xuneli\u00a0way back in 2007 \u2014 but this deal with\u00a0Mobvoi is certainly its most strategic to date, and it sets off thoughts about what the search giant has up its sleeve.\n\nNote: This post has been\u00a0updated to correct the name of the Mobvoi spokesperson.

Along with a $6 million Series A that Attune Technologies raised in May from Norwest\u00a0and angel funding, this brings the startup\u2019s total venture funding so far to $17 million.\n\nFounder Arvind Kumar says there is still plenty of room to grow in India, where Attune\u2019s software currently handles 10 million patient records for 2,500 healthcare centers, but it also plans to launch soon in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa.\n\nAttune was founded to give smaller organizations without IT departments an affordable alternative to traditional hospital management software, which is often costly to deploy and maintain. The company charges a fixed monthly fee for SaaS products tailored to hospitals, diagnostics labs, and clinics.\n\n\u201cWhat the cloud and SaaS does is democratize a lot of software which was only available to large hospitals and labs before that could afford to pay a premium,\u201d says Kumar.

Kumar says Attune differentiates by being almost completely cloud-based, so\u00a0its products are not only more accessible, but will also be easier to adapt to mobile. These will include apps for doctors and lab technicians so they can access patient records and other data from their smartphones, as well as a mobile-first health screening app to track malaria and other communicable diseases and predict where they will spread.\n\nAttune\u2019s mobile technology may also help it cement partnerships with companies that offer home healthcare visits, a fast-growing market in India.", "author": "Catherine Shu", "date": "2015-10-20 03:07:35"},

LeTV said the investment is undisclosed, but the taxi firm\u00a0confirmed to TechCrunch that the amount is $700 million \u2014 which puts it in the billion dollar unicorn bracket.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty impressive valuation for a company that analyst reports estimate holds anything between\u00a00.7 percent\u00a0and 2.7 percent of the domestic ride sharing market. The billion dollar valuation is testament to the potential that investors see in the taxi market in China \u2014 a country\u00a0that Uber, for one, predicts will surpass its U.S. business soon \u2014 and likewise the size of LeTV\u2019s ambitions.\n\nLeTV is probably best known in China for its Xiaomi-like affordable\u00a0Android phones and its video site which is challenging Youku Tudou, the dominant player which Alibaba is bidding to buy for $3.8 billion.\n\nBut LeTV is also hard at work on robotics and cars.

While financially outgunned by Didi Kuaidi, the $15 billion valued company that recently raised $3 billion, and Uber, which raised $1.2 billion for its China business and is a planning a huge expansion in the country, it has carved a niche for providing Uber Black-like private cars.

The Tokyo-based company is hoping to change that with the launch of AI Works, a cloud-based enterprise resource planning platform that uses artificial intelligence to make data entry less tedious, faster, and more accurate. AI Works was unveiled yesterday at the HR Technology Conference in Las Vegas.\n\nThe company\u2019s products\u00a0are currently used by 7,000 organizations, but to make a dent in the U.S. market, Works Applications\u00a0has to convince companies to choose AI Works\u00a0over well-established products from competitors like Workday, SAP, and Oracle.\n\nWorks Applications, which has 4,000 employees, was founded in 1996 to provide ERP software to Asian companies. Chief executive officer Masayuki Makino says that at the time, products from most\u00a0U.S.-based companies had not been localized yet. Not only were languages an issue, but also the different financial calendars used in Japan and other countries. Works Applications built market share by taking a different approach from its competitors, which Makino says were focused on making software for clients in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nNow that Works Applications is one of Japan\u2019s top players, the company wants to expand beyond Asia. Over the last 20 years, Makino says, the user experience of ERP software has remained relatively stagnant, which gives Works Applications an opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shifted our mindset from guarding our number one position in Japan to becoming an innovative company and dramatically improving the productivity of users with breakthrough technology,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an interview last month.\n\nThe company claims that AI Works, which integrates spreadsheets, emails, online group chats, analytic tools, and other tools with cloud storage so users can collaborate on documents, cuts the amount of time employees spent on data entry in half. The idea behind its user interface will be familiar to people who rely on Google Autocomplete and Works Applications claims the software has a response time of 100 milliseconds or less. AI Works can be especially helpful for accounting and finance departments by predicting what items are being entered or automatically pulling numbers from receipts and other documents.\n\nWorks Applications will continue to expand in Asia (Singapore and China are both top priorities), but Makino says it is tackling the North American market \u201cbecause in the world of IT you have to nail America in order to be considered a global player.\u201d\n\nOf course, Works Applications faces the considerable challenge of convincing companies to switch over from their existing ERP software. Makino is confident that AI Works will be able to win over new customers through demonstrations and by keeping switchover costs low, but concedes that \u201cthere is no guarantee of success because this is our first experience marketing in the U.S.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, he claims that Works Applications has been able to convince most Oracle and SAP users in Japan to switch over to AI Works once they see the software in use. \u201cWhen it comes to the product, it\u2019s hard to anticipate that they will resist it,\u201d he says.", "author": "Catherine Shu", "date": "2015-10-20 12:30:39"},

Their new suite combines a cloud-based Integrated Development Environment with integrated game engines for physics and visualization. Along with that, Weeby.co also seamlessly integrates games with social networks and competitive play.\n\nWeeby.co wants to shorten the long process associated with developing apps for mobile devices. Instead of going through the tedious iOS development process and waiting for Apple to approve an app submitted to the store, developers can deploy and share games built in HTML5 as they are built. Much of this, Carter explained, is because HTML5 games today can be built with the same capabilities and features that were once restricted to native apps.\n\n\u201cYour phone is actually a development environment,\u201d said Carter. \u201cYou can actually build native iOS apps while running on iOS, or Android apps on an iOS device. Imagine you have two phones, one is your dev [elopement] phone, and another can be your debug phone.\u201d\n\nErnestine Fu, partner at Alsop Louie Ventures and an advisor to the company, explained that the ability to develop entirely on the cloud will give users a whole new set of powers.\n\n\u201cThe Weeby.co team is building the future for all mobile apps and games,\u201d Fu said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other system that lets you set breakpoints over LTE, with no configuration or provisioning.\u201d\n\nEach game engine supported by Weeby.co comes with a custom set of libraries meant for the Weeby.co platform. By keeping their entire system in the cloud, the company cuts down significantly on development time, taking 5 times less time than development in XCode.\n\nUsers currently have the option to download their HTML5 games, or instantly build them as native smartphone apps. However, if they so choose, Weeby.co will host games on their Amazon Web Services\u2019 Simple Storage Service account for free and send developers a hyperlink to where the game is hosted.\n\nLong-term, though, the company\u2019s goals are far more than just building a game development environment. Carter wants to be a game publisher as well, working with \u2018alternative\u2019 app stores based inside web browsers embedded inside apps like WeChat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of like Adobe plus Steam,\u201d said Carter. \u201cWe want to build the very best tools that make apps and games everywhere, and we have one right now which is faster and better than XCode and our other competitors.\u201d\n\nWhile the company intends to let anyone use the development environment, Weeby.co will treat content publication on their partner app stores as a premium service.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re intending to allow anyone to use the game developing IDE, but the professional side is the [publication] service,\u201d said Carter.\n\nAs grand as their current vision is, the company\u2019s vision for the future is even larger.\n\n\u201cWe have this vision of the future, where we want to facilitate the next generation of children learning to code,\u201d said Michael.\n\nThe inspiration for this came from MIT\u2019s Media Lab, which develops a visual programming language for children called Scratch, and allows children to make a copy of a game and start independent development on it, making their own modifications.\n\nWhether or not Weeby.co will be able to take the reins of development out of the hands of XCode and Apple remains to be seen. If the technology works as seamlessly as it did in the demo, the future will definitely be bright for the company.", "author": "Nitish Kulkarni", "date": "2015-10-19 07:05:01"},

You don\u2019t reawaken it and draw more attention to it than it might have received in the first place.\u201d (According to the Times, its Amazon piece has received more than five million page views already, making it among the outlet\u2019s most-read stories of the year.)\n\nOuting\u00a0Olson makes it worse, says Ein. \u201cNot only does it sound vindictive, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any time that it\u2019s wise for a company to get into the personal and confidential details of an employee\u2019s hiring or firing.\u201d\n\nIn\u00a0his post, Carney explains that Amazon felt compelled to take action when the New York Times wouldn\u2019t listen to its arguments. \u201cWe presented the Times with our findings several weeks ago, hoping they might take action to correct the record. They haven\u2019t, which is why we decided to write about it ourselves.\u201d\n\nUnlike Ein, crisis manager Jeff Eller approves\u00a0of Amazon\u2019s no-holds-barred\u00a0strategy, noting that it has worked effectively in the past, including in a similar tussle between the New York Times and Wal-mart last year. One day after the Times published an opinion piece\u00a0that characterized\u00a0Wal-mart as a \u201cnet drain on taxpayers,\u201d Wal-mart battled back, cheekily annotating the piece with notes that include, \u201cWe are the largest taxpayer in America. Can we see your math?\u201d\n\nSays Eller, who represented\u00a0Firestone in its tire recall in 2000\u00a0and\u00a0General Motors in its ignition switch recall last year, \u201cThere\u2019s this inherent perception that the Times is too big to tackle. But\u00a0I don\u2019t think so. They put their pants on just like everybody does.\u201d\n\nStill, fighting back aggressively is one thing. Fighting back long\u00a0after people have stopped talking about a story is another. Certainly, the\u00a0timing of Amazon\u2019s newest response\u00a0to the Times is, well,\u00a0strange.\n\nIndeed,\u00a0a third, top\u00a0crisis manager who asked not to be named has another theory about Amazon\u2019s latest lob, which is\u00a0that another shoe may be about\u00a0to\u00a0drop.\n\n\u201cIt could be that Amazon is pissed off,\u201d as seems to be the case, says this veteran of public relations.\u00a0\u201cAmazon could also be trying to issue a warning; it\u00a0could be that there\u2019s a class-action suit in the works.\u201d (Indeed, employment attorneys have previously suggested\u00a0that a\u00a0\u201ccreative attorney\u201d could probably make hay with the\u00a0anecdotes published in the Times.)\n\nA third possibility, suggests this person, is that \u201csomething else is coming that we have no line of sight into yet, like a news magazine like \u201860 Minutes\u2019 or \u201820/20\u2019 that\u2019s preparing a segment.\u201d\n\nCertainly, it wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented, given the many Times stories to be picked up by other outlets, including nightly news magazines. Amazon is understandably a popular topic for their viewers, too.\n\nAlas, only time will tell if the story of Amazon\u2019s workplace culture\u00a0fades away again or there\u2019s more to come.\n\nAsked about Carney\u2019s post today, a spokesman for \u201c60 Minutes\u201d said simply in an email, \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss what we may or may not be working on.\u201d", "author": "Connie Loizos", "date": "2015-10-19 04:25:37"},

And here are the first photos of it. When asked about an image dug up from a private Uber driver Facebook group by TechCrunch reader Dave Craige (seen below), Uber admitted that this is a mapping vehicle piloted by a human driver, like a Google Street View car, not a self-driving car prototype. The system was originally designed by Microsoft. Uber provided the image above.\n\nBack in June, we reported that Uber had acquired \u201cassets\u201d from the Microsoft Bing mapping team, including about 100 employees. But Uber refused to detail exactly what those assets included. One thought was mapping data. But now we know that Uber bought the camera-clad car system seen in the photo above from Microsoft. That way it could generate its own data.\n\nCraige pointed us to the photo below, originally posted by Alana Pratt Thomas. Some Twitter digging revealed other photos of the vehicle dating back as early at September 30:\n\nUber tells me the Uber-branded mapping cars have been on the road for a few months. The data they collect is being used to improve the Uber app\u2019s route suggestions and estimated time of arrival predictions.\n\nIn a statement, an Uber spokesperson told me:\n\n\u201cThis is an Uber mapping car. In June, Uber acquired a subset of the Microsoft Maps business and imagery collection technology was included as part of that acquisition. These cars have been on the road for the last several months collecting imagery that will help improve mapping features that are so integral to the Uber experience \u2014 such as routing and ETA calculations.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian reported in May that people in Pittsburgh had spotted an Uber self-driving car prototype that was also collecting image data, but Uber tells me that was for its separate autonomous vehicle project. Uber has cars on the road in Pittsburgh and Arizona working on self-driving cars.\n\nKnowing exactly how long it takes to get from one point to another is critical for Uber as it tries to build out complex algorithms for making carpooling efficient. Knowing that a certain alleyway is impassable or that an intersection includes restrictions like \u2018no left turns\u2019 will let it better allocate cars to carpoolers, or just give riders a better idea of when to be ready.\n\nUber at one point reportedly submitted a bid to buy Nokia\u2019s HERE mapping service, but later dropped out. It has made acquisitions like the Bing assets and deCarta to build out its own mapping expertise. Done right, Uber could give drivers a reliable in-app directions option instead of them instead opening Google\u2019s Maps and Waze apps.\n\nFor now, if you see this on the roads, it doesn\u2019t mean Uber is ready to ditch human independent contractors for artificial intelligence just yet. But those camera arrays on car roofs could eventually make your driver almost as efficient as a robot.", "author": "Josh Constine", "date": "2015-10-19 02:22:20"},

The Eora 3D scanner, however, is allowed because it takes 3D scans using a device that is surprisingly simple yet exceedingly complex and only uses one camera.\n\nCreated by Rahul Koduri and Asfand Khan of Sydney, Australia the project came about when they were working on concentrating solar rays. They have just launched their product on Kickstarter.\n\n\u201cThe eora 3D Scanner was born out of our own need for an affordable and highly-precise 3D scanner,\u201d said Koduri. \u201cWe needed to capture the specifications of a reflective parabolic dish that was used to track the sun\u2019s trajectory to improve solar power output. When we originally looked for what was available we were shocked that scanners that are precise to sub-100 microns cost atleast $5000.\u201d\n\nThe team began working on an early prototype and realized that they had a real product on their hands.\n\nThe system works by scanning the surface a green laser. The laser connects via Bluetooth to your phone camera and allows you to create a point cloud of the object in alarming detail. Best of all the system scans in full color \u2013 a unique feature that I haven\u2019t seen in a smaller scanner.\n\n\u201cThe eora 3D Scanner has a Green laser, as CMOS sensors in cameras are twice as sensitive to the green spectrum which allows for 3D Scanning in a variety of conditions even outdoors,\u201d said Koduri. \u201cThis is due to human beings evolving in green landscapes/brushes, so our eyes are also more sensitive to the green spectrum.\u201d\n\nThe models can be used in games, for 3D printing, and for prototyping. One scan the team showed me \u2013 an Assassin\u2019s Creed character \u2013 was surprisingly detailed for a simple scan. Scans can take as little as 3 minutes in some cases but more complex scans take a little longer. The system includes an automatic turntable to turn the object in space so you can capture all sides at sub-100 micron accuracy.\n\nEarly bird units cost $199 and the team is looking to raise $50,000. They\u2019re quite close and it looks like they\u2019ll be funded in a few hours. It\u2019s an exciting time to be alive for those who are actively binocular and this device is a testament to that fact. Sadly, due to my belief system we are unable to enjoy beautiful 3D scans.

The company\u2019s revenue miss appears to be scoring more credence from investors than its minor profit beat. The company\u2019s profit per share, using normal accounting methods (GAAP) was a slimmer $3.02.\n\nIBM\u2019s adjusted profit fell 9 percent compared to the year-ago period. Its GAAP profit fell a steeper 13 percent. IBM\u2019s revenue on an unadjusted basis fell 14 percent.\n\nThe venerable technology firm noted in its earnings report that it expects adjusted profit of $14.75 to $15.75 for the full year. That is down from its prior non-GAAP guidance during its second quarter report of $15.75 to $16.50 per share. That\u2019s not so good.\n\nIBM\u2019s revenue clocked its fourteenth\u00a0straight quarterly decline in the third quarter.\n\nNot all the news was bad.

Core debt, however, rose by $2.0 billion since the start of the year to $13.7 billion since last day of 2014.\n\nSumming quickly, IBM remains mired in a business transition. While its cloud revenues, and incomes from other future-focused products are increasing, the company is hardly done rebuilding itself. The revenue miss, the chronic top line\u00a0declines, and falling profitability paint the picture of a ship that has not yet turned around.\n\nAt the same time, IBM is massively profitable, and valuable.

Researchers at NYU have published a paper showing how to infect devices such as smartphones with the digital version of the disease.\n\nIn a paper titled \u201cMAGIC: Malicious Aging in Circuits/Cores,\u201d NYU computer scientists lay out a series of methods to attack hardware by aging integrated circuits rapidly and causing them to wear out. The effects of such an attack on a smartphone, for instance, could include slow performance or even failure of the device.\n\n\u201cGenerally when companies manufacture integrated circuits, they are built for a lifetime. When we studied the aging process, we observed it is input dependent. If you run certain programs, you can make the degradation occur faster,\u201d said Arun Kanuparthi, one of the authors of the paper at NYU. \u201cWhat we were able to do is create a malicious program that, when you run it on a phone, can crash it in just a month.\u201d\n\nWhy would anyone want to do that? There are many reasons that consumers \u2014\u00a0or even companies \u2014\u00a0might try to use such software to kill devices.\n\nThe first scenario the paper describes is the warranty scenario. \u201cLet\u2019s say you just bought a new phone,\u201d says Kanuparthi, \u201cand the company that manufactures that phone announces that they are launching a new model. You want that new phone, so you download this malicious app, run it on your phone, say that it is broken, and trade it in for the new model.\u201d Essentially, the software tortures the chip to death. \u201cThink of it this way,\u201d says Kanuparthi. \u201cIf you eat too many cheesy puffs and drink a lot of soda, what happens to you? We essentially put the transistors in the integrated circuit under a lot of stress by force feeding them.\u201d\n\nThe second scenario is the planned obsolescence scenario. In this scenario, a company seeking to drive sales of a newer device might intentionally degrade the performance of an older device already on the market in order to drive the consumer to upgrade. \u201cCompanies might want to force consumers to buy newer products,\u201d says Kanuparthi. \u201cThere have been several issues \u2014 the paper cites these \u2014 of really big companies\u00a0suspected of doing planned obsolescence. A Blu-ray player crashing a day before the warranty runs out, or a phone suddenly slowing down after a software patch, just before a new model is launched. Then you go to the store and try out the new phone and you see a blazing difference in the performance and are compelled to buy the new phone.\u201d\n\nThe third scenario is the state-sponsored hardware back door. \u201cIn this attack scenario, let\u2019s say a country purchases military equipment from another country. The country that sold the equipment might have friendly relations with its customer today, but who knows what happens ten years down the line,\u201d says Kanuparthi. The selling country may wish to maliciously age the devices and ruin their functionality by installing a software patch.\n\nThe researchers go on to lay out the effectiveness of their approach at beating mechanisms to mitigate these attacks, and a number of methods circuit makers might use to fend off malicious aging. Future research will look at how to mitigate these attacks on a variety of processor architectures. With recent deceptions such as the Volkswagen scandal, in which embedded software tricked emissions tests, consumer watchdogs and regulators alike should pay special attention to instances of hardware obsolescence, and keep an eye out for any curious case.", "author": "Justin Hendrix", "date": "2015-10-19 01:00:50"},

But it also shows how makers of these assistants might have to educate users on the breadth of what their services can do.\n\nAfter an early report from The Information, Facebook provided official details on its M project\u00a0in August. Built into Messenger, M lets users text in almost any request, from assistance with online chores to booking real-world services or making purchases on their behalf. Requests are currently fielded by a combination of Facebook workers and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe hope is that over time, the humans will teach the AI to do more and more complicated tasks on their own. If M succeeds and can be affordably rolled out, it could make people\u2019s lives easier while strengthening their loyalty to Facebook Messenger amid intense competition between chat apps. Though if it\u2019s too costly to scale, Facebook could burn a lot of money on the project.\n\nM could potentially earn revenue itself by taking a margin on top of purchases or services booked for people. But the big opportunity is for Facebook to lock users further into its ecosystem where it makes ample money on News Feed ads. One day, Facebook could even sell ads that convince you to initiate an M request that involves an advertiser\u2019s business.\n\n\n\n Right now, Facebook tells me the No. 1 type of request is for restaurant suggestions and reservations. People might know their desired food type, distance, price range, or some quality they\u2019re looking for in a restaurant, and M helps find them the one that fits and gets them a table.\n\nLocal search requests are the second most popular. Here, M assists people with finding local businesses, places, or services that solve their needs. Users might ask where they can buy, book an appointment for, or see something nearby, and M directs them.\n\nThe third top request type is for purchasing assistance. Rather than have to go to a store in person or deal with online payment flows, M could make purchases on someone\u2019s\u00a0behalf using the payment info they have on file with Facebook. This way a desire can turn into a delivered product with minimal effort on the user\u2019s part.\n\nOther top request types include ordering flowers, getting food, arranging travel, finding upcoming weather reports, and being reminded of approaching appointments.\n\nSome examples of M usage that Facebook saw include:\n\n\n\n These are not things that SMS or any random chat app can do.

Beyond just telling you that traffic is slow, Waze can tell you why \u2013 maybe there\u2019s an accident ahead, or a stalled vehicle.

Instead of a modern, clean aesthetic, Waze previously relied on a couple of menus \u2013 one with a cartoon-ish car icon to access the main menu, and the other map pin-shaped icon with an exclamation point in the middle for reporting incidents. And the map itself was messy and cluttered, making it hard to read.\n\nThe old version of Waze:\n\nWith the new version of the app, Waze offers a de-cluttered map, and it makes the alerting feature more prominent \u2013 it\u2019s an orange icon with a rounder pin.

When you\u2019re in a hurry \u2013 as drivers are behind the wheel (they\u2019re not supposed to be using the app in-route, but of course they do) \u2013 this makes it easier and faster to participate in the Waze community because\u00a0it\u2019s more obvious which button to press to add a report.\n\nIn addition, the updated app now features quick access to a contacts section (as indicated by the mail envelope icon), where you can share directions with\u00a0your contacts, send your location, and your ETA with a tap.\n\nA bottom menu also slides up when tapped to offer you easy access to things like alternate routes, the \u201cadd a stop\u201d feature, as well as a shortcut to sending your ETA to a friend or family member.\n\nNearly everything you do in Waze now takes fewer taps, which is another one of the\u00a0bigger improvements over the prior version. And the menus themselves have been redesigned, too, to be quicker to use. For instance, the reporting menu now uses big, brightly-colored, round buttons for things like reporting accidents, road hazards, police, and more.\n\nWaze 4.0 also lets you sync your Calendar to the app so you can receive alerts reminding you when to leave, based on traffic conditions. The company says it has made other improvements, too, like better battery life.\n\nUnfortunately, the new app still relies on its bubbly,\u00a0cartoon-ish icons. This is a personal preference, of course, but I think it\u2019s time to move away from this sort of juvenile look. It\u2019s frankly just\u00a0sort of silly to see cars with bows on their head, or pacifiers in their mouth, or wearing little crowns in an\u00a0app aimed at adults old enough to drive a car.\n\nThe new design is certainly an improvement, but Waze still hasn\u2019t delivered a truly sleek look-and-feel.\u00a0Even now, there\u2019s too much to look at on the screen.\n\nBecause Waze already\u00a0shows things other mapping apps don\u2019t have \u2013 like the\u00a0other cars and graphics like ads for business as little road signs \u00a0\u2013 it needs to be even more\u00a0careful about what other buttons should\u00a0appear. Now it features\u00a0an\u00a0orange reporting button, a MPH indicator, the time, ETA, and distance, and a big button for finding your current geo-location. This latter item is positioned to the left and sort of up near the middle of the screen,\u00a0though Apple and Google Maps put this feature closer to the bottom of the screen.\n\nPlus, when you tap on the screen, tons of other buttons appear, including the compass, sound toggle, zooming feature, and when at a particular zoom level, your location finder. Combined with all the car icons and icons of signs, alert icons, and more, Waze still struggles with offering a truly clean-looking\u00a0map.\n\nOff the top of my head, I can still spot a number of things I\u2019d change. For starters, Waze needs to ditch the MPH button entirely \u2013 drivers look at this on their car\u2019s dashboard anyway. The geo-location feature needs to be much smaller and closer to the bottom of the screen.The bottom of the screen doesn\u2019t need a greeting (e.g. \u201cGood Afternoon\u201d) when no route is in progress. And there\u2019s no need to flag how many new messages you have and add a red dot to indicate you have unread mail \u2013 this could all be handled with a push notification and red icon badge on your iOS homescreen.\n\nThat said, Waze certainly looks better than before, if not great.\n\nThe updated app, Waze 4.0, is live on the iTunes Store now with an Android release soon to follow.", "author": "Sarah Perez", "date": "2015-10-19 10:46:16"},

The department\u00a0will be creating a task force comprising public and private industry leaders\u00a0to devise exactly how the registration system will work.\n\nSecretary Foxx noted that the agency will be acting fast to develop and implement the registration plan. Specifically, the DOT hopes the task force will have recommendations in place by the middle of November, with a registration being implemented before the end of December.\n\nFoxx said that registration will reinforce the need for hobbyists and drone operators to learn the airspace rules before they fly, and use their devices safely. Secondly, he noted that registration will allow these rules to be enforced, and let the FAA identify any operator who breaks these rules.\n\nThe agency said that while it\u00a0is currently easy\u00a0to locate the actual drone that may have violated illegal airspace, it\u2019s difficult to find the operator of the offending drone, and this registration will close that loophole.\n\nThis announcement comes after a sharp rise in \u201cnear misses\u201d between aircrafts and drones throughout the U.S. over the last year.

The company says that it will give interested customers access to Google Apps for Work for free, while they\u2019re still under an enterprise agreement (EA) with another provider. While Google didn\u2019t call out\u00a0Microsoft or IBM by name when making the announcement, it\u2019s well understood\u00a0that these are the top competitors for its Google Apps productivity suite and related tools.\n\nIn addition, Google directly\u00a0references the two competitors\u00a0on its \u201coffer\u201d page for the new promotion.\n\nAccording to a Google blog post, the company will cover the fees associated with Google Apps for Work until the customer\u2019s existing contract runs out. And it says it will chip in on some of the deployment costs following the earlier contract\u2019s expiration, by\u00a0also connecting the new customer with a Google for Work Partner.\n\nThe company claims that customers can see cost savings of up to 70 percent by switching. This figure is based on a basic Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, Google explains\u00a0(PDF) on the Google Apps website.\n\nThere are some caveats, of course. Google is capping the amount it covers for deployment at $25 per user, so the cost to switch is not necessarily going to be \u201czero.\u201d However, there will be no bill for Google Apps for Work\u00a0until the prior EA runs out.\n\nMicrosoft, of course, has been making some fierce inroads of its own with its Office 365 software. For example, this summer it gained a huge win by signing up GE to deploy its platform to its more than\u00a0300,000 employees worldwide.

With more than four floors and 7,300 square feet of space, the building has 19 private bedrooms costing anywhere from $1,800 to $1,950. Along with the private rooms, comes four communal kitchens, a large dining room, work space and a roof deck.\n\nThe Common opening comes at a time when venture-backed companies like WeWork are piling into co-living as a way to use urban residential space more cost-efficiently and to attract Millennials, who are delaying marriage and families later and later. In New York, older tenant laws control the number of tenants that can be listed on a lease, and brokers often charge upwards of a month\u2019s rent to find apartments. That makes it difficult for newcomers to find housing easily compared to other American cities. On the property owner side, Common\u2019s pitch is that they can partner to purchase whole vacant buildings and turn them into stable, market-rate income streams while removing the hassles of leasing and property management.\n\nOver the summer, Common partnered with a local New York City real estate developer to buy Crown Heights building earlier this year. They invested a little less than $1 million in re-modeling the space.\n\nThey kept four suites or units in tact, but opened up large dining and work areas. \u201cThe whole idea here is is to use common areas and activate typically under-utilized space,\u201d Hargreaves told me in a video tour via Skype.\n\nCommon built in several smart phone features like Bluetooth door locks compatible with keycards, phones and the Apple watch, and Nest thermostats. Through Hargreaves\u2019 connections, they added mattresses from the startup Casper, along with furniture from Restoration Hardware and West Elm.\n\n\u201cAesthetically, I would say it\u2019s mid-century Modern with some Hudson Valley Americana built into it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to evoke the neighborhood as well. A lot of the art is from Crown Heights and the furniture are things you would find in a traditional Brownstone.\u201d\n\nServices include free laundry, regular deliveries of coffee, tea and paper towels, and weekly cleanings in bathrooms and common areas. Utilities and wi-fi is baked into the price.\n\nFor the communal element, Common is bringing in Sunday potlucks and other kinds of event programming. He partnered with his old General Assembly co-founder Matthew Brimer, who went on to create the morning dance party Daybreaker. They\u2019re bringing in Common residents to the next one. Hargreaves declined to share anything about the socioeconomic make-up of the residents, saying that he wanted residents to speak for themselves after they move in. Crown Heights is a majority black neighborhood, that has seen its African-American share of the population decline from 79 percent to 70 percent between 2000 and 2010.\n\nAbout 250 people have applied for the 19 available Common spots so far in the neighborhood.\n\nSome journalists have been critical of the co-living business model, with Buzzfeed calling it the latest way to \u201cmonetize the wantrepreneur lifestyle.\u201d\n\nBut this is a narrow interpretation of what is happening in urban housing markets in the United States.\n\nCo-living, or co-housing, is the reincarnation of a very old idea. From the Industrial Revolution onward, residential hotels, or buildings with month-to-month tenancy and no in-unit kitchens, were a major part of American urban living in the late 19th and early 20th century. They served a wide range of price tiers from luxury palace hotels on down through middle-income residential hotels and then into lower-income lodging houses and tenements. They were a response to overwhelming population growth stimulated by the Industrial Revolution, when the American population went from being 25.6 percent rural in 1870 to 51.2 percent urban in 1920. In San Francisco, residential hotels went from serving 1/16th of the city population in 1880 to 1 out of every 10 people by 1910. They later fell out of favor as the American middle-class left for the suburbs in the mid-20th century, turning residential hotels into the housing choice of last resort for the poor left behind in the urban core.\n\nToday, coastal cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco are growing once again, with an upward trend in population growth over three-and-a-half decades since 1980. This resurgence is putting an immense amount of pressure on inner-city neighborhoods that is obvious in gentrification battles from Brooklyn to the Mission District and on into Oakland.\n\nUnless low-rise, suburban areas ringing the urban core step up and add housing and unless cities start scrutinizing the higher-end of the market where external capital is sitting in vacant units as pure investment rather than shelter, there will be an extraordinary amount of pressure to make urban residential space more efficient. At the same time, housing starts have been extremely slow into this economic recovery because of the hangover left after the last financial crisis \u2014 which was housing centric. Multi-family development and apartment buildings are leading the way, but federal housing policies and local zoning rules still favor single-family detached homes even though the pressure is for entire metropolitan regions to densify.\n\nThe entrepreneurial response to these pressures could take the form of more unscrupulous hacker hotels with $1,800 bunkbeds, or it can go in the direction of micro-units and other kinds of communal living.\n\nAs was true during the suburban tract home era, housing can take many forms from cheap, speculative development to more intentional design.\u00a0Hargreaves is hoping to grab the middle to upper-middle segment of the market.\n\nThis is a risky business considering the amount of upfront capital that is necessary\u00a0to compete in real estate markets. Earlier this year, San Francisco-based Campus went under as\u00a0the unit economics on most of its properties were upside down. They could only make profit on houses\u00a0that had more than eight or nine rooms. Still, the company managed to wind down the company by turning over master leases to the majority of its tenants, keeping the startup\u2019s customers housed even as the startup went out of business.\n\nWeWork has also been expected to enter the\u00a0space with a WeLive product, which it projected to bring in $605.9 million in revenue three years after launch in a leaked investor slide deck published by Buzzfeed. It has been working on a large building in Crystal City in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area.\n\nFor now, Hargreaves is focused on New York City with two buildings slated for opening in Brooklyn.He has raised about $7.35 million from Maveron and other investors this year.", "author": "Kim-Mai Cutler", "date": "2015-10-19 09:00:09"},

The applications in question had been using an SDK from a Chinese advertising company called\u00a0Youmi\u00a0which was accessing this information by way of private APIs, the report found.\n\nNearly all\u00a0of the developers were located in China so, for now, this appears to be an isolated incident. However, the larger concern here\u00a0has to do with how long this activity had been taking place \u2013 and what that means in terms of Apple\u2019s App Store review process, given that it hadn\u2019t caught this suspect activity until being alerted to it by a third party.\n\nAccording to SourceDNA, Youmi had apparently been experimenting with what sort of information it could pull from users\u2019 devices for some time. Nearly two years ago, for example, the firm began obfuscating a call to get the frontmost (currently running) app\u2019s name \u2013 seemingly a small test of what it could sneak into the App Store. And when it realized that it was able to get this through Apple\u2019s App Review process, it then began to use the same obfuscation technique to request other data, including the advertising ID.\n\nThe ad ID\u00a0can be accessed for tracking ad clicks, but given that\u00a0Youmi was surreptitiously collecting it, the firm may have been using it for other purposes, the report speculates.\n\nIn addition, SourceDNA noted that while Apple had been locking down private APIs in order to prevent apps from reading the platform serial number in iOS 8, Youmi worked around this by enumerating peripheral devices, like the battery system. It would then send those serial numbers as the hardware identifier.\n\nSourceDNA, which helps app developers\u00a0improve their code and address security flaws, says it found what Youmi was up to when it was updating its Searchlight product to check for use of private APIs \u2013 something that should get developers\u2019 apps banned from the App Store. Surprisingly, it actually found quite a few apps that had gotten through.\n\nIn total, SourceDNA came across\u00a0256 apps with an estimated total of 1 million downloads that had been using a version of the Youmi SDK that was\u00a0violating user privacy. However, the company adds\u00a0it\u2019s possible that the developers themselves didn\u2019t realize what the SDK was doing, as the user data is uploaded to Youmi\u2019s server.\n\nWhat\u2019s more concerning here is the implication of SourceDNA\u2019s findings. The obfuscation method is fairly simple, the company says, and the apps have been using it for a long period of time. In fact, SourceDNA\u2019s founder Nate Lawson tells us this has been going on for about a year-and-a-half.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned other published apps may be using different but related approaches to hide their malicious behavior,\u201d a SourceDNA blog post states. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to add new features to our engine to discover anomalous behavior in app code and find out if this is the case.\u201d\n\nSourceDNA submitted its\u00a0report to Apple, and Apple replied by offering the company a statement (see below) indicating the apps in question had been banned. Apple says it\u2019s now working with developers who were using Youmi\u2019s SDK to get their apps updated to be in compliance with Apple\u2019s guidelines so they can return to the App Store.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified a group of apps that are using a third-party advertising SDK, developed by Youmi, a mobile advertising provider, that uses private APIs to gather private information, such as user email addresses and device identifiers, and route data to its company server. This is a violation of our security and privacy guidelines. The apps using Youmi\u2019s SDK have been removed from the App Store and any new apps submitted to the App Store using this SDK will be rejected.

Not because I don\u2019t believe it, but precisely because I do.\n\nIt comes down to this: The more angels invest, the more I grow suspect.\n\nIn other words, at times during the business cycle when angel investing becomes especially robust, it tends to serve as a harbinger of market decline. That has been my experience over my 31 years \u2014 and five distinct cycles\u00a0\u2014 observing the windfalls and downfalls of Silicon Valley\u2019s private adventurers.\n\nThe present moment certainly has the appearance of an angel-inspired windfall. Since 2011, the size of the average angel round has grown 60 percent, and pre-money valuations have grown 20 percent. We\u2019re seeing the broadest and deepest participation we\u2019ve ever seen in Silicon Valley from angel investors, seed syndicates and other groups of individual investors infusing companies with larger and larger rounds.\n\nIn 2014, angels invested a total of $24.1 billion. These investments are, of course, risky\u00a0\u2014 which is why they rarely account for more than 10 percent of an angel\u2019s portfolio. They\u2019re also something of a discretionary investment, so an angel\u2019s appetite and available liquidity tends to evaporate in the heat of uncertain market conditions.\n\nIn some sense, the sine curve tracking the rise and fall of the angel cycle tends to follow behind the sine curve tracking the rise and fall of the broader business cycle. When angel investing begins to peak, it can be a sign that the rest of the startup investment market is undergoing a more fundamental shift.\n\nBill Gurley seems to believe that\u2019s happening now. He tweeted, \u201cwe may be nearing the end of a cycle where growth is valued more than profitability.\u201d Whether or not he\u2019s right about the nature of the shift that\u2019s underway, once it fully takes hold, angels are likely to become dramatically more cautious. Some will wait for the ground to solidify. Many will cut their losses and get out of the market entirely.\n\nSo if you\u2019re an entrepreneur, know that the best day to raise angel funding is today. The next best day is tomorrow. And so on. Raise what you can now, because when the business cycle changes, the angels will return to heaven.\n\nIn good times, it\u2019s easy to forget that the business cycle is, indeed, a cycle. There are ups and downs. We\u2019re not immune.\u00a0Nor are we immune to macro events, either.\n\nIn the early 1980s, while many other investor categories persevered through the famine of recession, the angels went back to heaven. Then the birth of the personal computer, and record high job and real estate markets in San Francisco, heralded their return.\n\nThen came the recession in the early 1990s. Again, they left\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for a time. After a few years, the \u201cBand of Angels\u201d with \u201cDollars from Heaven\u201d came back faster and stronger. An entire angel ecosystem rapidly expanded as the dot-com bubble grew.\n\nIn 1999, I had been leading a $2 million investment alongside 15 fellow angels from my network. But after the bubble burst in 2000, not one of them was still in the game. I hardly need mention the investment failed.\n\nOf course, as the market started to pick back up, some of my fellow angels and I came back down from heaven. And then in 2007, the real recession arrived.\n\nToday, we\u2019re nine years into a bull market. We can\u2019t know how long it will stay, but we know from past experience that it\u2019s not here to stay forever. And when it does go away, everything in my experience tells me that some angel investors will stick around and many will scatter.\n\nSome say that won\u2019t happen. After all, angels are better entrenched today than ever before. They\u2019re getting better follow-on rates. They\u2019re better organized \u2014\u00a0with hundreds of angel associations. With all that new structural support, this investor class just might be prepared to weather instability.\n\nI\u2019m skeptical. History tells a much different story.

That is, if the network believes a user\u2019s account has been either targeted or already compromised by an attacker working on behalf of a nation-state, Facebook will pop up a notification warning them of the incident and instructing them to turn on \u201cLogin Approvals\u201d \u2013 an additional security mechanism that\u00a0better protects their Facebook account.\n\nWith Login Approvals, users can help prevent others from logging in to their account. After activating this feature, which works somewhat like other two-factor authentication systems, users are alerted when their Facebook account is accessed from a new device or a new web browser. When this occurs, Facebook sends a security code to your phone, so only you \u2013 as the phone\u2019s owner \u2013 will be able to enter in the code and proceed to log in.\n\nIdeally, this extra layer of protection is something that all Facebook users should have turned on by default, but many are not aware the option exists, or they don\u2019t want the hassle of having to go through an extra step when trying to log in from new devices.\n\nExplaining the new warning message, Alex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s Chief Security Officer, notes that the company has always taken steps to secure accounts it suspects to have been compromised, but it has now decided to show this new warning when it believes an attack is government-sponsored.\n\n\u201cWe do this because these types of attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others, and we strongly encourage affected people to take the actions necessary to secure all of their online accounts,\u201d Stamos says.\n\nFacebook will not disclose how it determines an attack to be state-sponsored versus another type of hack, but it says that will only show the message when it has evidence that \u201cstrongly supports\u201d its conclusions. In other words, if you see this message, you will likely need to do more than secure your Facebook account \u2013 it\u2019s possible that your computer could be infected with malware as well, which has allowed the attacker a means of entry in the first place.\n\nFacebook advises that those seeing this new warning message also take steps to rebuild or replace their systems, if necessary.\n\nWhile Google implemented its own system for detecting and warning about state-sponsored attacks back in 2012, it\u2019s not surprising to see Facebook now doing the same. Though the site is primarily a social network, it, too, has communication features including a mailbox you can access on the site as well as an instant messaging program, via Messenger.\n\nUse of these products has increased over the years \u2013 Messenger is regularly the number one\u00a0free app on the App Store, for example. In addition, more activity on Facebook has become private, as well \u2013 like posts in closed Facebook groups where users have to be accepted by an admin in order to read others\u2019\u00a0entries\u00a0and share.\n\nThe decision\u00a0to implement this added security feature is only one of Facebook\u2019s more recent moves to better protect user accounts. Recently, the company rolled out a Security Checkup tool, which also offers login alerts when your account is accessed from a new device or browser. The tool helps users log out of Facebook on unused browsers and apps, too.", "author": "Sarah Perez", "date": "2015-10-19 06:41:25"},

The Autism Glass Project\u2019s software classifies emotions in faces that the device is pointed at, and instantly gives users a read on the face\u2019s expression.\n\nUsing images to translate emotions for children is only the first hurdle to cross, though. The bigger issue the team faced was ensuring the device\u2019s use led to measurable learning when the children were no longer on the device.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want this to be a prosthesis,\u201d emphasized Haber.\n\nIn an effort to understand this off-device learning, the team launched the project\u2019s first phase last year, which involved 40 studies and was conducted in the lab. Initially, the study was constrained because the Wall Lab only had access to one Google Glass device, but this changed when Google donated 35 more devices and the Packard Foundation donated a $379,408 grant to the project in early June this year.\n\nAfter studying the interaction between children and computer screens, the team set out to design a second phase that would allow children to \u201cinteract with their surrounding,\u201d Voss said. The team settled on a game developed by MIT\u2019s Media Lab called \u201cCapture the Smile.\u201d\n\nIn the game, children wear Glass and search for individuals with a specific emotion on their faces. By monitoring performance in this game as well as combining video analysis and questionnaires, \u2018quantitative phenotype\u2019 of Autism can be built for each study participant, providing a mathematical observation of the physical manifestations of their autism.\n\nThe team monitors performance in the game and combines their analysis with video analysis and parental questionnaires to build a \u2018quantitative phenotype\u2019 of Autism for each participant in the study. By tracking this over time, the team can show how their device helps improve emotion recognition over the long term.\n\nThe second phase of the study will last several months, and the Autism Glass Project\u2019s unique technology will allow increased parental involvement in the treatment process.\n\n\u201cYou can start to ask questions, of the percentage of time that the child is talking to his mom, how much is the child looking at her?\u201d said Voss.\n\nAlthough the study only requires children to wear the Google Glass device for three 20-minute periods each day, analyzing what the children are looking at will help the Wall Lab\u2019s researchers develop a better understanding of how visual engagement plays a role in the emotion detection process.\n\nAs massive as the second phase of the project is, it is only the first of many steps for Voss and his team. Wall explained the researchers need to gather clinical data and obtain a code from the American Medical Association before the therapy can become reimbursable, and therefore widespread.\n\nWall hopes that if the technology is validated for widespread clinical use, the team will achieve his goal of widening the bottleneck for autism treatment. Although\u00a0the current study only has 100 participants, future work will allow for the team to improve their software and techniques with an ever-widening data set that will be the first of its kind. The project is accepting applications to join the program through their website starting today.\n\nThough the technology may not be widespread yet, it already has been featured in a book series about an autistic superhero.

Despite the real estate market\u2019 s rapid growth, brokers don\u2019t need licenses or other professional qualifications and many charge excessive fees for basic services. Even searching online classifieds was difficult because most were listed by agents.\n\n\u201cThe experience was very bad and they were not able to help me find what I was looking for. I realized I had absolutely no information about a city or where I was going to stay and that agents were not going to help me out because all they want is a commission,\u201d Shrivastava says.\n\nMotivated by their experiences, Shrivastava and Shukla founded Grabhouse in 2013. The site only accepts listings directly from property owners, who aren\u2019t charged\u00a0unless they close a rental\u00a0through Grabhouse. It is now available in eleven cities and recently closed a $10 million Series B from returning investors Sequoia Capital and Kalaari Capital. Along with a $2.5 million Series A it raised from the same firms just eight months ago and earlier angel funding, the brings Grabhouse\u2019s total venture capital so far to about $13 million.\n\nThe Series B will be used go to build a \u201cvirtual neighborhood specialist,\u201d or online platform that will help Grabhouse scale up by giving users more tools, including property and neighborhood tours. It also plans to launch two new products geared to people looking for shared accommodation.\n\nGrabhouse claims that 2,000 listings go live on its site every day and that it has already closed 50,000 properties. The startup competes with multitude of other sites, like Housing, PropTiger, Commonfloor (all of which have received significant venture backing), but Shrivastava says Grabhouse differentiates by not only focusing on finding properties, but also providing followup services to make it easier to move in, like cleaning, painting, and utilities setup.\n\n\u201cWe want something that is focused on fulfillment, not just discovery and that goes beyond classifieds, so that people go beyond information sharing,\u201d says Shrivastava.\n\nTaking brokers out of the equation\n\n\n\n She adds that the listings on many other real estate sites are provided by brokers. Grabhouse, on the other hand, takes a zero-tolerance approach to real estate agents, which the company claims protects owners and prospective tenants and saves them money. Since there aren\u2019t formal oversights for brokers in India, they vary widely in helpfulness. Shrivastava says brokers often\u00a0act as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d to property information, charging large fees\u2014about 8.3% of annual rent in some cases\u2014solely for access to landlord contact information.\n\nBefore launching, Grabhouse collected public contact information for more than 80,000 real estate brokers and blocked their emails and phone numbers (which are required to create listings) from the site. If agents manage to post listings, users are encouraged to report them.\n\nGrabhouse already operates in eleven of India\u2019s busiest real estate markets, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi. Instead of launching in more places, Shrivastava says it plans to go deeper into each of its current markets.\n\nAll listings, which are checked by Grabhouse before going live, need to include basic data like rent, the property\u2019s condition, commuting options, and a neighborhood profile. Owners also have to say if the location is suitable for single women or families. Shrivastava adds that buildings often refuse to rent to single men, but don\u2019t disclose that information upfront, so Grabhouse requires it in every listing.\n\nThe startup currently monetizes with two models. Its basic option charges a small fee, or 49 rupees (about 75 cents), for a property owner\u2019s contact information. The second costs 999 rupees (about $15) and gets users the assistance of Grabhouse employees called \u201cneighborhood specialists\u201d to help them find listings and arrange move-in services. Shrivastava says Grabhouse rarely hires former real estate agents and instead looks for people who worked in financial services, like credit cards or insurance. Unlike brokers, neighborhood specialists get incentives based on customer satisfaction instead of a percentage of annual rent.\n\nThe neighborhood specialist program performed so well that Grabhouse decided to launch its virtual version. In addition to online tours, the platform will have a calendar so apartment hunters can coordinate in-person tours and other services. The feature is expected to launch in about four to six months. Shrivastava claims this will reduce the number of hours people spend visiting properties.\n\n\u201cThe most exciting thing is working on our virtual neighborhood specialist,\u201d she says. \u201cIt will be groundbreaking for real estate in India and extremely different from anything else out there.\u201d", "author": "Catherine Shu", "date": "2015-10-19 04:29:10"},

It enables corporate, SME, and private bookers to find and book spaces for things like launch events and parties, off-site meetings, workshops or basically any kind of occasion that requires a setting that moves slightly beyond the everyday.\n\n\u201cThe process of trying to book creative, inspiring, off-site spaces is very time consuming and painful. It involves lots of phone calls, emails, filling in forms and contracts and is very paper based,\u201d Andrew Needham, CEO and founder of HeadBox, says when asked to describe the problem the London-based startup solves.\n\n\u201cThe reason for this is the market is currently dominated by traditional venue listing sites who act as a middle-man between the space booker and the space owner. These companies use their websites purely as a lead generator as their business model is based on being an event organiser.\u201d\n\nAiming to \u201cdisrupt\u201d this traditional listings approach, HeadBox can be viewed as a classic online marketplace play, in that it significantly reduces the friction involved for both the space owners wishing to monetise their empty property, and those seeking a creative and inspiring space for short term rental.\n\nTo that end, Needham says that HeadBox cuts out the middle-person (or replaces it, depending on your way of looking at these things) and makes searching, booking and paying for a space easier and quicker, \u201csolving a lot of the current pain points people face when it comes to booking a space for a work related event\u201d.\n\nIn addition, HeadBox is making it easier for hosts to unlock their under-utilised space and drive additional revenue. \u201cThis is opening up a much wider variety of creative and unexpected off-site spaces for Guests to choose from e.g. cool coffee shops, art galleries and bistro pubs to dance and yoga studios, theatres, boats, yachts and many more!\u201d he says.\n\nIn that way the young company is reminiscent of what Appear Here is doing for \u2018pop-up shops\u2019 by matching commercial landlords who have retail space lying empty with brands looking for a short term physical presence on the high street.\n\nMeanwhile, HeadBox is disclosing that it has raised \u00a31.2 million in seed funding.

It launched in Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia in April 2013, but has moved very slowly in Asia, adding just\u00a0the Philippines and Taiwan since then. It\u2019s fair to say that a larger rollout in Asia is long overdue, particularly since Apple Music\u00a0is widely available across the continent.\n\nJapan has been a target of Spotify\u2019s for some time. The company was hiring for a media relations role last year, as Quartz noted, in what was\u00a0a big hint at its plans.\u00a0Spotify confirmed to TechCrunch that it now has a team of four on the ground in Tokyo, while it is currently seeking\u00a0to bolster its rankings with\u00a0a financial controller, per\u00a0a job vacancy.\n\nA source inside Spotify, who declined to be named, told TechCrunch that the hire \u2014 who would be its first financial staffer in Japan \u2014 is an important addition\u00a0given the complexities of music licenses, and the relative nascency of music streaming in Japan \u2014 where CDs still rule for music sales. Keeping an eye on the books and financial flow is all the more important when margins are tighter and pressure is higher.\n\nJapan may be a tricky market but Spotify is already lagging the competition. Line, Japan\u2019s top mobile messaging company, debuted a streaming service in June, and Apple Music then\u00a0entered the country this summer. Spotify isn\u2019t\u00a0just responding to those moves, however. Our source said that while is it ramping up there, the country has long been a focus and Spotify is moving\u00a0cautiously because \u201cmusic licensing is real tough in Japan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to be everywhere in Asia eventually. We\u2019ve had a Japanese team in place for a while but [there\u2019s] no confirmed launch date in the market as yet,\u201d a Spotify spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\nOne launch that will happen sooner, according to our insider, is Indonesia, the Southeast Asian country with a population of more than 250 million and fast growing smartphone sales.\n\nAnother job vacancy at Spotify is a music editor for Indonesia\u00a0[Spotify has since removed the listing], although the role is initially based in\u00a0the company\u2019s Singapore office. A spokesperson told us that the role is aimed at\u00a0localizing the service\u2019s \u2018Browse\u2019 feature for Asia, and the job description shows plenty of playlist curation, content creation\u00a0and more.\n\nBut it clearly paves the way for a local launch, which we understand the company\u00a0is close to doing.\n\nIndonesia\u00a0has emerged as the most promising market for mobile in Southeast Asia, thanks to the continued growth of smartphone sales \u2014 up\u00a055 percent over the past year \u2014 and increasing adoption of mobile Internet. While the average digital spend per user is well below that of Japan, the U.S. or Europe, the potential is there for\u00a0Southeast Asia to be a mobile-first region. (Spotify now sees more than half of its activity on mobile.) Signs of business and revenue promise in\u00a0Indonesia come from the e-commerce space. Rocket Internet\u2019s Lazada, Mattahari Mall, a local outfit backed by $500 million, and Tokopedia, an Alibaba like service backed by SoftBank\u00a0are\u00a0all focused on cracking the country.\n\nIn terms of rivals, Indonesian music streaming fans can tune into Rdio, Deezer, the French firm that plans to raise $345 million via an IPO\u00a0this month, MixRadio \u2014 which Line bought from Microsoft\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Australia\u2019s Guvera\u00a0and Apple Music.\n\nFinally, Spotify is also hiring a APAC Label Traffic Manager\u00a0who\u00a0will \u201chelp to ensure that all ad campaigns run smoothly for our label partners\u201d across the region. (Spotify is also live in Australia and New Zealand, which are part of the APAC region.) This role doesn\u2019t hint at new launches, but the fact that the company is being more organized in its approach to label relations and performance in Asia, and Asia Pacific,\u00a0shows the region is a greater priority.\n\nDespite the moves, there\u2019s no word on when the service will come to India, a market that is tipped to become as important for mobile as China and India.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely want to make Spotify available in India as we do across the rest of Asia, but there\u2019s nothing to report as of now,\u201d a Spotify spokesperson told TechCrunch back in May of this year. Since there\u2019s no further update, India-based Spotify fans will need to use a VPN or create overseas account until the Swedish company makes its move.", "author": "Jon Russell", "date": "2015-10-19 01:45:58"},

Even though the company seems to be pushing the 5X heavily with television commercials and consumer-friendly speak, it might not be the Android that you\u2019re looking for.\n\nLG and Google have worked together again to bring you their latest Nexus incarnation. The Nexus 5X, one of two new flagship phones from Google, is being described fondly by the company as \u201cthe all-around champ.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what that means. Also, they\u2019re saying things like the 5X is \u201ccapturing the soul of the Nexus family.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what that means, either.\n\nWhat I do know is that this is the counterpart to Apple\u2019s iPhone 6S, if you will. It\u2019s around the same screen size, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s getting that comparison. While that form factor and size is popular, the 5X doesn\u2019t seem to cash in on the promise of a \u201ctop tier\u201d device. It\u2019s plastic. And feels like it. It\u2019s light. But too light. It starts at $379 and is available on the Google Play Store.\n\nThe Nexus 5X sports a 5.2 inch, FHD (1920 x 1080) LCD at 423 ppi screen. It has rock-solid Gorilla Glass 3 and that \u201cfingerprint and smudge-resistant oleophobic coating\u201d that I want to be a real thing. In my testing so far, of both devices, shows that there\u2019s plenty of fingerprints and smudges. So we\u2019ll have to have a chat with Google about that. The rear camera is the same 12.3 mexapixel one with 1.55 \u03bcm pixels and f/2.0 aperture that the 6P has. It shoots gorgeous 4K video. Google did the right thing by having LG and Huawai on the same page for cameras. It\u2019s a real powerhouse. The front-facing camera is an OK 5 megapixels. Not horrible, but if you\u2019re a selfie-machine, look elsewhere.\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor along with the 2 GB of RAM keeps the phone running quickly, helped by Android\u2019s Marshmallow operating system. It\u2019s available in 16 or 32GB for storage, but not 64 or 128 like the 6P is. So yeah, the 16GB model would be the closest to the iPhone 6S base model. At 136 grams, it\u2019s light. It also comes in black, white and blue\u2026.or \u201cCarbon, Quartz, Ice.\u201d\n\nThe sound that comes out of the single speaker in the front is nothing to write home about, but gets the job done. The 2700 mAh battery gave me about almost a full-day use\u2026but not quite. Luckily, Google has adopted the USB Type-C system, so you can go from basically no battery to 20% in minutes. It\u2019s quite impressive.\n\nI picked up the 5X at last month\u2019s event and thought \u201cWow, this is really light.\u201d Before I got to spend real time with both the 5X and 6P, I thought that this was going to be the device that drags me away from the iPhone 6. Not the case.\n\nThe more time I held it in my hand, the cheaper it felt. I\u2019ve tried out a boatload of devices and being light is a good thing\u2026but feeling like cheap plastic totally turns me off. Google and LG calls it \u201cpremium injection molded polycarbonate,\u201d but that\u2019s not changing my mind.\n\nI haven\u2019t carried it enough to actually drop it, but I do feel like it\u2019s going to fly out of my hand. The phone looks great, but everyone that I\u2019ve asked to pick it up says the same damn thing. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel like a great phone.\u201d That sucks, because Google wants this to be the phone that takes you away from iOS, Windows, Blackberry or whatever else phone you have.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I put a Speck case designed specifically for the 5X on it and while that gave it a bit more heft and grip, it wasn\u2019t much.\n\nOther than it being ridonculously light, the screen just isn\u2019t as bright as the 6P. Sure, for obvious reasons. It also doesn\u2019t stand up to what I\u2019ve become accustomed to on the iPhone 6. Speaking of the iPhone, it\u2019s fingerprint sensor is embedded in the home button. I thought that was cool until I saw the new Nexus phones. Google decided to put the fingerprint sensor on the back, right under the camera. Once you hold it, it makes complete sense\u2026because that\u2019s how you take your phone out of your pocket and hold it.\n\nGenius design. Plus, the unlock process is so fast, I barely ever see the lock screen. It\u2019s unlocked by the time I grab it in whatever pocket I have it in. Super awesome touch.\n\nOhhhhh, the camera. It was clearly a point of focus for Google this year. Its Google Photos product is as good as it gets for managing photos, so it\u2019s great that their flagship devices sport incredible cameras.\n\nI carry around a DSLR sometimes, and have never thought of my iPhone 6 as a suitable replacement for it. The Nexus camera at over 12 megapixels? Crisp, clear pictures that rival those of my DSLR. The front-facing camera isn\u2019t going to make selfie-takers happy. The 5 megapixels seems like a not-so-smart skimp to keep the cost down. If you\u2019re going to make the rear camera standard between the two manufacturers, why not the front one?\n\nMarshmallow was built to run on these devices and vice versa. The great part about picking up a Nexus device is that you\u2019re always going to have the latest and greatest version of Android. That alone might make you want to pick up this phone.\n\nAll of Google\u2019s stuff comes pre-installed, which is fine because if you\u2019re buying this device, you want a \u201cGoogle Phone.\u201d That\u2019s what this is. After you fire this badboy up, you\u2019ll have to update all of the Google apps, which takes a while. It\u2019s usable out of the box of course, but not advised. Just let it all update.\n\nWhen you want to perform a search, you can pretty much do it from every screen on the phone. Whether it\u2019s by shouting out \u201cOK, Google\u201d or using the browser, the Nexus 5X gets you to information-finding mode fast.\n\nThe newest feature that takes advantage of everything Google has to offer is \u201cGoogle Now On Tap.\u201d The premise is simple. If you\u2019re talking to your friend on Facebook Messenger or Google Hangouts, and you mention that you\u2019d like to grab a drink, you can hold the home button for a few seconds and get information that\u2019s in the context of what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nFor the example of grabbing a drink, Google will bring back bars that are close to you or suggested drinks based on your liking. I tend to get those because I look up the recipes of drinks a lot.\n\nI\u2019m not going to say that the Nexus 5X is a bad phone, because it\u2019s not. If you\u2019re set on having its screen size and are dead-set against going bigger with the 6P, I\u2019d suggest going after the latest Samsung Edge phone. Of course, you\u2019ll be paying a few hundred extra bucks and losing the flexibility of having an unlocked phone like the 5X.\n\nIf money matters, which hey\u2026for devices that are upgraded every year, it should be, the 5X is perfectly serviceable. The previous LG Nexus, the 5, was a much better jump for the Nexus line than this one is.\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t do it for me and I\u2019m gravitating towards the larger 6P, which I\u2019ve also reviewed. Now mind you, we only got about four days to spend with the phones so far, so if anything changes we\u2019ll be sure to let you know. Maybe one of these will pull me away from my iPhone 6. The 5X? Unlikely for me, it\u2019s just too \u201clight\u201d for me.\n\nIf you buy this phone, definitely get Google\u2019s new \u201cNexus Protect,\u201d their version of Apple Care. It\u2019ll run you $69. You\u2019re probably going to break it if you take it out of your pocket more than 10 times a day. It reminds me of the HTC \u201cFacebook phone\u201d which I completely wrecked after less than a week. Now that phone was flimsy.\n\nI really really hope that Google starts building its own phones moving forward. While I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s a cost saving and convenience (among other things) that comes with working with a company like LG, the simple fact that the review for these devices are so different tells you something. You could easily cover up or take off the hardware manufacturer name on the back of the 5X and 6P and someone on the street would be able to tell that it made by two different companies. That\u2019s a real problem and it\u2019s time to own this flagship line, Google. The 5X definitely suffered a bit due to the current strategy.", "author": "Drew Olanoff", "date": "2015-10-19 01:00:26"},

Let\u2019s get some of the more important ones out of the way:\n\nDisplay\n\n The screen is crystal clear. Beautiful, really. It\u2019s 5.7 inches, WQHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display, Gorilla Glass 4, and sports something Google calls \u201cfingerprint and smudge-resistant oleophobic coating.\u201d Welp. It definitely sounds fancy, but my screen picks up plenty of fingerprints and smudges. Maybe my fingers are oleophobic-penetrating.\n\nCameras\n\n Oh, the cameras. The rear camera is 12.3 megapixels, has IR laser-assisted autofocus, and shoots 4K video at 30 frames per second. The flash is also great, not washing out your photo subjects. The front-facing camera is 8 megapixels and shoots a pretty decent HD video.\n\nProcessors, memory and storage\n\n This baby is fast. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 process and gets some help from 3GB of speedy LPDDR4 RAM. You can pick it up in 32, 64 or 128GB. No 16GB version, which is interesting since this is a size that Apple just won\u2019t give up on yet.\n\nEverything else\n\n It\u2019s anodized aluminum, which feels great to the touch. The dual front-facing stereo speaker is pretty great, letting you listen to music or videos from across the room. It has three microphones in total, front and back, all with noise cancellation. Making video, voice or VOIP calls sound pretty great.\n\nThe battery is outstanding thus far and I\u2019ve gotten through an entire day of regular use without having to charge. When it is time to charge, you can do so quicker than ever with the USB Type-C system. Sure you\u2019ll have new plugs to carry around, but you can go from about a 5 percent charged to 20 percent in minutes.\n\nSince the phone spends most of its time in your hand, at least for me, how it feels physically is extremely important. The Nexus 6P is notably heavy (178 grams), but lighter than the Nexus 6 that hit the streets last year. Our own Greg Kumparak referred to that device as \u201ccumbersome.\u201d While I feel like the 6P\u2019s \u201cheft\u201d could turn some folks off, I wouldn\u2019t call it a roadblock.\n\nI\u2019ve only had the device for about four days, so take some of this with a grain of salt. I\u2019ll be doing a follow-up in a few weeks to share whether I was able to switch to this phone from my trusty iPhone 6. Having said that, I did notice some fatigue in my wrist after using the 6P for two days. Over the next two days that fatigue started to go away as I got used to the new size and form factor.\n\nWhat I\u2019m missing is the softer back that the Nexus 6 introduced last year. It was handy when I was on a plane or train ride and would use my phone for upwards of an hour at a time. I have no idea why they\u2019d take something like that away, but perhaps Google didn\u2019t get the same feedback that I have. I always heard that the soft back was a plus from friends and colleagues. Oh well, a case can easily fix that. For short spurts of regular use, I ditch the case and show off the pretty phone anyways.\n\nThe larger screen size does lend itself to more two-handed usage than say the Nexus 5X or iPhone 6S. Again, that\u2019s OK if you\u2019re willing to be open-minded to trying a larger phone. The quality of what\u2019s showing up on the screen more than makes up for getting used to holding it differently.\n\nI never thought I\u2019d care about a fingerprint sensor, but hot damn did Google get this design right. The new Nexus phones both sport the fingerprint sensor on the rear, under the camera. It\u2019s way more natural than the home button on iOS devices, in my opinion. When you take your phone out of your pocket you naturally touch the exact spot. Very smart. It\u2019s super fast to unlock, too. Most of the time, I don\u2019t even see the lock screen. I haven\u2019t had one issue with it, it just works.\n\nColor-wise you have a choice between aluminum, graphite and frost. I lean toward the darker colors, but it\u2019s a personal call. I saw all three at the event and wasn\u2019t put off by it. Plus, with the gorgeous metal finish, you can\u2019t really go wrong. On the other hand, the 5X looks like cheap plastic no matter which color you choose.\n\nGoogle decided that this year\u2019s Nexus line was going to go all out when it comes to the camera. The 5X and 6P share the same rear-facing camera and it takes professional-grade photos. Lotsa megapixels and ridiculously fast shutter speeds.", "author": "Drew Olanoff", "date": "2015-10-19 01:00:08"},

Considering that only five percent of the city\u2019s high school students are even enrolled in any computer science classes, San Francisco Unified provides a startling contrast with how the city has become geographic center of the U.S. technology industry over the last five years.\n\nSo a San Francisco parent, Tyson Daugherty stepped in. Looking to bridge the city\u2019s school system with the wealth of opportunities of the tech industry all around it, he started MissionBit to bring free after-school computer science education to public school students.\n\nOver the past year, the non-profit has matured. Daugherty has handed over the reins to Stevon Cook, a third-generation, black San Franciscan who grew up in Bayview and ran for school board last year.\n\nCook has since re-organized MissionBit to bring more students of color into its classes. Today, 23 percent of its students are African American, 25 percent are Latino and 40 percent speak a language other than English at home. For nine out of 10 of them, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve ever written code before.\n\n\u201cWhat Tyson saw in me was someone who had deep roots in the San Francisco community \u2014 someone who really cares about expanding the opportunity,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe are going out into the farthest places in San Francisco where you\u2019d never think of seeing a coding class.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, MissionBit is teaching a daytime class at Leadership High School in Excelsior on top of the after school programs (pictured above).\n\nWhen I visited, 15-year-old CJ Carter was building a Zombie apocalypse-themed game. \u201cEverything is so complicated! There\u2019s so much code, like lines and lines,\u201d he told me.\n\nHe and his partner, 15-year-old Esteban Colon, were trying to build the pre-loading screen and the main menu.\n\nCook is also re-organizing MissionBit to be more self-sustaining by having the schools and the district chip in funding for the classes. San Francisco Unified recently passed a resolution to expand computer science education to all grades from pre-school through 12th. But it will take several years given budgetary constraints; California is in the lower half of the rankings for statewide education spending per student. He has a three-year goal of teaching 10,000 students through workshops and courses in campuses and across the entire Bay Area region.\n\nNext up, Cook is also building a six-month programming course for the city\u2019s public housing residents in\u00a0partnership with Hack Reactor.\n\n\u201cIf you can give people the skills to stay in the city and take advantage of all it has to offer, they can escape that generational trap,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWhen young people get experiences like this, their whole perception of self and their sense of agency is changed. We need to build schools that achieve these things and that help people and their communities advance so they can work for whatever company they want to.\u201d\n\nFor Cook, it\u2019s a personal mission. His grandparents came to San Francisco in the 1940s. Like other African-Americans, they were not allowed to buy property anywhere outside of a tiny number of San Francisco neighborhoods because of discriminatory housing policies that barred blacks from purchasing homes in primarily white neighborhoods and suburbs in mid-20th century California.\n\nThey ended up living in Bayview. Cook\u2019s grandfather took a job in the shipyards while his grandmother was an admin at the city\u2019s public hospital, the San Francisco General.\n\n\u201cChanged Everything for Me\u201d \u2013 A Mission Bit short film from Mission Bit on Vimeo.\n\nToday, the African-American population in San Francisco has rapidly declined over the last generation, falling to 5.8 percent from 13.4 percent in 1970. There is even a documentary being made about the shift, called \u201cThe Last Black Man in San Francisco\u201d by Joe Talbot and Jimmie Fails.\n\nEven with record employment growth amid an enormous tech boom, the median income of African-Americans in the city has declined by 5 percent to $29,500. Over the years, Cook has watched his friends and community, which remain in physically isolated neighborhoods and housing developments, get sidelined as the city\u2019s wealth has increased.\n\n\u201cIf we can give people better educational and work opportunities and give them possibilities to move up within companies, all of this is worth getting someone out of the projects,\u201d Cook said of his upcoming public housing computer science program. \u201cWhen you see all of the negative social and emotional risk factors associated with living in those units, you\u2019ll see poorer educational outcomes and higher risks for health issues.\u201d\n\nGetting those educational opportunities means overcoming huge discrepancies in access that exist even in the wealthiest of cities like San Francisco. Last year, only 800 kids out of 17,000 high school students were enrolled in computer science classes.\n\nOn top of that, no African-American students in the San Francisco\u2019s public high schools\u00a0took the computer science AP test last year, which is embarrassing\u00a0considering\u00a0that the percentage was higher\u00a0among both\u00a0state and federal test-takers.\n\nCook is running MissionBit on a $400,000 annual budget for\u00a0five lead instructors, computers and equipment. He needs to raise $40,000 by the end of the year minimum in order to keep the program going and is hoping to get to $100,000.\n\nAlready, Cook and Daugherty\u00a0have\u00a0a couple of well-connected tech leaders on\u00a0the board like Clive Downie, the chief marketing officer of Unity\u00a0Technologies. Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger also spoke at the non-profit\u2019s annual fundraiser.\n\nBut they still need more funding to keep the non-profit going and they also are looking for volunteer instructors who can commit at least four hours a month to teaching.\u00a0The classes, which run up to three months, are project-based. So\u00a0they don\u2019t prefer\u00a0drop-in volunteers; they need folks who are willing to\u00a0commit\u00a0and help the kids complete projects that will be ready by Demo Day.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this wealth will come into the city no matter what and it will do what it will do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are certain things we can do that we can put in place for people who are poor so they can access it.\u201d", "author": "Kim-Mai Cutler", "date": "2015-10-18 09:00:57"},

To survive, hospitals, clinics and doctors\u2019 offices will need to completely re-engineer their operations, creating a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity for startups that can deliver systems and tools that help the healthcare industry make the transition.\n\nBut time is short, the technologies are unproven and the stakes are immense; there will be no second chances for startups that don\u2019t get it right the first time.\n\nBy adopting fixed bundled payments for \u201cepisodes of care,\u201d the Obama administration aims to incentivize hospitals, physicians and other medical services providers to work together to provide patients with more effective and efficient care, as well as find better ways to help them recover successfully.\n\nUnder current practices, the average Medicare expenditure for surgery, hospitalization and recovery ranges from $16,500 to $33,000 across geographic areas. But average costs fly out the window when post-surgery complications require readmissions to hospitals or extended rehabilitative care. Medicare assumes these additional costs, as well.\n\nIn January, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will start moving to bundled payments for knee and hip replacements, some of the most common surgeries that Medicare beneficiaries receive, with other procedures expected to follow.\n\nUnder this new model, CMS will reimburse medical providers a fixed amount (estimates suggest around $25,000) for each knee or hip surgery, and medical providers are responsible for any costs that exceed the reimbursed amount. This is known as \u201cbreaking the bundle,\u201d and with some knee and hip surgeries running as high as $125,000, it would not take many bundle-breaking patients to bankrupt small- or medium-sized clinics or hospitals.\n\nMedical providers will be under tremendous pressure to make the transition from fee-for-service to bundled payments, giving startups an 18-month window of opportunity to prove their technology works. If they fail, healthcare IT leaders like McKesson and TriZetto will have a chance to retool and retain their grip on the market.\n\nThree key areas of opportunity stand out:\n\nRevenue Cycle Management and Payment Systems.\u00a0Startups like\u00a0Remedy Partners\u00a0are leveraging data analytics to give medical providers the clinical and financial insights they need to design successful bundled payment programs.\n\nAnother important challenge will be to develop software that tracks contributions and distributes payment among the various providers\u00a0\u2014 hospitals, doctors, imaging services, laboratories and rehab therapists\u00a0\u2014 that contribute to a single episode, or outcome. Even more contentious will be assessing which service provider is responsible when costs exceed the reimbursed amount.\n\nRemote Care Technologies.\u00a0Health care providers can dramatically lower costs by better coordinating care between providers and keeping patients out of the doctor\u2019s office or hospital in the first place. Startups such as\u00a0Patient IO\u00a0help medical providers create personalized mobile care plans that can be delivered to patients outside the clinic.\n\nOthers are developing new tools to guide post-op patients through physical therapy and other rehabilitation programs. For example, one researcher at University College Dublin has developed an app that turns a mobile phone into a rehabilitation tool that provides real-time feedback on rehab exercises and activities.\n\nPatient Selection Software.\u00a0Much has been written about how big data can be used to predict which hospitalized patients are most likely to suffer complications or relapses. With the push toward bundled payments, medical providers will increasingly want to know which patients are safe bets and which ones are considered high risk to\u00a0break the bundle.\n\nFor example, under the current fee for service system, there is no penalty to the hospital or surgeon when a patient is actually a poor candidate for the surgery being performed. Under a bundled payment system, providers are going to need to have much more sophisticated tools to discern who may be a risk to break the bundle before offering surgery. While there certainly are moral issues to be debated here, it is clear the medical community needs to understand its exposure if it is expected to assume the financial risks.\n\nDozens of startups have anticipated this opportunity, but with the first bundle payments set for January, the moment of truth is arriving more quickly than expected. While some of these startups can tout financial management software built for the bundled payment model, none of it has been tested in real-world conditions. And not one of these startups has yet designed software that medical providers need to analyze and optimize the delivery of clinical care.

And, considering Android Pay\u2019s recent unveiling, it seems that its competitors are, as well. So, as we prepare to celebrate, the question is:\u00a0How are things going?\n\nMore Competition Is Good News.\u00a0Some might consider events like Google Wallet completing its transformation to Android Pay and Samsung throwing its hat into the mobile payments ring to be bad news for the months\u2019-old Apple Pay. But it\u2019s actually great news.\n\nMore major players placing bets on the wallet\u2019s extinction will turn up the heat on merchants to add payment terminals that support the technology and expedite consumer education. With the necessary infrastructure in place, Apple can simply rely on the popularity of its phones to do the rest. How are Blackberry and the Microsoft Zune doing, by the way?\n\nNew iPhone Sales Cycle.\u00a0Last October, when Apple Pay was released, only about 12 percent of iPhone users had models compatible with the service. That figure has increased to roughly 47 percent, and is expected to continue spiking thanks to the September 25 release of the iPhone 6s and the company\u2019s newly unveiled upgrade incentives that promise to maximize 6-series penetration.\u00a0More people possessing the ability to use Apple Pay obviously is good news.\n\nLaying The Foundation For Micro-Merchant Adoption Growth.\u00a0Commerce has become increasingly populist in recent years, as the ubiquity of intuitive technology and a recession-fueled entrepreneurship bubble have combined to create a new breed of single-person, smartphone-based businesses.\n\nApple\u2019s recently announced partnership with PayAnywhere to create a mobile card reader that supports contactless payments reflects the company\u2019s recognition of this important trend, and infuses a dose of competition into the space. Square also is expected to release an Apple Pay-compatible reader shortly after Apple\u2019s version.\u00a0Having more of these readers on the streets, no matter who makes them, will reduce barriers to Apple Pay adoption.\n\nMore Card Issuers Participating.\u00a0In recent months, Apple has announced a steady stream of new banks and credit unions that will support Apple Pay: 59 in May, 12 in June, 35 in July and 64 in August. Now, Apple Pay has more than 400 financial institution partners overall. Some\u00a0\u2014 including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Capital One\u00a0\u2014 are even doing the product\u2019s advertising for it. None of that is bad news.\n\n\u201cStrong\u201d Initial Adoption.\u00a0The extent to which customers have taken to Apple Pay depends on who you ask. If it\u2019s Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard, he\u2019ll tell you that, \u201cWe are seeing strong uptake. But these technologies will take time to grow.\u201d Considering that MasterCard accounts for 23 percent of the credit card market\u2019s purchase volume and 30 percent when it comes to debit cards, this is an opinion that merits attention.\n\nUsers Can\u2019t Keep It Up.\u00a0As everyday consumers have joined early adopters in enjoying Apple Pay access, usage rates have declined. The share of iPhone 6 users who say they use Apple Pay \u201cevery chance I get\u201d has fallen from 48 percent in March to 33 percent in June, according to surveys by InfoScout and PYMNTS.com. What\u2019s more, the percentage of people who say they \u201crarely consider\u201d using Apple Pay increased from 17 percent to 23 percent over that same time period.\n\nSome may ascribe this to the natural rhythms of a product launch, but a continuation of this brief trend would undoubtedly lead to more fervent calls for alarm.\n\nBig-Name Merchant Hold-Outs.\u00a0There\u2019s an interesting competitive dynamic emerging in the mobile payments space. While most of Apple Pay\u2019s competitors are welcome, because they bring infrastructure that Apple Pay can leverage, CurrentC is a problematic exception. Why?\u00a0Because it\u2019s backed by the likes of Walmart, Best Buy, CVS and Lowe\u2019s \u2014 retail titans that are exercising their power to throw a wrench into Apple Pay adoption for millions of iPhone users by not accepting it in their stores. Simply having to think about whether or not you can use your phone as payment at a given store keeps physical wallets in the game.\n\nLittle European Penetration: The European Central Bank Credit caps debit and credit card interchange fees \u2014 payments made by card issuers to card networks for facilitating electronic purchases \u2014 at roughly 0.5 percent. When you consider that Apple Pay charges 0.15 percent of each transaction, it\u2019s clear why there are concerns among the traditional parties as to whether they will get their fill.\n\nTo be fair, Apple Pay has been embraced in many respects across the pond. In the U.K., for example, you can use the service to pay for public transportation. But something has to give in the interchange fee battle before Apple Pay can truly take off on the continent.\n\nThe Fundamental Problem Still Remains:\u00a0The absolute biggest roadblock facing Apple Pay and its mobile payment brethren has yet to be overcome. If we do away with our wallets in favor of our phones, our ability to pay for things is still at the mercy of the battery. And, considering how often most of us find ourselves out and about without a charge, especially when unforeseen events come into play, this is still a far too risky gamble to make. As long as people need physical credit cards, debit cards, etc., as backup, Apple Pay\u2019s ultimate vision cannot be realized.\n\nApple Pay may be the biggest trailblazer in the space, but it certainly doesn\u2019t have a mobile payments monopoly. So, to truly understand the product\u2019s position in the market, one must consider it within the context of its competitors. The table below compares the most promising mobile wallets based on factors essential to consumer adoption and long-term success.\n\nApple Pay has a few notable weaknesses, but they are ultimately overshadowed by its many significant strengths.\u00a0And while it might not end up dominating the market to quite the same extent as iPhones do, it\u2019s certainly clear that Apple Pay is here to stay.\n\nMobile payment technology appears to be a tide capable of lifting at least a few of the best-positioned boats, after all. In-store mobile payments are expected to post a 1,000 percent\u00a0year-over-year increase in 2015, according to Deloitte, with Juniper Research projecting a 100 percent increase for mobile payments overall from 2015 through 2016.", "author": "Odysseas Papadimitriou", "date": "2015-10-17 08:00:14"},

No longer just the domain of sci-fi fans, nerds or Google engineers, I hear people discussing AI at parties, coffee shops and even at the dinner table: My five-year-old daughter brought it up the other night over taco lasagna. When I asked her if anything interesting had happened in school, she replied that her teacher discussed smart robots.\n\nThe exploration of intelligence \u2014 be it human or artificial \u2014 is ultimately the domain of epistemology, the study of knowledge. Since the first musings of creating AI back in antiquity, epistemology seems to have led the debate on how to do it. The question I hear most in this field from the public is: How can humans develop another intelligent consciousness if we can\u2019t even understand our own?\n\nIt\u2019s a prudent question. The human brain, despite being only about 3 pounds in weight, is the least understood organ in the body. And with a billion neurons \u2014 with 100 trillion connections \u2014 it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s going to be a long time before we end up figuring out the brain.\n\nGenerally, scientists believe human consciousness is a compilation of many chemicals in the brain forced though a prism that produces cognitive awareness designed to insist an entity is aware of not only itself but also the outside world.\n\nSome people argue that the quintessential key to consciousness is awareness. French philosopher and mathematician Ren\u00e9 Descartes may have made the initial step by saying\u00a0I think, therefore I am. But thinking does not adequately define consciousness. Justifying thinking is much closer to the meaning that\u2019s adequate. It really should be:\u00a0I believe I\u2019m conscious, therefore I am.\n\nBut even awareness doesn\u2019t ring right with me when searching for a grand theory of consciousness. We can teach a robot all day to insist it is aware, but we can\u2019t teach it to prove it\u2019s not a brain in a vat \u2014 something people still can\u2019t do either.\n\nChristof Koch, chief neuroscientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, offers a more unique and holistic version of consciousness. He thinks consciousness can happen in any complex processing system, including animals, worms and possibly even the Internet.\n\nIn an interview, when asked what consciousness is, Koch replied,\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a theory, called Integrated Information Theory, developed by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin, that assigns to any one brain, or any complex system, a number \u2014\u00a0denoted by the Greek symbol\u00a0\u03a6\u00a0\u2014 that tells you how integrated a system is, how much more the system is than the union of its parts. \u03a6 gives you\u00a0an information-theoretical measure of consciousness. Any system with integrated information different from zero has consciousness. Any integration\u00a0feels like something.\u201d\n\nIf Koch and Tononi are correct, then it would be a mistake to ever think one conscious could equal another. It would be apples and oranges. Just like no snowflake or planet is the same as another, we must be on our guard against using anthropomorphic prejudice when thinking about consciousness.\n\nIn this way, the first autonomous super-intelligence we create via machines may think and behave dramatically different than us \u2014 so much so that it may not ever relate to us, or vice versa. In fact, every AI we ever create in the future may leave us in very short order for distant parts of the digital universe \u2014 an ego-thumping concept made visual in the brilliant movie Her.\u00a0Of course, an AI might just terminate itself, too, upon realizing it\u2019s alive and surrounded by curious humans peering at it.\n\nWhatever happens, in the same way there is the anthropological concept cultural relativism, we must be ready for consciousness relativism \u2014 the idea that one consciousness may be totally different than another, despite the hope that math, logic and coding will be obvious communication tools.\n\nThis makes even more sense when you consider how small-minded humans and their consciousness might actually be. After all, nearly all our perception comes from our five senses, which is how our brain makes sense of the world. And every one of our senses is quite poor in terms of possible ability. The eye, for example, only sees about 1 percent of the universe\u2019s light spectrum.\n\nFor this reason, I\u2019m reluctant to insist on consciousness being one thing or the other, and do lean toward believing Koch and Tononi are correct by saying variations of consciousness can be seen in many forms across the spectrum of existence.\n\nThis also reinforces why I\u2019m reluctant to believe that AI will fundamentally be like us. I surmise it may learn to replicate our behavior \u2014 perhaps even perfectly \u2014 but it will always be something different. Replication is no different than the behavior of a wind-up doll. Most humans hope for much more of themselves and their consciousness. And, of course, most AI engineers want much more for the machines they hope to give a conscious rise to.\n\nDespite that, we will still try to create AI with our own values and ways of thinking, including imbuing it with traits we posses. If I had to pinpoint one behavioral trait of consciousness that humans all have and should also be instilled in AI, it would be empathy. It\u2019s empathy that will form the type of AI\u00a0consciousness the world wants and needs \u2014 and one that people also can understand and accept.\n\nOn the other hand, if a created consciousness can empathize, then it must also be able to like or dislike \u2014 and even to love or hate something.\n\nTherein lies the conundrum. In order for a consciousness to make judgments on value, both liking and disliking (love and hate) functions must be part of the system. No one minds thinking about AI\u2019s that can love \u2014 but super-intelligent machines that can hate? Or feel sad? Or feel guilt? That\u2019s much more controversial \u2014 especially in the drone age where machines control\u00a0autonomous weaponry. And yet, anything less than that coding in empathy to an intelligence just creates a follower machine \u2014 a wind-up doll consciousness.\n\nKevin LaGrandeur,\u00a0a professor at the New York Institute of Technology, recently wrote, \u201cIf a machine could truly be made to \u2018feel\u2019 guilt in its varying degrees, then would we have problems of machine suffering and machine \u2018suicide\u2019\u201d? If we develop a truly strong artificial intelligence,\u00a0we might \u2014\u00a0and then we would face the moral problem of creating a suffering being.\n\nIt\u2019s a pickle for sure. I don\u2019t envy the programmers who are endeavoring to bring a super intelligence into our world, knowing that their creations may also consciously hate things \u2014 including its creators. Such programming may just lead to a world where robots and machine intelligences experience the same modern-day problems \u2014 angst, bigotry, depression, loneliness and rage \u2014 afflicting humanity.", "author": "Zoltan Istvan", "date": "2015-10-17 03:00:20"},

However, Scoot\u2019s VP Mike Waltman told me that\u2019s just the beginning.\n\nThe Quad is a bit of an experiment for both Scoot and Nissan. \u201cAs large cities continue to grow into megacities globally, we need to understand how transportation is changing and look ahead to anticipate what transportation needs will look like in the future,\u201d Nissan Future Lab executive director Rachel Nguyen said.\n\nNissan is familiar with the electric vehicle market \u2013 introducing Nissan LEAF to San Francisco orginally in 2010.

Even systems that are supposed to work together don\u2019t do so easily, such as the Apple TV and just about any output device.\n\nWe need a digital age of enlightenment and openness to unleash the full potential of the\u00a0IoT. This means standardizing cross-device and multi-platform communication, and building user interfaces that are easy to use.\n\nIf technology vendors won\u2019t come together to enable better integration between devices in the home, maybe something as drastic as the current drought in California will motivate them.\n\nWitness the burst of innovation as companies scramble to help farmers, municipalities and consumers save precious water. This is a scenario in which big data, automation and smart technology can not only impact lifestyle and convenience, but also affect economics and sustainability. If ever there was a time for IoT vendors to come together and adopt standards, this is it.\n\nCalifornia is in its fourth consecutive year of drought, and the state of emergency has led to a rush to market in the agricultural technology space. Old-school companies like John Deere have added sensors to their equipment to help farmers plan where and when to plant. Intel is helping the University of California, Santa Barbara measure snow patterns in the Sierra Nevada mountains. IBM is using sensors and AT&T\u2019s LTE wireless network to warn cities about leaks in underground pipes and drainage systems.\n\nAs a result, the agtech funding floodgates are wide open. The first half of 2015 saw 228 venture capital deals, worth $2.06 billion \u2014 nearly reaching the record $2.36 billion invested in all of 2014, according to AgFunder News. Of the recent deals, $525 million involved water-oriented startups. Companies like CropX and OnFarm offer smart irrigation technology, using sensors to prescribe water delivery that optimizes crop yield while saving water.\n\nThese companies are ambitious, and are taking their cues from the biggest players in technology. \u201cWe want to be the Apple of agriculture, in terms of sleek software and hardware integration,\u201d says CropX CEO Isaac Bentwich. \u201cAnd to be the Google of agriculture in dealing with the massive flow of information that comes from the Internet of Things.\u201d\n\nThe more connected devices, the higher quality the data and the more effective the overall system. Scale isn\u2019t a problem: The number of connected devices is estimated at five billion, and is projected to grow to 25 billion by 2020, according to Gartner. We\u2019ve got a growing number of smart devices, from alarm systems and washing machines to wearable personal safety devices and contact lenses that measure glucose levels. Outside the home, there\u2019s a big push for the IoT in healthcare, which is projected to be a $117 billion market by 2020, says MarketResearch.com.\n\nThe next wave for the IoT will be enabling communication between devices and systems, and taking a more open-source view into the data collected. The real promise is in closing the data loop and using that information to trigger actions.\n\nTo enable this, we\u2019ve got to release the data from their current silos and standardize on networking protocols. Currently, developers must choose from a number of platforms, networking choices and other protocols: Google\u2019s Brillo, Apple\u2019s HomeKit, ZigBee, iBeacon, AllJoyn, Bluetooth Low Energy, 6LoWPAN and RFID, to name a few.\n\nWithout standards, devices aren\u2019t speaking to each other, and information isn\u2019t cross-pollinating. As a result, our \u201csmart\u201d systems lack contextual understanding. Lawn watering systems, for example, should activate home sprinklers based on temperature and precipitation data from home thermostats and weather apps. In the absence of this data sharing, we\u2019re left running outside in the middle of the night to turn off the sprinklers. We have a universal remote for the IoT \u2014 there are two billion smartphone users in the world, after all \u2014 but interoperability remains unresolved.\n\nThe IoT won\u2019t be the rainmaker in California, but it can help us better manage our water when it comes. The drought might be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back on IoT standards. We have the investment, innovation and urgency to catalyze a major shift.

Its 12 month Entrepreneurs-in-Training (EIT) program infuses African techies with \u201ca combination of hard IT and practical business skills to equip them to build successful commercial tech companies,\u201d says MEST Managing Director Neal Hansch.\n\nSome EIT graduates take their startup ideas to MEST\u2019s current incubator fund\u2013 where ventures like customer service app Dropifi or electronic records platform Claimsync have received $50 to $100K seed rounds. The incubator (which invests around $1-2 million a year) has launched 20 companies to date. A handful have gone on to raise outside capital and two \u2014 Claimsync and messaging app Saya \u2014 have been acquired.\n\nWhile MEST\u2019s seed capital is currently limited to in-house EIT graduates, its new fund (beta name MEST Venture Partners) \u201cwill invest in MEST companies as well as companies outside of the MEST ecosystem,\u201d said Hansch. \u201cWe see opportunities for a Pan-African fund providing early stage capital to the best and brightest entrepreneurs and companies in the sectors we\u2019re most interested in, mainly digital businesses in ecommerce, edu-tech, digital media, fin-tech.\u201d\n\nHansch would only name \u201cwhen fundraising\u2019s done\u201d as a launch date and did not give a target value. He did confirm the new fund will make investments of $500K-$750K for early stage (live product) rounds, with occasional subsequent growth rounds reaching the $1-$2 million range.\n\nThese numbers may seem less than chump change to Silicon Valley players, but should be taken in context of the nascence of tech VC in Africa. Total annual VC to the continent\u2019s IT startups is only expected to reach $600 million by 2018, per a Crunchbase assisted analysis.\n\n\u201cFor perspective, a $50 million fund is effectively equivalent to a several hundred million dollar fund elsewhere,\u201d explained Hansch. \u201cOn the venture side, seed stage investments for upstart companies are generally in the sub $100K range. We\u2019re looking at $500K to seven figures for majority of our deal sizes\u2026Most everywhere else this would be called micro VC, but in Africa that\u2019s a pretty healthy size.\u201d\n\nMEST is tapping into global networks (namely its Silicon Valley office) for fundraising and will surely utilize its recently expanded IT entrepreneurship programs in Kenya and Nigeria for startup pitches.\n\nAs key pieces of Africa\u2019s new tech ecosystem emerge (see July TechCrunch piece breaking it down), tech incubators and co-creation spaces have become a mainstay. Like MEST, many began and continue to operate as grant based institutions, receiving funds through foundations, corporate CSR, or even aid agencies.\n\nA shift is emerging across Africa\u2019s notable innovation spaces toward profit oriented, VC focused, startup accelerator models. The Savannah Fund grew out of iHub, Nigeria\u2019s Co-Creation Hub launched its seed fund in 2014, and MEST Venture Partners will soon open a new tranche of investment to Africa\u2019s startups.", "author": "Jake Bright", "date": "2015-10-17 10:00:07"}]
