[{"date": ["2015-10-19"], "text": "<p>When a New York Times piece came out in August that described Amazon\u2019s workplace culture as \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html\">bruising</a>,\u201d Amazon cofounder and CEO Jeff Bezos acted quickly to dampen the story\u2019s blow. He <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2015/full-memo-jeff-bezos-responds-to-cutting-nyt-expose-says-tolerance-for-lack-of-empathy-needs-to-be-zero/\">wrote a memo</a> to employees saying the account \u201cdoesn\u2019t describe the Amazon I know\u201d and pointed out a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amazonians-response-inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-nick-ciubotariu\">separate piece</a> by an Amazon engineer who described the Times article as \u201cutter reader bait.\u201d</p><p>It was a smart approach, suggests Marina Ein, whose Washington, D.C.-based crisis communications firm has represented Michael Milken and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, among others. \u201cI thought the company was acting on very good advice,\u201d she says.</p><p>More confounding to Ein is a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@jaycarney/what-the-new-york-times-didn-t-tell-you-a1128aa78931\">new post</a> authored by former journalist and current Amazon spokesman Jay Carney, in which Carney not only systematically attacks the now two-month-old Times piece for being imbalanced but works to undermine several former employees\u00a0quoted in the story.</p><p>One is former site merchandiser Bo Olson, who spent roughly\u00a020 months at Amazon\u00a0and had told the Times for its story,\u00a0\u201cYou walk out of a conference room and you\u2019ll see a grown man covering his face\u00a0. . .\u00a0Nearly every person I worked with, I saw cry at their desk.\u201d</p><p>Wrote Carney of Olson today: \u201cHis\u00a0brief tenure at Amazon ended after an investigation revealed he had attempted to defraud vendors and conceal it by falsifying business records.\u00a0When confronted with the evidence, he\u00a0admitted it and resigned immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy,\u201d says Ein of Carney\u2019s unexpected missive. \u201cWhen you have a damaging story with collateral implications for the future, you tamp it down. You don\u2019t reawaken it and draw more attention to it than it might have received in the first place.\u201d (According to the Times, its Amazon piece has received more than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/business/amazon-spars-with-the-times-over-investigative-article.html\">five million page views</a> already, making it among the outlet\u2019s most-read stories of the year.)</p><p>Outing\u00a0Olson makes it worse, says Ein. \u201cNot only does it sound vindictive, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any time that it\u2019s wise for a company to get into the personal and confidential details of an employee\u2019s hiring or firing.\u201d</p><p>In\u00a0his post, Carney explains that Amazon felt compelled to take action when the New York Times wouldn\u2019t listen to its arguments. \u201cWe presented the Times with our findings several weeks ago, hoping they might take action to correct the record. They haven\u2019t, which is why we decided to write about it ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Unlike Ein, crisis manager Jeff Eller approves\u00a0of Amazon\u2019s no-holds-barred\u00a0strategy, noting that it has worked effectively in the past, including in a similar tussle between the New York Times and Wal-mart last year. One day after the Times published an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/opinion/timothy-egan-walmart-starbucks-and-the-fight-against-inequality.html\">opinion piece</a>\u00a0that characterized\u00a0Wal-mart as a \u201cnet drain on taxpayers,\u201d Wal-mart battled back, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.walmart.com/opportunity/20140620/fact-check-the-new-york-times-the-corporate-daddy\">cheekily annotating the piece</a> with notes that include, \u201cWe are the largest taxpayer in America. Can we see your math?\u201d</p><p>Says Eller, who represented\u00a0Firestone in its tire recall in 2000\u00a0and\u00a0General Motors in its ignition switch recall last year, \u201cThere\u2019s this inherent perception that the Times is too big to tackle. But\u00a0I don\u2019t think so. They put their pants on just like everybody does.\u201d</p><p>When a company like Amazon \u201cfeels it has reached the point of diminishing returns with any publication, whether it be the New York Times or Slate or the Dallas Morning News, you look at whether you take your case to a broader audience,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a big advocate of that.\u201d</p><p>Still, fighting back aggressively is one thing. Fighting back long\u00a0after people have stopped talking about a story is another. Certainly, the\u00a0timing of Amazon\u2019s newest response\u00a0to the Times is, well,\u00a0strange.</p><p>Indeed,\u00a0a third, top\u00a0crisis manager who asked not to be named has another theory about Amazon\u2019s latest lob, which is\u00a0that another shoe may be about\u00a0to\u00a0drop.</p><p>\u201cIt could be that Amazon is pissed off,\u201d as seems to be the case, says this veteran of public relations.\u00a0\u201cAmazon could also be trying to issue a warning; it\u00a0could be that there\u2019s a class-action suit in the works.\u201d (Indeed, employment attorneys have <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/19/amazon-softens-blow-of-times-article-but-its-too-soon-to-celebrate-say-attorneys/\">previously suggested</a>\u00a0that a\u00a0\u201ccreative attorney\u201d could probably make hay with the\u00a0anecdotes published in the Times.)</p><p>A third possibility, suggests this person, is that \u201csomething else is coming that we have no line of sight into yet, like a news magazine like \u201860 Minutes\u2019 or \u201820/20\u2019 that\u2019s preparing a segment.\u201d</p><p>Certainly, it wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented, given the many Times stories to be picked up by other outlets, including nightly news magazines. Amazon is understandably a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/60_minutes/video/lAZRiF8BTzazhjKy9ZlV5camUOze_71_/amazon-s-jeff-bezos-looks-to-the-future/\">popular</a> topic for their viewers, too.</p><p>Alas, only time will tell if the story of Amazon\u2019s workplace culture\u00a0fades away again or there\u2019s more to come.</p><p>Asked about Carney\u2019s post today, a spokesman for \u201c60 Minutes\u201d said simply in an email, \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss what we may or may not be working on.\u201d</p><p>Amazon declined to comment further.</p>", "title": ["Crisis Experts Debate Amazon\u2019s Latest Move: Another Shoe to Drop?"], "author": ["Connie Loizos"]},

The department\u00a0will be creating a task force comprising public and private industry leaders\u00a0to devise exactly how the registration system will work.</p><p>Secretary Foxx noted that the agency will be acting fast to develop and implement the registration plan. Specifically, the DOT hopes the task force will have recommendations in place by the middle of November, with a registration being implemented before the end of December.</p><p>Foxx said that registration will reinforce the need for hobbyists and drone operators to learn the airspace rules before they fly, and use their devices safely. Secondly, he noted that registration will allow these rules to be enforced, and let the FAA identify any operator who breaks these rules.</p><p>The agency said that while it\u00a0is currently easy\u00a0to locate the actual drone that may have violated illegal airspace, it\u2019s difficult to find the operator of the offending drone, and this registration will close that loophole.</p><p>This announcement comes after a sharp rise in \u201cnear misses\u201d between aircrafts and drones throughout the U.S. over the last year.

Today, the company is attempting to change that with the rollout of an entirely made-over version of its iOS application that introduces a cleaner, less-cluttered interface designed to simplify accessing Waze\u2019s key features, and speed up the time it takes to report traffic problems.</p><p>While\u00a0traditional mapping applications, like those from Apple and Google, are still the most popular among smartphone users, Waze has a strong following among drivers and commuters thanks to its ability to alert you\u00a0to traffic conditions. Beyond just telling you that traffic is slow, Waze can tell you why \u2013 maybe there\u2019s an accident ahead, or a stalled vehicle. Users also like it for its ability to alert you\u00a0when cops have been spotted\u00a0nearby \u2013 something that makes Waze something of an alternative to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drivinglaws.aaa.com/tag/radar-detectors/\">radar detectors</a>.</p><p>Plus, its ability to route you around bad traffic in real-time as conditions change is especially helpful, as is its ability to let you add a stop while planning your route.</p><p>Today, Waze has over 50 million active users who log into Waze monthly, the company says.</p><p>But despite having a collection of useful features, the app\u2019s interface itself has needed work for some time. Instead of a modern, clean aesthetic, Waze previously relied on a couple of menus \u2013 one with a cartoon-ish car icon to access the main menu, and the other map pin-shaped icon with an exclamation point in the middle for reporting incidents. And the map itself was messy and cluttered, making it hard to read.</p><p><em>The old version of Waze:</em></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1225826\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/waze-old.png?w=680&amp;h=383\" alt=\"waze-old\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\"></p><p>With the new version of the app, Waze offers a de-cluttered map, and it makes the alerting feature more prominent \u2013 it\u2019s an orange icon with a rounder pin. Meanwhile, the car icon with\u00a0access to the menu and other settings has been relocated to the bottom-left. When you\u2019re in a hurry \u2013 as drivers are behind the wheel (they\u2019re not supposed to be using the app in-route, but of course they do) \u2013 this makes it easier and faster to participate in the Waze community because\u00a0it\u2019s more obvious which button to press to add a report.</p><p>In addition, the updated app now features quick access to a contacts section (as indicated by the mail envelope icon), where you can share directions with\u00a0your contacts, send your location, and your ETA with a tap.</p><p><em>The New Waze (ver 4.0):\u00a0</em></p><p>A bottom menu also slides up when tapped to offer you easy access to things like alternate routes, the \u201cadd a stop\u201d feature, as well as a shortcut to sending your ETA to a friend or family member.</p><p>Nearly everything you do in Waze now takes fewer taps, which is another one of the\u00a0bigger improvements over the prior version. And the menus themselves have been redesigned, too, to be quicker to use. For instance, the reporting menu now uses big, brightly-colored, round buttons for things like reporting accidents, road hazards, police, and more.</p><p>Waze 4.0 also lets you sync your Calendar to the app so you can receive alerts reminding you when to leave, based on traffic conditions. The company says it has made other improvements, too, like better battery life.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new app still relies on its bubbly,\u00a0cartoon-ish icons. This is a personal preference, of course, but I think it\u2019s time to move away from this sort of juvenile look. It\u2019s frankly just\u00a0sort of silly to see cars with bows on their head, or pacifiers in their mouth, or wearing little crowns in an\u00a0app aimed at adults old enough to drive a car.</p><p>The new design is certainly an improvement, but Waze still hasn\u2019t delivered a truly sleek look-and-feel.\u00a0Even now, there\u2019s too much to look at on the screen.</p><p>Because Waze already\u00a0shows things other mapping apps don\u2019t have \u2013 like the\u00a0other cars and graphics like ads for business as little road signs \u00a0\u2013 it needs to be even more\u00a0careful about what other buttons should\u00a0appear. Now it features\u00a0an\u00a0orange reporting button, a MPH indicator, the time, ETA, and distance, and a big button for finding your current geo-location. This latter item is positioned to the left and sort of up near the middle of the screen,\u00a0though Apple and Google Maps put this feature closer to the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Plus, when you tap on the screen, tons of other buttons appear, including the compass, sound toggle, zooming feature, and when at a particular zoom level, your location finder. Combined with all the car icons and icons of signs, alert icons, and more, Waze still struggles with offering a truly clean-looking\u00a0map.</p><p>Off the top of my head, I can still spot a number of things I\u2019d change. For starters, Waze needs to ditch the MPH button entirely \u2013 drivers look at this on their car\u2019s dashboard anyway. The geo-location feature needs to be much smaller and closer to the bottom of the screen.The bottom of the screen doesn\u2019t need a greeting (e.g. <em>\u201cGood Afternoon\u201d</em>) when no route is in progress. And there\u2019s no need to flag how many new messages you have and add a red dot to indicate you have unread mail \u2013 this could all be handled with a push notification and red icon badge on your iOS homescreen.</p><p>That said, Waze certainly looks <em>better</em> than before, if not great.</p><p>The updated app, Waze 4.0, is live on the iTunes Store now with an Android release soon to follow.</p>", "title": ["Navigation App Waze Gets A Huge Redesign \u2013 Now Less Cluttered, But Still Needs Improvement"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

Built into Messenger, M lets users text in almost any request, from assistance with online chores to booking real-world services or making purchases on their behalf. Requests are currently fielded by a combination of Facebook workers and artificial intelligence.</p><p>The hope is that over time, the humans will teach the AI to do more and more complicated tasks on their own.

But the big opportunity is for Facebook to lock users further into its ecosystem where it makes ample money on News Feed ads. One day, Facebook could even sell ads that convince you to initiate an M request that involves an advertiser\u2019s business.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_3269.jpg\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_3269.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a><br>\nRight now, Facebook tells me the No. 1 type of request is for restaurant suggestions and reservations. People might know their desired food type, distance, price range, or some quality they\u2019re looking for in a restaurant, and M helps find them the one that fits and gets them a table.</p><p>Local search requests are the second most popular. Here, M assists people with finding local businesses, places, or services that solve their needs. Users might ask where they can buy, book an appointment for, or see something nearby, and M directs them.</p><p>The third top request type is for purchasing assistance. Rather than have to go to a store in person or deal with online payment flows, M could make purchases on someone\u2019s\u00a0behalf using the payment info they have on file with Facebook. This way a desire can turn into a delivered product with minimal effort on the user\u2019s part.</p><p>Other top request types include ordering flowers, getting food, arranging travel, finding upcoming weather reports, and being reminded of approaching appointments.</p><p><strong>Some examples of M usage that Facebook saw include:</strong></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_3270.jpg\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_3270.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a><br>\nThese are not things that SMS or any random chat app can do.

Researchers at NYU have published a paper showing how to infect devices such as smartphones with the digital version of the disease.</p><p>In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://goo.gl/uRZHxs\">a paper</a> titled \u201cMAGIC: Malicious Aging in Circuits/Cores,\u201d NYU computer scientists lay out a series of methods to attack hardware by aging integrated circuits rapidly and causing them to wear out. The effects of such an attack on a <span class=\"il\">smartphone</span>, for instance, <span class=\"il\">could</span> include slow performance or even failure of the device.</p><p>\u201cGenerally when companies manufacture integrated circuits, they are built for a lifetime. When we studied the aging process, we observed it is input dependent. If you run certain programs, you can make the degradation occur faster,\u201d said Arun Kanuparthi, one of the authors of the paper at NYU. \u201cWhat we were able to do is create a malicious program that, when you run it on a phone, can crash it in just a month.\u201d</p><p>Why would anyone want to do that? There are many reasons that consumers \u2014\u00a0or even companies \u2014\u00a0might try to use such software to kill devices.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The first scenario the paper describes is the warranty scenario. \u201cLet\u2019s say you just bought a new phone,\u201d says Kanuparthi, \u201cand the company that manufactures that phone announces that they are launching a new model. You want that new phone, so you download this malicious app, run it on <span class=\"il\">your</span> phone, say that it is broken, and trade it in for the new model.\u201d Essentially, the software tortures the chip to death. \u201cThink of it this way,\u201d says Kanuparthi. \u201cIf you eat too many cheesy puffs and drink a lot of soda, what happens to you? We essentially put the transistors in the integrated circuit under a lot of stress by force feeding them.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p>The second scenario is the planned obsolescence scenario. In this scenario, a company seeking to drive sales of a newer device might intentionally degrade the performance of an older device already on the market in order to drive the consumer to upgrade. \u201cCompanies might want to force consumers to buy newer products,\u201d says Kanuparthi. \u201cThere have been several issues \u2014 the paper cites these \u2014 of really big companies\u00a0suspected of doing planned obsolescence. A Blu-ray player crashing a day before the warranty runs out, or a phone suddenly slowing down after a software patch, just before a new model is launched. Then you go to the store and try out the new phone and you see a blazing difference in the performance and are compelled to buy the new phone.\u201d</p><p>The third scenario is the state-sponsored hardware back door. \u201cIn this attack scenario, let\u2019s say a country purchases military equipment from another country. The country that sold the equipment might have friendly relations with its customer today, but who knows what happens ten years down the line,\u201d says Kanuparthi. The selling country may wish to maliciously age the devices and ruin their functionality by installing a software patch.</p><p>The researchers go on to lay out the effectiveness of their approach at beating mechanisms to mitigate these attacks, and a number of methods circuit makers might use to fend off malicious aging. Future research will look at how to mitigate these attacks on a variety of processor architectures. With recent deceptions such as the Volkswagen scandal, in which embedded software tricked emissions tests, consumer watchdogs and regulators alike should pay special attention to instances of hardware obsolescence, and keep an eye out for any curious case.</p>", "title": ["How Attackers Could Send Your Smartphone To An Early Grave"], "author": ["Justin Hendrix"]},

That\u2019s not so good.</p><p>IBM\u2019s revenue clocked its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-revenue-falls-14th-straight-200923682.html\">fourteenth\u00a0straight</a> quarterly decline in the third quarter.</p><p>Not all the news was bad. The company\u2019s annual run rate from \u201ccloud delivered as a service,\u201d which IBM notes is\u00a0\u201ca subset of [its] total cloud revenue\u201d grew from $3.1 billion in the year-ago quarter, to $4.5 billion in its most recent.</p><p>IBM wrapped its quarter with debt of $39.7 billion in debt, down slightly from the start of the year. Core debt, however, rose by $2.0 billion since the start of the year to $13.7 billion since last day of 2014.</p><p>Summing quickly, IBM remains mired in a business transition. While its cloud revenues, and incomes from other future-focused products are increasing, the company is hardly done rebuilding itself. The revenue miss, the chronic top line\u00a0declines, and falling profitability paint the picture of a ship that has not yet turned around.</p><p>At the same time, IBM is massively profitable, and valuable. Another 4\u00a0percent haircut to its valuation won\u2019t change much.

The Eora 3D scanner, however, is allowed because it takes 3D scans using a device that is surprisingly simple yet exceedingly complex and only uses one camera.</p><p>Created by Rahul Koduri and Asfand Khan of Sydney, Australia the project came about when they were working on concentrating solar rays. They have just launched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/259051227/eora-3d-high-precision-3d-scanning-on-your-smartph\">their product on Kickstarter</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe eora 3D Scanner was born out of our own need for an affordable and highly-precise 3D scanner,\u201d said Koduri. \u201cWe needed to capture the specifications of a reflective parabolic dish that was used to track the sun\u2019s trajectory to improve solar power output. When we originally looked for what was available we were shocked that scanners that are precise to sub-100 microns cost atleast $5000.\u201d</p><p>The team began working on an early prototype and realized that they had a real product on their hands.</p><p>The system works by scanning the surface a green laser. The laser connects via Bluetooth to your phone camera and allows you to create a point cloud of the object in alarming detail. Best of all the system scans in full color \u2013 a unique feature that I haven\u2019t seen in a smaller scanner.</p><p>\u201cThe eora 3D Scanner has a Green laser, as CMOS sensors in cameras are twice as sensitive to the green spectrum which allows for 3D Scanning in a variety of conditions even outdoors,\u201d said Koduri. \u201cThis is due to human beings evolving in green landscapes/brushes, so our eyes are also more sensitive to the green spectrum.\u201d</p><p>The models can be used in games, for 3D printing, and for prototyping. One scan the team showed me \u2013 an Assassin\u2019s Creed character \u2013 was surprisingly detailed for a simple scan. Scans can take as little as 3 minutes in some cases but more complex scans take a little longer. The system includes an automatic turntable to turn the object in space so you can capture all sides at sub-100 micron accuracy.</p><p style=\"font-size:13px;font-weight:normal;margin:5px;color:#4A4A4A;\">\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/df595d9ccea145f3b37c94f7bd0a9410?utm_source=oembed&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=df595d9ccea145f3b37c94f7bd0a9410\" style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#1CAAD9;\">Cup Face</a><br>\n    by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sketchfab.com/eora3d?utm_source=oembed&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=df595d9ccea145f3b37c94f7bd0a9410\" style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#1CAAD9;\">eora 3D</a><br>\n    on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sketchfab.com?utm_source=oembed&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=df595d9ccea145f3b37c94f7bd0a9410\" style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#1CAAD9;\">Sketchfab</a>\n</p><p>Early bird units cost $199 and the team is looking to raise $50,000.

Flooding the next.</p><p>If we\u2019ve learned anything in the agriculture industry in recent years, it\u2019s that climate change and extreme weather patterns are the new reality\u00a0\u2014 and all of us have to plan accordingly to help ensure the safety of our food supply. Developers included.</p><p>The plan to keep the agricultural industry thriving now includes the tech sector, with more and more technology and software being adopted in the field to help farmers produce more food in the face of today\u2019s climate and industry challenges.</p><p>One such challenge in recent years has been making sense of the avalanche of data precision agriculture technology is churning out via in-field sensors, weather stations, satellites and GPS monitoring and mapping tools.</p><p>In an attempt to make some of those data sources more actionable and user-friendly for the ag industry, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome\">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> has partnered with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/\">Microsoft</a> to launch the \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://usdaapps.challengepost.com/\">Innovation Challenge</a>,\u201d a hackathon that runs through Oct. 27 and challenges developers to create applications that leverage new publicly available data from the USDA.</p><p>The hackathon is being hosted by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://devpost.com/\">Devpost</a>, an online community and competition platform comprised of more than 400,000 software developers, and leverages <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://usdaapps.devpost.com/details/resources\">data sets</a> hosted on Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud-computing platform.

By bringing together some of the key USDA data sets into one Farm Data Dashboard, we hope to have reduced some of the data discovery pain for our participants and let them move more quickly into building useful applications and services.\u201d</p><p>The USDA is making much of this data, part of its Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) and Economic Research Service (ERS), available to the public for the first time.</p><p>NASS, for example, has opened up access to its\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://usdaapps.devpost.com/details/resources\">CropScape and VegScape APIs</a>. CropScape provides geospatial data through annual land cover data sets, while VegScape is a vegetative condition database compiled from satellite data.</p><p>Those data sets are considered a jumping off point for app developers, who are encouraged to incorporate other relevant data points, which could include sources from other government agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) or the United States Geological Survey (USGS).</p><p>\u201cThe President launched the Climate Data Initiative to leverage the government\u2019s massive amounts of data to develop new and different ways to address system vulnerabilities to climate change, including vulnerabilities of the food supply,\u201d said Dr. Ann Bartuska, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics. \u201cThrough our partnership with Microsoft, USDA can make the large amounts of agricultural data that we\u2019ve collected over the last 100 years readily available to the private sector and empower developers to turn this data into innovative tools and solutions for our stakeholders. It is a way for us to connect the dots across different sources like we\u2019ve never done before.\u201d</p><p>The challenge, which supports President Obama\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-US/projects/azure/cdi.aspx\">White House Climate Data Initiative</a>, offers $60,000 in prizes for applications that leverage the USDA data to provide actionable insights into the U.S. food system for farmers, agriculture businesses, scientists or consumers. Microsoft is also granting <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/azure/cdi2.aspx\">cloud-computing awards</a> to aid university researchers and students who take part in the challenge.</p><p>Submissions will be taken through October 27. After a short judging period (November 4-17), winners will be announced December 2.</p><p>\u201cThe era of climate-driven agriculture has arrived,\u201d Bartuska added. \u201cAgriculture is at the crossroads of some of the world\u2019s most critical challenges: climate change, sustainable food production, providing clean and abundant water, renewable energy, and improving human health. Those challenges are immense, especially when you consider that we must meet the food needs of a world population that is expected to top 9 billion people by mid-century.

Today, the company is attempting to change that with the rollout of an entirely made-over version of its iOS application that introduces a cleaner, less-cluttered interface designed to simplify accessing Waze\u2019s key features, and speed up the time it takes to report traffic problems.</p><p>While\u00a0traditional mapping applications, like those from Apple and Google, are still the most popular among smartphone users, Waze has a strong following among drivers and commuters thanks to its ability to alert you\u00a0to traffic conditions. Beyond just telling you that traffic is slow, Waze can tell you why \u2013 maybe there\u2019s an accident ahead, or a stalled vehicle. Users also like it for its ability to alert you\u00a0when cops have been spotted\u00a0nearby \u2013 something that makes Waze something of an alternative to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drivinglaws.aaa.com/tag/radar-detectors/\">radar detectors</a>.</p><p>Plus, its ability to route you around bad traffic in real-time as conditions change is especially helpful, as is its ability to let you add a stop while planning your route.</p><p>Today, Waze has over 50 million active users who log into Waze monthly, the company says.</p><p>But despite having a collection of useful features, the app\u2019s interface itself has needed work for some time. Instead of a modern, clean aesthetic, Waze previously relied on a couple of menus \u2013 one with a cartoon-ish car icon to access the main menu, and the other map pin-shaped icon with an exclamation point in the middle for reporting incidents. And the map itself was messy and cluttered, making it hard to read.</p><p><em>The old version of Waze:</em></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1225826\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/waze-old.png?w=680&amp;h=383\" alt=\"waze-old\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\"></p><p>With the new version of the app, Waze offers a de-cluttered map, and it makes the alerting feature more prominent \u2013 it\u2019s an orange icon with a rounder pin. Meanwhile, the car icon with\u00a0access to the menu and other settings has been relocated to the bottom-left. When you\u2019re in a hurry \u2013 as drivers are behind the wheel (they\u2019re not supposed to be using the app in-route, but of course they do) \u2013 this makes it easier and faster to participate in the Waze community because\u00a0it\u2019s more obvious which button to press to add a report.</p><p>In addition, the updated app now features quick access to a contacts section (as indicated by the mail envelope icon), where you can share directions with\u00a0your contacts, send your location, and your ETA with a tap.</p><p><em>The New Waze (ver 4.0):\u00a0</em></p><p>A bottom menu also slides up when tapped to offer you easy access to things like alternate routes, the \u201cadd a stop\u201d feature, as well as a shortcut to sending your ETA to a friend or family member.</p><p>Nearly everything you do in Waze now takes fewer taps, which is another one of the\u00a0bigger improvements over the prior version. And the menus themselves have been redesigned, too, to be quicker to use. For instance, the reporting menu now uses big, brightly-colored, round buttons for things like reporting accidents, road hazards, police, and more.</p><p>Waze 4.0 also lets you sync your Calendar to the app so you can receive alerts reminding you when to leave, based on traffic conditions. The company says it has made other improvements, too, like better battery life.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new app still relies on its bubbly,\u00a0cartoon-ish icons. This is a personal preference, of course, but I think it\u2019s time to move away from this sort of juvenile look. It\u2019s frankly just\u00a0sort of silly to see cars with bows on their head, or pacifiers in their mouth, or wearing little crowns in an\u00a0app aimed at adults old enough to drive a car.</p><p>The new design is certainly an improvement, but Waze still hasn\u2019t delivered a truly sleek look-and-feel.\u00a0Even now, there\u2019s too much to look at on the screen.</p><p>Because Waze already\u00a0shows things other mapping apps don\u2019t have \u2013 like the\u00a0other cars and graphics like ads for business as little road signs \u00a0\u2013 it needs to be even more\u00a0careful about what other buttons should\u00a0appear. Now it features\u00a0an\u00a0orange reporting button, a MPH indicator, the time, ETA, and distance, and a big button for finding your current geo-location. This latter item is positioned to the left and sort of up near the middle of the screen,\u00a0though Apple and Google Maps put this feature closer to the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Plus, when you tap on the screen, tons of other buttons appear, including the compass, sound toggle, zooming feature, and when at a particular zoom level, your location finder. Combined with all the car icons and icons of signs, alert icons, and more, Waze still struggles with offering a truly clean-looking\u00a0map.</p><p>Off the top of my head, I can still spot a number of things I\u2019d change. For starters, Waze needs to ditch the MPH button entirely \u2013 drivers look at this on their car\u2019s dashboard anyway. The geo-location feature needs to be much smaller and closer to the bottom of the screen.The bottom of the screen doesn\u2019t need a greeting (e.g. <em>\u201cGood Afternoon\u201d</em>) when no route is in progress. And there\u2019s no need to flag how many new messages you have and add a red dot to indicate you have unread mail \u2013 this could all be handled with a push notification and red icon badge on your iOS homescreen.</p><p>That said, Waze certainly looks <em>better</em> than before, if not great.</p><p>The updated app, Waze 4.0, is live on the iTunes Store now with an Android release soon to follow.</p>", "title": ["Navigation App Waze Gets A Huge Redesign \u2013 Now Less Cluttered, But Still Needs Improvement"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

You don\u2019t reawaken it and draw more attention to it than it might have received in the first place.\u201d (According to the Times, its Amazon piece has received more than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/business/amazon-spars-with-the-times-over-investigative-article.html\">five million page views</a> already, making it among the outlet\u2019s most-read stories of the year.)</p><p>Outing\u00a0Olson makes it worse, says Ein. \u201cNot only does it sound vindictive, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any time that it\u2019s wise for a company to get into the personal and confidential details of an employee\u2019s hiring or firing.\u201d</p><p>In\u00a0his post, Carney explains that Amazon felt compelled to take action when the New York Times wouldn\u2019t listen to its arguments. \u201cWe presented the Times with our findings several weeks ago, hoping they might take action to correct the record. They haven\u2019t, which is why we decided to write about it ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Unlike Ein, crisis manager Jeff Eller approves\u00a0of Amazon\u2019s no-holds-barred\u00a0strategy, noting that it has worked effectively in the past, including in a similar tussle between the New York Times and Wal-mart last year. One day after the Times published an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/opinion/timothy-egan-walmart-starbucks-and-the-fight-against-inequality.html\">opinion piece</a>\u00a0that characterized\u00a0Wal-mart as a \u201cnet drain on taxpayers,\u201d Wal-mart battled back, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.walmart.com/opportunity/20140620/fact-check-the-new-york-times-the-corporate-daddy\">cheekily annotating the piece</a> with notes that include, \u201cWe are the largest taxpayer in America. Can we see your math?\u201d</p><p>Says Eller, who represented\u00a0Firestone in its tire recall in 2000\u00a0and\u00a0General Motors in its ignition switch recall last year, \u201cThere\u2019s this inherent perception that the Times is too big to tackle. But\u00a0I don\u2019t think so. They put their pants on just like everybody does.\u201d</p><p>When a company like Amazon \u201cfeels it has reached the point of diminishing returns with any publication, whether it be the New York Times or Slate or the Dallas Morning News, you look at whether you take your case to a broader audience,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a big advocate of that.\u201d</p><p>Still, fighting back aggressively is one thing. Fighting back long\u00a0after people have stopped talking about a story is another. Certainly, the\u00a0timing of Amazon\u2019s newest response\u00a0to the Times is, well,\u00a0strange.</p><p>Indeed,\u00a0a third, top\u00a0crisis manager who asked not to be named has another theory about Amazon\u2019s latest lob, which is\u00a0that another shoe may be about\u00a0to\u00a0drop.</p><p>\u201cIt could be that Amazon is pissed off,\u201d as seems to be the case, says this veteran of public relations.\u00a0\u201cAmazon could also be trying to issue a warning; it\u00a0could be that there\u2019s a class-action suit in the works.\u201d (Indeed, employment attorneys have <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/19/amazon-softens-blow-of-times-article-but-its-too-soon-to-celebrate-say-attorneys/\">previously suggested</a>\u00a0that a\u00a0\u201ccreative attorney\u201d could probably make hay with the\u00a0anecdotes published in the Times.)</p><p>A third possibility, suggests this person, is that \u201csomething else is coming that we have no line of sight into yet, like a news magazine like \u201860 Minutes\u2019 or \u201820/20\u2019 that\u2019s preparing a segment.\u201d</p><p>Certainly, it wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented, given the many Times stories to be picked up by other outlets, including nightly news magazines. Amazon is understandably a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/60_minutes/video/lAZRiF8BTzazhjKy9ZlV5camUOze_71_/amazon-s-jeff-bezos-looks-to-the-future/\">popular</a> topic for their viewers, too.</p><p>Alas, only time will tell if the story of Amazon\u2019s workplace culture\u00a0fades away again or there\u2019s more to come.</p><p>Asked about Carney\u2019s post today, a spokesman for \u201c60 Minutes\u201d said simply in an email, \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss what we may or may not be working on.\u201d</p><p>Amazon declined to comment further.</p>", "title": ["Crisis Experts Debate Amazon\u2019s Latest Move: Another Shoe to Drop?"], "author": ["Connie Loizos"]},

The company says that it will give interested customers access to Google Apps for Work for free, while they\u2019re still under an enterprise agreement (EA) with another provider. While Google didn\u2019t call out\u00a0Microsoft or IBM by name when making the announcement, it\u2019s well understood\u00a0that these are the top competitors for its Google Apps productivity suite and related tools.</p><p>In addition, Google directly\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/enterprise-agreement/\">references the two competitors</a>\u00a0on its \u201coffer\u201d page for the new promotion.</p><p>According to a Google blog <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://googleforwork.blogspot.com/2015/10/going-Google-just-got-easier.html\">post</a>, the company will cover the fees associated with Google Apps for Work until the customer\u2019s existing contract runs out. And it says it will chip in on some of the deployment costs following the earlier contract\u2019s expiration, by\u00a0also connecting the new customer with a Google for Work Partner.</p><p>The company claims that customers can see cost savings of up to 70 percent by switching. This figure is based on a basic Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, Google <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/work/apps/business/files/google-apps-for-work-analysis-70.pdf\">explains</a>\u00a0(PDF) on the Google Apps website.</p><p>There are some caveats, of course. Google is capping the amount it covers for deployment at $25 per user, so the cost to switch is not necessarily going to be \u201czero.\u201d However, there will be no bill for Google Apps for Work\u00a0until the prior EA runs out.</p><p>Microsoft, of course, has been making some fierce inroads of its own with its Office 365 software.

GE, notably, had been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Google-Apps-makes-its-way-into-big-business\">one of the earlier\u00a0customers</a> to deploy Google Apps in years past. That meant\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s ability to bring them back to the fold was sort of a double punch for Google.</p><p>Google didn\u2019t say how long this promotion would be available, but it\u2019s only offered to those customers in the U.S. or Canada, at present. Meanwhile, the company says it\u2019s working on bringing the offer to global markets in the future.</p><p>Google Apps for Work, which includes Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms, and Drive along with calendaring and communications tools like Gmail, Hangouts, Calendar, and more, as well as an IT\u00a0dashboard for management, starts at $5 per user per month, or increases to $10 per user per month for unlimited storage space and \u201cVault,\u201d a system for eDiscovery of emails, chats, docs and files.</p><p>By taking on the costs associated with an EA \u2013 a tool Microsoft uses to keep customers locked into contracts for longer periods of time in return for better pricing \u2013 Google is fighting back against one of Microsoft\u2019s most powerful tools associated with retention.</p>", "title": ["Google Goes After Microsoft And IBM By Making Google Apps For Work Free While Customers Still Under Competitor\u2019s Contract"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

The Eora 3D scanner, however, is allowed because it takes 3D scans using a device that is surprisingly simple yet exceedingly complex and only uses one camera.</p><p>Created by Rahul Koduri and Asfand Khan of Sydney, Australia the project came about when they were working on concentrating solar rays. They have just launched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/259051227/eora-3d-high-precision-3d-scanning-on-your-smartph\">their product on Kickstarter</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe eora 3D Scanner was born out of our own need for an affordable and highly-precise 3D scanner,\u201d said Koduri. \u201cWe needed to capture the specifications of a reflective parabolic dish that was used to track the sun\u2019s trajectory to improve solar power output. When we originally looked for what was available we were shocked that scanners that are precise to sub-100 microns cost atleast $5000.\u201d</p><p>The team began working on an early prototype and realized that they had a real product on their hands.</p><p>The system works by scanning the surface a green laser. The laser connects via Bluetooth to your phone camera and allows you to create a point cloud of the object in alarming detail. Best of all the system scans in full color \u2013 a unique feature that I haven\u2019t seen in a smaller scanner.</p><p>\u201cThe eora 3D Scanner has a Green laser, as CMOS sensors in cameras are twice as sensitive to the green spectrum which allows for 3D Scanning in a variety of conditions even outdoors,\u201d said Koduri. \u201cThis is due to human beings evolving in green landscapes/brushes, so our eyes are also more sensitive to the green spectrum.\u201d</p><p>The models can be used in games, for 3D printing, and for prototyping. One scan the team showed me \u2013 an Assassin\u2019s Creed character \u2013 was surprisingly detailed for a simple scan. Scans can take as little as 3 minutes in some cases but more complex scans take a little longer. The system includes an automatic turntable to turn the object in space so you can capture all sides at sub-100 micron accuracy.</p><p style=\"font-size:13px;font-weight:normal;margin:5px;color:#4A4A4A;\">\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/df595d9ccea145f3b37c94f7bd0a9410?utm_source=oembed&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=df595d9ccea145f3b37c94f7bd0a9410\" style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#1CAAD9;\">Cup Face</a><br>\n    by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sketchfab.com/eora3d?utm_source=oembed&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=df595d9ccea145f3b37c94f7bd0a9410\" style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#1CAAD9;\">eora 3D</a><br>\n    on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sketchfab.com?utm_source=oembed&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=df595d9ccea145f3b37c94f7bd0a9410\" style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#1CAAD9;\">Sketchfab</a>\n</p><p>Early bird units cost $199 and the team is looking to raise $50,000.

Their new suite combines a cloud-based Integrated Development Environment with integrated game engines for physics and visualization. Along with that, Weeby.co also seamlessly integrates games with social networks and competitive play.</p><p>Weeby.co wants to shorten the long process associated with developing apps for mobile devices. Instead of going through the tedious iOS development process and waiting for Apple to approve an app submitted to the store, developers can deploy and share games built in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp\">HTML5 </a>as they are built. Much of this, Carter explained, is because HTML5 games today can be built with the same capabilities and features that were once restricted to native apps.</p><p>\u201cYour phone is actually a development environment,\u201d said Carter. \u201cYou can actually build native iOS apps while running on iOS, or Android apps on an iOS device.

By keeping their entire system in the cloud, the company cuts down significantly on development time, taking 5 times less time than development in XCode.</p><p>Users currently have the option to download their HTML5 games, or instantly build them as native smartphone apps. However, if they so choose, Weeby.co will host games on their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Web Services\u2019 Simple Storage Service</a> account for free and send developers a hyperlink to where the game is hosted.</p><p>Long-term, though, the company\u2019s goals are far more than just building a game development environment. Carter wants to be a game publisher as well, working with \u2018alternative\u2019 app stores based inside web browsers embedded inside apps like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wechat.com\">WeChat</a>.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sort of like Adobe plus Steam,\u201d said Carter. \u201cWe want to build the very best tools that make apps and games everywhere, and we have one right now which is faster and better than XCode and our other competitors.\u201d</p><p>While the company intends to let anyone use the development environment, Weeby.co will treat content publication on their partner app stores as a premium service.</p><p>\u201cRight now, we\u2019re intending to allow anyone to use the game developing IDE, but the professional side is the [publication] service,\u201d said Carter.</p><p>As grand as their current vision is, the company\u2019s vision for the future is even larger.</p><p>\u201cWe have this vision of the future, where we want to facilitate the next generation of children learning to code,\u201d said Michael.</p><p>The inspiration for this came from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://media.mit.edu\">MIT\u2019s Media Lab</a>, which develops a visual programming language for children called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://scratch.mit.edu\">Scratch</a>, and allows children to make a copy of a game and start independent development on it, making their own modifications.</p><p>Whether or not Weeby.co will be able to take the reins of development out of the hands of XCode and Apple remains to be seen.

Speculation has had the sale at $1 billion to $1.3 billion, and so far there is no price on the deal, but a source tells TechCrunch that it was done for $1.1 billion. </p><p><strong>Update</strong>: Waze has also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waze.com/blog/waze-joins-google/\">published a blog post</a> on the acquisition. In it, CEO Noam Bardin writes that CEO Larry Page, Google GEO VP Brian McClendon and the Google Maps teams \u201cWe are excited about the prospect of working with the Google Maps team to enhance our search capabilities and to join them in their ongoing efforts to build the best map of the world.\u201d He also notes that \u201cnothing practical will change,\u201d with the company, now pushing 50 million users, \u201cwill maintain our community, brand, service and organization.\u201d </p><p>He also raises the subject of why Waze decided to sell. Bardin says that it was motivated by the fact that an IPO appeared the route that would take the company more into being focused on returns and less on growing as a product for users. \u201cChoosing the path of an IPO often shifts attention to bankers, lawyers and the happiness of Wall Street, and we decided we\u2019d rather spend our time with you, the Waze community.\u201d Of course, the burden of getting a return on the investment now become\u2019s Google\u2019s, but as you can see below there are a number of reasons why it would buy Waze, anyway.

An additional $100M will be awarded to employees based on performance.\u201d</p><p>This is a doubly strategic move for Google. The purchase comes in the wake of what appeared to be failed negotiations between the Israel-based startup two big rivals of the search giant: Facebook, which was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/09/reports-facebook-is-buying-social-mapping-and-traffic-app-waze-for-up-to-1b-to-court-more-mobile-users/\">eyeing up the company</a> but apparently faltered at the due dilligence phase; and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/03/apple-not-buying-waze/\">Apple</a> (neither company ever publicly confirmed interest in acquiring Waze).</p><p>The news comes after a particularly heated few days in which reports of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000850934&amp;fid=1725\">Google\u2019s interest in Waze</a> reached <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130609/this-time-its-real-google-waze-deal-on-the-way/\">new heights</a>, after first surfacing <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/24/another-google-waze-rumour/\">two weeks ago</a>. In the wildfire that is internet publishing, many even went so far as to report it as a done deal, making things even more confusing.</p><p>Waze had raised some $67 million in funding from Blue Run Ventures, Magma, Vertex, Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &amp; Byers, and Horizon Ventures. And it looks like the majority of the payout in the sale will go to these VCs. Globes, the Israeli business newspaper that first reported the latest interest from Google, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000851150\">estimated that payouts</a> to co-founders \u2014 Ehud Shabtai, Amir and Gili Shinar, Uri Levine, Arie Gillon \u2014 and its CEO Noam Bardin, will be under $200 million in total.</p><p>There are at least a couple of places where you can see Google making use of Waze data.</p><p><strong>Social</strong>. Under CEO Larry Page, Google has been especially bullish on where it positions itself on social, which it has been hinging on Google+ as a kind of web across all of its other properties to show you, the user, what those you know are doing, and also to let your connections see what you are looking at online. Taking a page from Facebook\u2019s book, the thinking goes that this helps with discovery and engagement.</p><p>Waze, as a crowdsourced location platform, would give Google an additional, very mobile-based angle on this concept, letting users not just share places (i.e. sites) visited on the web, but actual places visited physically. As Bardim noted at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130426/maps-are-for-mobile-what-search-is-for-the-web-says-waze-ceo-noam-bardin/\">AllThingsD conference in April</a>, \u201cWhat search is for the web, maps are for mobile.\u201d By this, he means that most of the searches you do on mobile have to do with location, and Waze is one of the few companies out there that is bringing that kind of search together with actual map data and a social layer. (The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/technology/mobile-companies-crave-maps-that-live-and-breathe.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0\">NYT</a> ran an interesting piece yesterday with one mapping company describing how maps on mobile specifically become a \u201ccanvas\u201d for all other apps.)</p><p><strong>Competition</strong>. Waze could be a two-pronged fork for Google: On one hand, it gives the search giant nice, healthy wedge into the mass of consumers who are already using the app on iOS devices. But it also, if reports are to be believed, also gives Google a way of <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/09/googles-inroads-for-waze-could-roadblock-facebook-and-apple/\">roadblocking</a> how companies like Facebook could use Waze\u2019s assets. As the startup likes to point out, it\u2019s not a mapping company, but a big data player. Facebook, making its own big push on mobile, would have been a natural home for a socially-focused company like Waze, which also happens to be one of the few home-grown mapping databases around. This will mean that Facebook will need to have to continue to use third-party data for its own location-based searches and information, or less look to acquire elsewhere.</p><p>(Now could be a good time to wonder whether Nokia might consider offloading <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.navteq.com\">Navteq</a>, its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/18/nokia-misses-with-sales-of-7-6b-but-beats-on-0-03-loss-per-share-5-6m-lumias-sold/\">loss-making</a> but strategic mapping asset, to shore up its financial position\u2026)</p><p>It\u2019s interesting, in any case, that Google and Waze have now kissed and made up. It was only in April that Bardin jabbed at Google when talking about who the big players in mapping were and how Waze stacks up against them: Waze used to benchmark itself with Google, he noted at the AllThingsD conference, but after the search giant cut off access to its API, Waze started to benchmark to Navteq.</p><p>When the Facebook acquisition reports surfaced, we\u2019d heard that one of the sticking points was that Waze wanted to keep its R&amp;D in Israel, while Facebook was leaning to a Menlo Park relocation. Since then, others have told us that this was just smoke a mirrors and that there were other reasons the deal fell through (Mountain View\u2019s most famous resident being one possible factor). Google, unlike Facebook, has a decent presence in the country, including a new hub for startups started in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/supporting-israels-start-up-nation.html\">December 2012</a>, Campus Tel Aviv.</p><p>Google today made it clear that it would keep Waze\u2019s operations going in Israel \u2014 for now, at least. \u201cThe Waze product development team will remain in Israel and operate separately for now,\u201d Brian McClendon, Google\u2019s VP of Geo, noted in the blog post announcing the deal. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the prospect of enhancing Google Maps with some of the traffic update features provided by Waze and enhancing Waze with Google\u2019s search capabilities.\u201d</p><p>In any case, it makes sense that Waze might want to keep its Israel-based operations intact. Just about all of the company\u2019s 110-or-so employees are there, with only around 10 in a very modest office in Palo Alto, just down the street from another big-data startup, Palantir. That small proportion, however, is mighty: regular workers there include CEO Noam Bardin and Di-Ann Eisnor, Waze\u2019s VP of platform and partnerships.</p><p>The U.S. is currently Waze\u2019s largest single market \u2014 in April, Bardin noted that 12 million of its (at the time) 44 million users are based there \u2014 and this is where the company is putting its growth efforts for now, too. In February of this year, Waze expanded its U.S. operations, and its monetization ambitions, by opening an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.waze.com/blog/start-spreading-the-news-waze-is-in-new-york-new-york/\">office on Madison Avenue</a>, the heart of the advertising world in New York City, and we\u2019ve seen that members of the team have been visiting New York recently. There is still a lot of development to be done on the advertising front \u2014 and given Google\u2019s pole position in online and mobile advertising, that would give Waze another obvious fit with its new owner.</p><p>Ironically, the news comes as Google continues to fight other kinds of fires on the mapping front. In the U.S. it is trying to get a ruling overturned that it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-10/google-seeks-ruling-street-view-didn-t-break-wiretap-laws.html/\">violated federal wiretap laws</a> with its StreetView services.</p><p>In Europe, Google recently offered up a settlement in a search antitrust suit, originally brought by travel and mapping companies, that claimed Google, the biggest search engine in Europe by a longshot, was giving its own mapping and travel results more preference in search results over those of its competitors, making business untenable for smaller players. In that ongoing case, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-28/world/39569963_1_google-maps-google-news-eu-commission/\">EU competition regulator Joachin Almunia</a> said at the end of May that Google still needed to make more concessions.</p>", "title": ["Google Bought Waze For $1.1B, Giving A Social Data Boost To Its Mapping Business"], "author": ["Ingrid Lunden"]},

What a difference a year can make. In what can be described as the Netscape moment for agriculture technology, the sector had a breakout year in 2014, receiving over<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://agfunder.com/reports/agtech-investing-report-2014\"> $2.36 billion of investment</a> across 264 deals spanning the agriculture value chain, according to data we pulled from CrunchBase as well as press releases and SEC filings for last year. Surprisingly, this $2.36 billion figure has now surpassed well-known sectors like fintech ($2.1 billion) and the former queen of green, cleantech ($2 billion).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to data from the<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cleantech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/i3QIM_AgricultureFood_4Q14.pdf\"> CleanTech Group</a>, investment in AgTech was relatively flat before 2013. Most tech innovation in agriculture was narrowly concentrated in biotechnology and seed genetics, and both investment and innovation was limited to players with close ties to the ag sector. Outside of seed genetics and crop inputs, most other AgTech was typically bundled with Cleantech.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Then, in 2013, there was a shift. AgTech grew 75 percent to reach $860 million across 119 deals. Taken together with our data (while recognizing our unique methodological approaches), AgTech subsequently grew 170 percent in 2014 and it\u2019s continued to show strong investment in early 2015.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"CToWUd a6T\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fps-_8k007p5syE9Itbc3G4R_k-5SM3MhtBrlheUQfYv3jLPoBpdphtnSkJoLiUxnsva0R9jweaDX5WCYMJIXQWEn2Y5uRCwWeN_RfSh1EAuOYV2xaQSBdzd1wcUhMSEeOGcPes\" alt=\"overview_1\" width=\"624px;\" height=\"428px;\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Advances from the mechanization in the 1920s and the Green Revolution from 1940-1960 have largely been exhausted. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article%3Fid%3D10.1371/journal.pone.0066428\">Rates of yield increases for major crops</a> have been trending negatively on a 10-year curve at the very time that global forces of population growth, prosperity, and globalization are putting basic supply-and-demand pressure on our agriculture system.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The population is growing at approximately 77.6 million per year, and it is expected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050. At the same time, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/middle-class-infographic\">the middle class is expected to double</a> by 2030. And as incomes rise people spend more on food (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engel%27s_law\">Engel\u2019s law</a>) and eat more animal protein (8 pounds of grains are needed for 1 pound of beef). To meet the demand for food, fuel and fiber from a growing and increasingly affluent population, experts predict that we will need to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article%3Fid%3D10.1371/journal.pone.0066428\">double global crop production</a> over the next 35 years.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With demand outstripping supply since the emergence of China starting in the mid 1990s, the agriculture sector has quietly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/21/business/economy/after-a-drought-agriculture-climbs.html\">outperformed all other sectors except for tech since 1999</a>. It\u2019s taken a while, but investors and entrepreneurs have started to take notice.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to secular trends driving the agriculture sector, the public at large is now better informed about the state of our food system and more concerned about the impact that agriculture has on the environment.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Agriculture now accounts for about 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/216137/icode/\">75 percent increase since 1990</a>, which makes agriculture a huge target for disruption. In addition, informed consumers are demanding locally grown, sustainable food with fewer chemicals, and the agriculture supply chain must evolve to deliver such products. This has created opportunities for a new generation of startups to gain a toehold into new markets that are too small for larger agriculture players.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, a confluence of hardware and software technology advances are creating opportunities to address this market. Inexpensive and infinitely configurable mobile devices (enabled by advances in wireless and energy storage) have liberated technology from the office desktop. At the same time, inexpensive but sophisticated hardware sensors have emerged to automate the collection of massive data sets.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">With these technology shifts, exciting technologies like drones, AI, satellite mapping, robotics, and the Internet of Things, have quickly realized that the agriculture value chain provides fertile first market opportunities for many technologies that are not advanced enough or have not yet found solutions in the consumer space. Many investors looking at these technologies are going to need to get smart on agriculture if they\u2019re going to make informed investment decisions.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Agriculture has a long value chain and the sector is often described as being more horizontal than vertical (we tracked 16 subcategories\u2014as diverse as biotech, food e-commerce, and smart equipment\u2014and 10 of these subsectors had more than 5 percent share of the AgTech market), and currently there is room for growth across the value chain. Already this year, we\u2019ve seen a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/26/3d-robotics-taps-qualcomm-for-50m-series-c-and-mobile-tech/\">$50M investment into drone maker 3D Robotics</a> and a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/20/planet-labs-95m/\">$95M investment into micro-satellite company Planet Labs</a>, both of which count agriculture as key early market opportunities.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Foodtech company Soylent <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/14/soylent-20m/\">raised $20 million</a> at a $100 million valuation, and plant trait company Arcadia BioSciences recently filed a $86 million IPO. And in what might seem like a jump-the-shark moment while still in the first inning, a company called FlowHive has emerged as the highest grossing campaign on Indiegogo, raising over $6.8 million for its honey-on-tap technology, already making it one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_funded_crowdfunding_projects\">top 10</a> crowdfunding campaigns of all time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"im\">\u00a0</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"CToWUd a6T\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/o2rW_E8UnPfjBy6EzAxN5oMNer53v-zu8M3xJI1if_lucbEwas3JDipXpOl1_4j3IewmW6LyCHXWmPdFJB4G1I46iOq2XP08Y0gQELe88UjqTZ9puFOZ0KneRzW7FhbB2iliw8A\" alt=\"investment_dollars_1\" width=\"624px;\" height=\"519px;\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"CToWUd a6T\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/z8exQI0M1FHSPHOvR3eEiHUTYPeP1iCWVTlef1Ae-Nf0hxBCJH6xbR1MrnFK8qm8eyhVIUDXFd8P9iORODkvAXpIFMM1jIyv-Ivmocssdbq5tpZSqc2VJyhnqo9vaHRycVZlTT0\" alt=\"deals_by_investor_3\" width=\"624px;\" height=\"607px;\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Like cleantech before it, many AgTech companies are have set their sights on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal\">Big Hairy Audacious Goals</a>. This is also a lure for investors who are attracted to companies looking to solve big problems with big market potential.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Agriculture accounts for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fao.org/nr/water/news/clim-change.html\">70% of freshwater withdrawals</a>, and under Byzantine water rights laws that date back to the 1820s there has been little incentive for farmers to manage this resource more sustainably. In response to the massive multi-year drought, AgTech companies are developing new solutions to use water more sustainably.<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bit.ly/swiim-systems\"> SWIIM</a>, a company that was recently named a partner for the White House\u2019s Climate Initiative, is developing the Airbnb for H20. It\u2019s hardware/software solution enables farmers to analyze every drop of water on their property, optimize its uses, and then rent out their surplus water needs to thirsty municipalities and industrials.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the other end of the spectrum,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hamptoncreek.com/\"> Hampton Creek</a>, a vegan mayonnaise company, is attempting to formulate an egg-less egg product. If Hampton Creek can create a palatable all-vegan egg, the product could have a disruptive effect on the $120 billion egg industry.Investors seem to think so, too\u2014the company took in $90M from the likes Silicon Valley heavyweights Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, Li-Kai Shing\u2019s Horizons Ventures, Jerry Yang (Yahoo), Marc Benioff (Salesforce), and Eduardo Saverin (Facebook).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And even further out there, New York-based<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/modern-meadow\"> Modern Meadow</a> is printing meat and leather products with 3D technology. Although 3D-printed meat may take a while to hit the market and win trust from consumers, Modern Meadow has an opportunity to take on the $54 billion leather market by cultivating cow-less leather from real cells. And unlike leather made from an animal, the process doesn\u2019t require any harsh chemical treatments.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This new generation of AgTech has only seen a few major liquidity events, and this will be a test for the industry in the years to come as investors assess their portfolios. In general, strategic acquisitions have largely been the path for liquidity for AgTech companies, but most of the incumbents have shown little appetite. While companies like John Deere and Syngenta have been mostly silent, Monsanto has decided not to wait for the competition. In 2011 Monsanto acquired Beelogics and Divergence; then in 2012 they acquired Precision Planting for $210M; and in 2013, Monsanto established Monsanto Ventures in San Francisco, and went on to acquire Agradis, GrassRoots, Rosetta Green ($35M), and Climate Corp. ($930M). As mentioned earlier, Climate Corp. has since been given access to Monsanto\u2019s checkbook and has been on an acquisition spree itself with other Silicon Valley startups like Farmers Edge following suit.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In several subsectors, notably food e-commerce and bioenergy, companies are reaching sizes where an IPO is within grasp, but for most of these subsectors, it\u2019s still too early to see the emergence of large AgTech companies. This will undoubtedly change over the next five years. The agriculture industry has historically sprouted large public corporations, and AgTech, still in its infancy, should be no different.</p>", "title": ["AgTech Is The New Queen Of Green"], "author": ["Rob Leclerc", "Melissa Tilney"]},

The database will be a living thing itself. If there is a breakdown in the process the combination of data-analysis and an ecosystem of gardeners should be able to correct the mishap, which in turn will lead to healthy growth,\u201d Erlick explains.</p><p>Luke Schantz, a New York tech evangelist formerly from the Blue Man Group, tells me\u00a0that future food grown in cities will need \u201cmassive networks of sensors for monitoring the environmental conditions. And, \u201cpossibly some modern robotic\u00a0scarecrows\u00a0to keep out the rats,\u00a0pigeons, squirrels and of course crows from feasting on or nesting in the urban agriculture.\u201d</p><p>How would he keep the hackers out?</p><p>System design.\u00a0The system could be decentralized.\u00a0Each node in the system could have solar energy panel, battery, on-board sensors and a micro-controller that reports data back to the system but does not require network connectivity or commands from a master control program to operate. So, if the servers are hacked or given a disruption of service attack, each node of the system will keep functioning on its own.</p><p>Data collection\u00a0could be done with a system like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.helium.com/\">Helium,</a>\u00a0where the reporting nodes are low-cost one-way radios.\u00a0If the system had a master control agent or message cue, blockchain could be used to ensure that the control network is not compromised or hacked.\u00a0This also could\u00a0be used in updating the programing on each node in the system. This would ensure that corrupted updates or viruses were distributed to the system nodes (as the Stuxnet virus was distributed to the Iranian centrifuges).</p><p>Avoid mono-cultures. It would be interesting to grow a wider variety of food types versus the mono-cultures of the [conventional] agro industry.

Some agtech user might have valuable data, such as secret grow recipes for unique strains of plants, user ID,\u00a0anonymity of the user or data on revenue-based ag-tech businesses.</p><p>If the above applies to your business,\u00a0what can be done to protect yourself?</p><p>Yifrach suggests to \u201chire a full-time experienced hacker in your team who will conduct constant monitoring and pen-testing (penetration testing) of your system and periodically patch if required.

At the time, Wibbitz reported having 1,600 sites which had been testing a more basic form of the service during a private beta period. Today, the company says that more than 20,000 sites have now generated videos using the version of Wibbitz that was launched that fall.</p><p>To implement Wibbitz on their websites, publishers only need to add a single line of JavaScript code. Once implemented, Wibbitz takes the article\u2019s text and creates a video summary using images from its own library or a public image bank on the web where images\u00a0licensed under\u00a0Creative Commons (i.e., OK for re-use) are available. Unlike many automated solutions, the end product does not sound all that robotic.</p><p>The video can be shared by viewers to Facebook and Twitter or it can embedded elsewhere on the web. Because the videos are created with HTML5, they work in any modern browser on PCs, Macs, smartphones or tablets.</p><p>Since the launch of its new player, Wibbitz has improved upon its video creation methods and algorithms, and has introduced a one-click solution for creating videos. The company is now working on a premium publisher solution which will allow any publisher to create video content in a scalable manner. \u201cSeveral brand name players\u201d are on board, says Dayan.</p><p>But Wibbitz isn\u2019t just about content summaries, it\u2019s about monetizing text content in new ways. The service allows publishers monetize their videos through pre-roll advertising. When asked how that was going, Wibbitz co-founder and CEO Zohar Dayan said \u201ctraction is very high and is growing at a very impressive rate on a daily basis.\u201d He declined to offer specific numbers on advertising metrics on the split between the free and premium (paying) users on Wibbitz, however. But given the new funding, there must be something there to pique investors\u2019 interest.</p><p>With the infusion of new capital, Dayan says that the team will further the commercialization of the technology, will expand its R&amp;D in Israel and will open offices in NYC.</p>", "title": ["Wibbitz Raises $2.3M Series A For Technology That Turns Text Into Videos"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

Last year, the company picked up a Series A round of <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/05/wibbitz-raises-2-3m-series-a-for-technology-that-turns-text-into-videos/\">$2.3 million</a> from Horizons, Initial Capital and lool Ventures and launched as a web-based service aimed mainly at enterprises, with some 50,000 sites taking up the service and generating close to 20 million video views each month.</p><p>If you go back to that news from a year ago, you will see how the app used to look, and it provides a useful marker show just how far it\u2019s come along, in its first major update since that funding was announced. </p><p>Today, as you can see in the video below, there are significantly more dynamic video clips, infographics and an overall smoother look to the product. Zohar Dayan, the CEO and co-founder of the company, says that Wibbitz has been working on the product you see today for over two years. \u201cA lot of core technology and machine learning created by some very talented people went into this,\u201d he says. </p><p>And the mobile app is just the beginning: \u201cRight now we\u2019re focusing on mobile, where reading text is difficult on a small screen. We see the most potential and highest need there,\u201d he says. But he says that Wibbitz \u201calso sees pain in smart TVs as well.\u201d As more web content makes its way to bigger screens, he says, it can be just as difficult to read that as it is on small screens: \u201cReading text articles on TVs is impossible,\u201d he says.</p><p>Launching a consumer app does not mean that Wibbitz is abandoning its B2B prospects, either. In a \u201cstage two\u201d in a few months time, Dayan says that it will be releasing the technology as an embedded service on third-party apps. One of the first that will use this is the Telegraph newspaper in the UK. </p><p>It is also in the process of raising another round of financing to keep moving ahead with its bigger plans to move away from text in places where it may be too challenging to read.</p><p>A demo of how Wibbitz looks today is embedded here:</p><p></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/69117494\">Wibbitz \u2013 Your News in Motion</a> from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/wibbitz\">Wibbitz</a> on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>", "title": ["With Echoes Of Summly And Siri, Wibbitz Relaunches Its Text-To-Video Service As A Consumer App"], "author": ["Ingrid Lunden"]},

With more than four floors and 7,300 square feet of space, the building has 19 private bedrooms costing anywhere from $1,800 to $1,950. Along with the private rooms, comes four communal kitchens, a large dining room, work space and a roof deck.</p><p>The Common opening comes at a time when venture-backed companies like WeWork are piling into co-living as a way to use urban residential space more cost-efficiently and to attract Millennials, who are delaying marriage and families later and later. In New York, older tenant laws control the number of tenants that can be listed on a lease, and brokers often charge upwards of a month\u2019s rent to find apartments. That makes it difficult for newcomers to find housing easily compared to other American cities. On the property owner side, Common\u2019s pitch is that they can partner to purchase whole vacant buildings and turn them into stable, market-rate income streams while removing the hassles of leasing and property management.</p><p>Over the summer, Common partnered with a local New York City real estate developer to buy Crown Heights building earlier this year. They invested a little less than $1 million in re-modeling the space.</p><p>They kept four suites or units in tact, but opened up large dining and work areas. \u201cThe whole idea here is is to use common areas and activate typically under-utilized space,\u201d Hargreaves told me in a video tour via Skype.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1225653 size-large\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/living-room-51.jpg?w=680&amp;h=510\" alt=\"Hargreaves said he wanted a Hudson Valley Americana feel.\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\"></p><p>Common built in several smart phone features like Bluetooth door locks compatible with keycards, phones and the Apple watch, and Nest thermostats. Through Hargreaves\u2019 connections, they added mattresses from the startup Casper, along with furniture from Restoration Hardware and West Elm.</p><p>\u201cAesthetically, I would say it\u2019s mid-century Modern with some Hudson Valley Americana built into it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to evoke the neighborhood as well. A lot of the art is from Crown Heights and the furniture are things you would find in a traditional Brownstone.\u201d</p><p>Services include free laundry, regular deliveries of coffee, tea and paper towels, and weekly cleanings in bathrooms and common areas. Utilities and wi-fi is baked into the price.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1225656 size-large\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/common-space-12.jpg?w=680&amp;h=455\" alt=\"Common Space 1\" width=\"680\" height=\"455\"></p><p>For the communal element, Common is bringing in Sunday potlucks and other kinds of event programming. He partnered with his old General Assembly co-founder Matthew Brimer, who went on to create the morning dance party Daybreaker. They\u2019re bringing in Common residents to the next one. Hargreaves declined to share anything about the socioeconomic make-up of the residents, saying that he wanted residents to speak for themselves after they move in. Crown Heights is a majority black neighborhood, that has seen its African-American share of the population decline <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/realestate/crown-heights-brooklyn-where-stoop-life-still-thrives.html\">from 79 percent to 70 percent between 2000 and 2010. </a></p><p>About 250 people have applied for the 19 available Common spots so far in the neighborhood.</p><p>Some journalists have been critical of the co-living business model, with Buzzfeed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/nitashatiku/silicon-valley-coliving#.yrW7Orle7Z\">calling it the latest way to \u201cmonetize the wantrepreneur lifestyle.\u201d</a></p><p>But this is a narrow interpretation of what is happening in urban housing markets in the United States.</p><p>Co-living, or co-housing, is the reincarnation of a very old idea. From the Industrial Revolution onward, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6j49p0wf;brand=ucpress\">residential hotels, or buildings with month-to-month tenancy and no in-unit kitchens, were a major part of American urban living in the late 19th and early 20th century</a>. They served a wide range of price tiers from luxury palace hotels on down through middle-income residential hotels and then into lower-income lodging houses and tenements. They were a response to overwhelming population growth stimulated by the Industrial Revolution, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/table-4.pdf\">when the American population went from being 25.6 percent rural in 1870 to 51.2 percent urban in 1920.</a> In San Francisco, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft6j49p0wf&amp;chunk.id=d0e1424&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e1424&amp;brand=ucpress\">residential hotels went from serving 1/16th of the city population in 1880 to 1 out of every 10 people by 1910</a>. They later fell out of favor as the American middle-class left for the suburbs in the mid-20th century, turning residential hotels into the housing choice of last resort for the poor left behind in the urban core.</p><p>Today, coastal cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco are growing once again, with an upward trend in population growth over three-and-a-half decades since 1980. This resurgence is putting an immense amount of pressure on inner-city neighborhoods that is obvious in gentrification battles from Brooklyn to the Mission District and on into Oakland.</p><p>Unless low-rise, suburban areas ringing the urban core step up and add housing and unless cities start scrutinizing the higher-end of the market where external capital is sitting in vacant units as pure investment rather than shelter, there will be an extraordinary amount of pressure to make urban residential space more efficient. At the same time, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/nicktimiraos/status/633635190426963968\">housing starts have been extremely slow into this economic recovery</a> because of the hangover left after the last financial crisis \u2014 which was housing centric. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-housing-starts-rose-9-8-in-june-1437136432\">Multi-family development and apartment buildings are leading the way</a>, but federal housing policies and local zoning rules still favor single-family detached homes even though the pressure is for entire metropolitan regions to densify.</p><p>The entrepreneurial response to these pressures could take the form of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/09/09/san-francisco-mission-district-rentals-bunkbeds-vinyasa-homes-project/\">more unscrupulous hacker hotels with $1,800 bunkbeds</a>, or it can go in the direction of micro-units and other kinds of communal living.</p><p>As was true during the suburban tract home era, housing can take many forms from cheap, speculative development to more intentional design.\u00a0Hargreaves is hoping to grab the middle to upper-middle segment of the market.</p><p>This is a risky business considering the amount of upfront capital that is necessary\u00a0to compete in real estate markets. Earlier this year, San Francisco-based Campus went under as\u00a0the unit economics on most of its properties were upside down. They could only make profit on houses\u00a0that had more than eight or nine rooms. Still, the company managed to wind down the company by turning over master leases to the majority of its tenants, keeping the startup\u2019s customers housed even as the startup went out of business.</p><p>WeWork has also been expected to enter the\u00a0space with a WeLive product, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/nitashatiku/how-wework-convinced-investors-its-worth-billions#.iulJXOjZJn\">which it projected to bring in $605.9 million in revenue three years after launch in a leaked investor slide deck published by Buzzfeed.</a> It has been working on a large building in Crystal City in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area.</p><p>For now, Hargreaves is focused on New York City with two buildings slated for opening in Brooklyn.<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/16/common-hargreaves/\">He has raised about $7.35 million from Maveron and other investors this year.</a></p>", "title": ["Common, The Co-Living Startup From A General Assembly Founder, Opens Its First Building in Brooklyn"], "author": ["Kim-Mai Cutler"]},

With Android M, which Google announced today, the Now service is getting even smarter and more contextual. When you tap and hold the home button in Android M, Google will grab the information from the application you are using at that moment and Now will try to give you the right contextual information about what you are\u00a0looking at\u00a0in that app. Google Calls This \u2018<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2015/05/now-on-tap.html\">Google Now on Tap</a>.\u2019</p><p>As Google\u2019s VP of Products Sundar Pichai noted in today\u2019s keynote, this is really an extension of Google\u2019s overall search strategy and the result of its efforts around machine learning and deep neural networks to help computers understand more about the world around them.</p><p>You can also invoke this feature by saying \u201cOk Google\u201d at any time and then ask a question related to the app you are looking at, or by tapping on a word in an article you are reading, too.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1162152\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screenshot-2015-05-26-at-14-50-02.png?w=1024&amp;h=789\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-05-26 at 14.50.02\" width=\"1024\" height=\"789\"></p><p>Here is how this works in practice. Say you are playing a song in Spotify. Tapping and holding the home button will bring up more info about the song you are looking at. But you can also do a voice query and ask: \u201cWho is the lead singer?\u201d Google Now already knows what song is playing and using data from the Knowledge Graph project \u2014 it can (hopefully) answer your questions.</p><p>Similarly, this service can work its magic from Hangouts, for example. Say you are discussing \u201cthe new George Clooney movie\u201d with a friend. Bringing up Now On Tap will give you more information about Tomorrowland, because Google knows that\u2019s what you are talking about. Some of the information you can expect to see are movie times, reviews and maybe more information about the actors in the film. Because of Google\u2019s App Indexing project, it can also recommend related applications (maybe IMDB or Flixster) and deep links into them (if you have them installed). If your friend had asked you to remember to buy tickets for the movie, Google Now would also have popped up a box to set a reminder for you.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1164125\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/google-io-20150157.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" alt=\"google-io-20150157\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><p>Google Now on Tap uses a couple of built-in operating system-level features from Android M, so this service won\u2019t come to older Android versions. The reason for this, Google Director of Product Management Aparna Chennapragada tells me, is that this is the only way to make sure that this service\u00a0works with\u00a0any application.</p><p>Developers\u00a0won\u2019t have to do anything to enable this feature in their apps. The platform API will simply handle all of this for them. If they want to, though, they can add some specific metadata to their apps to help Google figure out what exactly is happening in the app. This means a game developer could add information about what level you are on, for example, and Now on tap can then pop up relevant info about that level. Without the metadata, Google wouldn\u2019t be able to easily get this information from the game, after all.</p><p>Chennapragada tells me that all of this happens on an opt-in basis. You have to enable this feature in Google Now and then the only time you exchange information with Google is when you actually do the \u2018tab and hold\u2019 gesture. No data is copied between your app and Google until you ask it to do so.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/io2015/\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/io2015-banner.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>", "title": ["Android M Will Be Able To Give You Contextual Info About What\u2019s Happening In Your Android Apps"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},

For top stories, videos now feature narration by an actual person, making for a much better listening experience compared to the app\u2019s computer-generated audio, which kind of sounds like an old version of the Windows Narrator voice. And as part of its new responsive design, videos are less cluttered with huge numbers on mobile every time some figure is mentioned in a story.</p><p>My personal wish list for the app is rather short at this point. I\u2019d like the ability to save videos for offline viewing so I can watch a few during the minutes my BART train is under the bay during my morning commute. Along with the video and text summaries of articles, I\u2019d also like an audio format, so that I can use it to quickly catch up on national news while exercising.

This means that you do not need to have the app to view the document, or even to edit it if you are on a desktop. (Mobile, Taylor says, is different, because , although you need to have it if you want to make any edits. Taylor says that\u2019s because some mobile browsers have technical limitations. \u201cAndroid browsers are widely varying in quality so we didn\u2019t think they could provide a consistent experience,\u201d he says.</p><p><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/1-quip-publish-link.png?w=1024&amp;h=727\" alt=\"1-Quip-Publish-Link\" width=\"1024\" height=\"727\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009012\"></p><p>One of the keys to how Quip has designed its shared documents is that they put publishing into the foreground. \u201cRead only basically hides the app,\u201d says Taylor, \u201cso that it looks like a pristine document, with beautiful typography. You can write and publish it to the world with the push of a button.\u201d </p><p>This is clearly not just an aesthetic move but a bid to see just how far Quip might progress as an app. Right now, Taylor says that at companies like Facebook, Quip is used to share checklists and come up with agendas for meetings \u2014 \u201creplacing the white boards that are in the center of all the workspaces,\u201d he says. But now, the new look of the shared documents is an attempt to send out a different, and possibly more public kind of message.</p><p>\u201cYou can write and publish your document to the world with the push of a button,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that will be used broadly but with the growth of social networks like Facebook and Twitter people are choosing to publish in different places and using social networks as a distribution channel. We\u2019re one of the few apps with a nice mobile editing experience to help do that.\u201d</p><p><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/quip-search-operators-cropped.png?w=328&amp;h=680\" alt=\"Quip-Search-Operators cropped\" width=\"328\" height=\"680\" class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-1009011\">The search engine, meanwhile, will give users the ability to search within documents, as well as provide more buttons to users to automate the kinds of searches they may want to do \u2014 creating buttons for so-called \u201csearch operators\u201d like \u201cfrom:\u201d. The impetus here were the limitations of the keyboards on most mobile handsets, he says. \u201cWe felt on mobile search if you have ever tried to do an advanced search, you have to go through to different keyboards to get colons, for example. So we wanted to build a search engine that was inspired by gmail but make it work better on mobile.\u201d On top of that the searches now autocomplete by most-frequently tagged contacts when you start to type them. </p><p>Interestingly, for a startup that is intent on disrupting established practices, Quip stops short of certain innovations. While it makes use of the voice recognition features already built into devices for purposes of composing, this is not a part of the wider app. \u201cI\u2019m a contrarian with voice recognition,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be the primary way to interact because of crowded urban areas. You just can\u2019t talk around other people in the same way. I think voice is important in the car but I think that in a lot of the places where we are getting work done, voice is just not the best interface.\u201d He does acknowledge that \u201ca lot of R&amp;D in this area\u201d could change that. More immediately, he says, \u201cfiguring out what the right keyboard will be for tablets is is something that I am most excited about.\u201d</p><p>Taylor tells me that Quip\u2019s bigger competitors in the space are two of the services that are largely in use today \u2014 the document reader and writer and Google Apps, and Microsoft Word. For those that need or want to work on mobile devices, though, his new app has some significant advantages, he says. \u201cMicrosoft Office is exceptional for individual users and working offline on the desktop version,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Word is not good for collaboration, with most document sharing happening as attachments to email. Most just go straight to email and skip Word altogether.\u201d</p><p>And as for Google Apps (Taylor is also an ex-Googler, like Gibbs), he says it\u2019s also from another era, albeit a slightly later one. \u201cMost of Google Apps was born in the era of the web browser, and it\u2019s made an awkward transition to mobile.\u201d Taylor\u2019s awkward list includes clunky collaboration features, and its offline support, which requires a user to mark documents for offline use before you, say, get on an airplane.  </p><p>Of course, these two are not the only pieces of software in the very crowded market of document creation. Evernote, coming from a starting point of taking personal notes, also offers collaboration and sharing features; and more web-based platforms like WordPress are also potential candidates for those who want to create and share writing or other documents. And there are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/search?submit=edit&amp;term=word%20processing#song\">many more</a>. In short, it\u2019s a crowded market for Quip. </p><p>This is where Quip\u2019s other approach to growth comes in: adoption and engagement. Taylor calls low engagement \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d whenever you talk to enterprises and their IT landscape. \u201cThey have a graveyard of unused collaboration tools, like the Wiki that no one updates,\u201d he says. The idea here is that Quip is borrowing a page from the consumerization playbook: making the product as beautiful and as easy to use as a consumer app will make it more used. He says that so far, with the 5,000 companies that have picked up Quip, this has been bearing out. </p><p>Taylor would not say exactly how many users in total are on Quip among those 5,000 companies, or how much it is making today in revenues. But it is enough that Quip is not looking to raise any more money at the moment on top of the $15 million Series A led by Benchmark that it picked up before launch.</p><p>\u201cWe are earning revenue from our customers and we are not looking to raise money,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we are not giving out revenue numbers because we don\u2019t want that kind of scrutiny right now.\u201d Typically, companies pay $12/user/month and sign up for either a six-month or 12-month contract, based on actual users, not company size.</p>", "title": ["In A Bid To Be The MS Word Of The Mobile Generation, Quip Adds Better Search, URL Links"], "author": ["Ingrid Lunden"]},

When I was in school (old person voice), Apple had a huge presence by doing educational partnerships which was ridiculously smart for branding. The hope was that kids would go home and beg mom and dad to get an Apple computer just like they used in school.

But he won\u2019t be alone. Instead, Kelly is bringing Watson along with him.</p><p>Watson is an IBM project that answers questions using artificial intelligence to accept and process\u00a0natural language queries. It became known to the public for its exploits in the Jeopardy game show, if you recall.</p><p>IBM\u2019s ambition for Watson is not small. In early 2014, its parent corporation formed the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/42867.wss\">IBM Watson Group</a> in New York with several thousand denizens. At the time, IBM pledged $1 billion to the group, while announcing a number of new Watson capabilities, including a tool to accelerate research and a service\u00a0to visualize \u201cbig data insights,\u201d to quote its own language.</p><p>Component to the $1 billion pledge was a $100 million venture fund, designed to encourage startups to leverage Watson technology. It will be interesting to hear how well that effort has gone: Are any Watson-focused startups unicorns?</p><p>Watson learns first by\u00a0being fed large amounts of domain information \u2014 a \u201ccorpus\u201d in IBM\u2019s parlance. It is then\u00a0trained with\u00a0various intra-domain question pairs, helped by\u00a0human experts. After enough training, Watson continues to refine\u00a0its understanding and answer questions about the domain itself.</p><p>IBM is rapidly building out Watson\u2019s capabilities. Listed on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/\">Watson Developer Cloud page</a> are services like \u201clanguage translation,\u201d and \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://watson-pi-demo.mybluemix.net/\">personality insights</a>,\u201d\u00a0which I recommend playing with. On the same page, IBM notes that \u201cconcept expansion,\u201d \u201crelationship extraction,\u201d and \u201cquestion and answer\u201d are all currently in beta.</p><p>In short, IBM has big plans for Watson, which, through its Developer Cloud service, fits into IBM\u2019s broader cloud push.

I was amazed by the inventions of mere mortals, and wondered if there was some sort of genetic mutation that allowed a select few to see the future more clearly than the rest of us. Secretly, I hoped to be a visionary someday.</p><p>I\u2019ve been blessed to work side-by-side with a couple of <span class=\"il\">visionaries</span> in my career. <span class=\"il\">Ken</span> <span class=\"il\">Williams</span>, founder of Sierra Online, created the first graphical PC game, Mystery House, in 1979. <span class=\"il\">George</span> <span class=\"il\">Lucas</span> not only created Star Wars, but also what is now Pixar, THX, AVID and many more. Both are widely recognized as <span class=\"il\">visionaries</span>.</p><p>Both men are wicked smart and naturally curious, two characteristics often attributed to <span class=\"il\">visionaries</span>. What people often miss, however, is that they are both brilliant businessmen. They understand you can have too much vision, seeing a far-off future that won\u2019t come true within the right time frame. As an entrepreneur, the challenge is funding from where you are today until enough customers agree with your vision that they pay for your expenses. You need to know where you are on the vision timeline.</p><p><span class=\"il\">Ken</span> <span class=\"il\">Williams</span> decided to sell Sierra Online to CUC International in 1996. By 1997, neither of us could stand our new boss, so we quit. We spent the summer of 1997 brainstorming ideas for a new company and finally settled on Digital Storage, Inc. The basic idea was to convert all your major life moments to digital and preserve them forever, even allowing you to assign digital heirs.</p><p>We both were 100 percent convinced it would be a huge business someday, but we were concerned we might be too early. Rather than spend millions of dollars building the service, we decided to spend about $50,000 on focus groups, cold-calling potential customers and\u00a0a half-page color ad in USA Today advertising our service. After three months of effort only one person signed up. Our vision may have been right, but our timing was off \u2014 we were way too early.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2008 when I started working with <span class=\"il\">George</span> <span class=\"il\">Lucas</span> and Lucasfilm as a board member and advisor. <span class=\"il\">George</span> carried a laminated card in his wallet of ideas he had for future products. One of those ideas was G-Whiz.</p><p>A challenge all directors face is going from 2D storyboards to shooting a scene on an unfamiliar location selected by a scout. Figuring out in real time where to place the cameras, actors, mics, props and crew when the location didn\u2019t match the storyboard was time-consuming and expensive. He knew ILM had a huge library of props and characters and could generate a life-like model of a set, but he couldn\u2019t explore it in real time.</p><p>While visiting LucasArts and watching them build levels in real time on a PlayStation 2, George started thinking about how to merge the game-builder\u2019s ability to create a level in real time with the director\u2019s need to create a set immediately. He\u00a0also was watching the progress\u00a0Lucasfilm R&amp;D (now <span class=\"il\">Lucas</span> Labs) was making with real-time compositing. Live <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://t.sidekickopen20.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs2zhDsPW5wLKGn2zhwm0N5CVhVp1dYLpf84jWpl03?t=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F7T9Dv1aLMbw&amp;si=5281497812828160&amp;pi=440033e0-6e39-4de6-c0a9-eed78f8499ca\">actors could walk around a completely empty green screen</a> set while the director could see them in real time on the CG set, in costume with a chunk of 2\u00d74 transformed into a blaster.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"il\">George</span> acutely understood the challenges facing directors, but he had access to technology and research that most people never would see. I believe that enabled him to crystallize a vision for G-Whiz that would have taken anyone else years longer to develop. He also had the patience (and money) to slowly bring his vision to life as the movie industry transitioned from analog film to digital. The vision was important, but so was the timeline.</p><p>So why write an article about vision for a tech blog? I believe we are farther along the timeline for apps based on open standards than most <span class=\"il\">visionaries</span> are predicting today. Wait! Before you quit reading and jump straight to the comments to explain to me in technical terms why I\u2019m wrong, please understand I\u2019m going to present a business case for open technologies.</p><p>From a business perspective, I\u2019ve seen Act I of this play during the flip-phone era. Back then, I was COO in charge of development at EA Canada; one of our most popular games was FIFA. In 2003, we released it for mobile phone at a cost of X. Over the next three years, as flip-phone sales exploded, we had to support Java, Brew, Symbian, Blackberry and Windows Mobile. Our cost to develop FIFA on mobile was nearly 2X, but revenue growth was much less. The demand for people who wanted to play FIFA on their phone was relatively static, but they wanted to play it on their favorite phone. That was our (very expensive) problem to solve.</p><p>Today we have smartphones, tablets, wearables, TVs and Internet of Things to support. It is simply not profitable for brands and IT departments to create native app versions for all these devices running a plethora of operating systems (and don\u2019t even get me started about Android being consistently lumped together as if it were a single OS to support).</p><p><span class=\"il\">Ken</span> <span class=\"il\">Williams</span> and <span class=\"il\">George</span> <span class=\"il\">Lucas</span> could see things others couldn\u2019t yet because of their vantage points in their industries. Who has that perspective today? I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s the people who are in corporate IT management roles who can see that the proliferation of browsers and devices is moving us toward a breaking point for the native app-centric model.</p><p>The extreme popularity and growth of smart devices over the past seven years, along with a growing economy, has masked the underlying business problem. Corporate IT departments were the first to realize this, and have aggressively been engaging \u201ccreate once, run anywhere\u201d solutions from Kony, Sencha and others.</p><p>Corporations spend twice as much money ($40 billion) on \u201cin-house\u201d apps as consumers do in the Apple, Google and Microsoft stores combined, and they don\u2019t care or need distribution by Google, Apple or Microsoft\u2019s store. They have a captive audience and they know how to reach every single one of them. They are embracing open standards, including HTML5. When that isn\u2019t feasible, such as needing direct access to a hardware sensor, they use hybrid apps where the native app functionality is scarcely more than a wrapper. Developing native apps for a half-dozen different operating systems is a last resort, and one that increasingly doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s time for an alternative.</p><p>What\u2019s the alternative? Ask those with the industry vantage point and they will tell you the native app model is already starting to fail. They\u2019ll point to a future where something like \u201con-demand apps,\u201d as I call them, work on every device and can be centrally managed by the corporation without going through a proprietary app store. This will seem unrealistic to some, just as walking around a virtual set in real time seemed impossible to most a decade ago. They were right \u2014 at the time. And then, suddenly, they were wrong. I believe we\u2019ll see the same thing happen with corporate apps (and then many consumer-facing apps).</p><p><span class=\"il\">Visionaries</span> benefit from perspective and experiences not readily accessible to most of us. Sometimes, to be a visionary, you need to find a vantage point that allows you to see just a little further than everyone else. From where I stand\u00a0\u2014 with a history in creating content for an ever-increasing variety of platforms\u00a0\u2014 I believe the shift to on-demand content that works across all browsers is happening right now.</p>", "title": ["George Lucas, Ken Williams And The Practical Magic Of Pragmatic Visionaries"], "author": ["Jerry Bowerman"]},

It\u2019s\u00a0becoming a data-driven world. We are awash in data, but the problem is figuring out what we are supposed to do with it.</p><p>Salesforce wants to be the center of your data-driven customer strategy, of course. To that end, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/15/salesforce-announces-new-internet-of-things-cloud-as-dreamforce-opens/\">the company introduced the Internet of Things Cloud</a> last week, which is supposed to pull in data from devices, sensors and non-IoT sources like app behavior and social streams. In Salesforce\u2019s view, it\u2019s all in the service of the customer, grabbing\u00a0data and wrapping a rules engine around it to drive automated actions for the customer.</p><p>Salesforce isn\u2019t the only company recognizing the power of data. Whether it\u2019s predictive analytics to drive better sales results, IBM\u2019s Watson to help doctors analyze a patient record and compare it against the medical journal literature, or Okta and Yammer using data to drive their development decisions.</p><p>In fact a couple of weeks ago, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/20/okta-customer-research-finds-office-365-most-used-app/\">Okta released a report on cloud usage</a> derived from data that comes through their networks, recognizing what many companies have, data is increasingly a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/22/actually-every-company-is-a-big-data-company/\">useful byproduct of simply doing business</a>.</p><p>Many companies are being built by gathering\u00a0data, to the point they get a network effect as they grow. The more\u00a0customers using the software, the more data they gather, the better the product should be.</p><p>Data has the power to change the way we do business, helping make better predictions\u00a0and enabling better, more forward-looking decision making (and better products and services) \u2014 at least that\u2019s the theory.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2015/09/18/microsoft-salesforce-are-dreamforce-besties/\">In an on-stage interview at Dreamforce</a>, \u00a0Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella talked about the power of data-driven decision making and how he saw Microsoft\u2019s role in all that. \u201cWe are building out this intelligent cloud to harness the data asset and convert it into intelligence to empower the intelligence around us,\u201d he said.</p><p>It\u2019s about making computing more natural. In Nadella\u2019s ideal world, computing will be ambient and everywhere. But it\u2019s not there yet. As though to prove how fragile the technology still is, Nadella tried to do a data demo using\u00a0the Cortana voice recognition system, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-satya-nadella-cortana-failure-2015-9\">and it simply didn\u2019t work for him</a>.</p><p>But companies like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.infer.com/\">Infer</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.insidesales.com/\">InsideSales</a>, both of whom I spoke to at Dreamforce, are trying to focus on using a set of signals from various sources to direct\u00a0the sales process to the most promising prospects using data. Since it isn\u2019t trying to boil the ocean, perhaps it\u2019s a bit easier to make use of the data \u2014 and both companies appear to be having some success.</p><p>The really tough thing though is taking the growing body of unstructured data, that is data that isn\u2019t stored in a database somewhere, and making sense of it. That\u2019s the problem\u00a0IBM Watson, The Cortana Analytics Suite and others are trying to solve.</p><p>The idea says IBM is harnessing that information, reasoning about what it means and utilizing where it makes most sense to drive more sensible decision-making using the strength of the machine to help humans work more intelligently.</p><p>In theory all that data is going to produce\u00a0a data-driven resolution, but in reality, figuring out how to deal with that data is hard work. Companies like Microsoft and Salesforce are hoping to simplify it, but customers don\u2019t always buy the line they are selling.</p><p>At the Satya Nadella interview/demo, he was trying to show how data when fed through the Cortana Analytics Suite could help provide a more coherent\u00a0information flow if you simply query the data and ask the right questions, but\u00a0one guy near me put it in perspective\u00a0when he complained:</p><p>\u201cThere is the\u00a0universe of data. How am I supposed to make sense of it? If I\u2019m given a world of data, it\u2019s too much for me, and Nadella wants me asking questions. How do I even know what questions I should be asking?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a big issue\u00a0for people, and it requires systems of insight, says George Colony, CEO at Forrester, something that\u00a0we are just beginning to understand. \u201cImagine a world where every Coke bottle sends data. Imagine the amount of data in real time that is hitting Coke second by second,\u201d he said.</p><p>He calls the Salesforce IoT Cloud, \u2018a crude system of insight.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to show the data visually. It\u2019s difficult to correlate, but it\u2019s at least a step in the right direction,\u201d he said.</p><p>Companies need systems which are able to explain large volumes of complex data, but we just aren\u2019t there yet, Colony explained. Ideally, the machine should be doing most of that heavy lifting for us, learning what types of information interest us and surfacing the data that matters most \u2014 but in reality we are a long way from that ideal.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sitting around camp fires chewing on bones. That\u2019s not a knock [on current technology]. It\u2019s just early,\u201d Colony said.</p><p>And that\u2019s the challenge. We know that when presented with a body of data, it should help us work smarter, but the reality\u00a0is that it\u2019s harder than it looks, and the tools and technologies we have in place to attack it, while incredible pieces of technology, have for the most part not allowed average business users to make that leap.</p><p>\u201cWe need systems which are able to explain large volumes of complex data to [non-technical]\u00a0executives\u00a0coherently,\u201d Colony explained. And we just aren\u2019t there yet.</p>", "title": ["Data Driven Everything Remains Elusive"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},
{"date": ["2015-10-14"], "text": "<p>Pirate3D Inc raised nearly $1.5M on Kickstarter in 2013, promising a 3D printer that anyone can use. A total of 3,520 backers pledged money to the project including 3,389 who pledged over $300 to eventually get a printer. But as of now, 60 percent\u00a0of the orders have still not been\u00a0fulfilled and it seems unlikely that in the end backers will get a refund or their product.</p><p>In a convoluted note to backers (below), the company\u2019s founder states that the company is exploring raising additional capital yet seems to say it does not expect to be able to fulfill the remaining Kickstarter orders even with additional cash.</p><p>This is why we cannot have nice things.</p><p>Investing is a risky business. Not everything pans out. No matter how it\u2019s billed, crowdfunding through sites like Kickstarter, Indiegogo and GoFundMe is an investing scheme and carries unexpected risks for the general consumer.</p><p>Crowdfunding removes barriers and makes it easier to get products into production. And that\u2019s great. Raising money needed to get a product from an idea to a product is hard and takes a lot of time. But often over the course of fundraising and moving things into production, issues arise and are addressed before promises are made to consumers. With crowdfunding,\u00a0promises are made before the challenges are known.</p><p>The Pirate3D Buccaneer raised a blockbuster $1.438M on June 29, 2013 \u2014 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.3ders.org/articles/20130630-pirate3d-printer-raises-on-kickstarter-exceeding-goal-by-14x.html\">a record amount at the time</a>. The first printers were supposed to ship to backers in February 2014. That didn\u2019t happen. As of September 2014, only 200 products had shipped. And a year later, despite selling the product through retail channels, 60% of backers are still waiting.</p><p>Sometimes Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects fail. There\u2019s risk associated with crowdfunding. Pledging money towards a project is not a guarantee that the project will be fulfilled as promised. Kickstarter changed its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/terms-of-use\">terms of service last October</a> to give project creators a way out of fulfilling their obligations as long as certain criteria had been meet including posting a report showing how funds were used and stating what is preventing the project from finishing as planned. But that terms of use only applies to project that launched after October 17, 2014. Pirate3D\u2019s Buccaneer printer was funded the previous year and subject to a different set of rules.</p><p>Pirate3D must fulfill its orders or issue a refund, according to Kickstarter\u2019s terms of use agreed by the company. It\u2019s cut and dried. If neither conditions are met, backers have the right to sue the creator, according to a conversation I had with a Kickstarter representative.</p><p>The Pirate3D founders did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment. [<strong>Update</strong>: After the article was published the founders returned my email and stated that they still on plan on fulfilling the Kickstarter orders. When? They didn\u2019t say.]</p><p>This black and white policy is what caused Kickstarter to craft a new set of terms of use that gives project creators a backdoor out of their obligations. Simply put, sometimes things do not work out. And it seems like that\u2019s the case with the Pirate3D Buccaneer Printer.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/unnamed3.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1223597\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/unnamed3.png?w=300\" alt=\"\"></a>From what I can tell the founders and employees of Pirate3D didn\u2019t set out to scam customers. They produced an amazing product. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/12/a-review-of-the-dead-simple-pirate3d-buccaneer-3d-printer/\">I reviewed a Buccaneer printer and found it a joy to use</a>. It\u2019s truly a fantastic home 3D printer. The founders simply failed at building a viable company around the product.</p><p>The founders said in a note to Kickstarter backers that the company is sourcing new rounds of investment and found that investors want the new cash to only be used as working capital and not to fulfill previous obligations. TechCrunch also received communication from Pirate3D noting that the company is already looking at a deal.</p><p>Kickstarter monitors submissions and leans on its vast community to flag projects that do not abide by the site\u2019s terms of service \u2014 like a facial razor that uses lasers. The Skarp netted over $4 million on Kickstarter but was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skarp/the-skarp-laser-razor-21st-century-shaving\">pulled from the site</a> after the creator failed to provide suitable imagery. The Skarp quickly made its way to Kickstarter-competitor Indiegogo where it\u2019s raised, at time of publication, $217k.</p><p>Crowdfunding must not be confused with purchasing a product. Instead, consumers need to know that they are doing someone a favor and help fund their dream whether it be producing a hair metal album or building a company around a 3D printer. There are countless examples where project creators fulfill their obligations and return the favor in the form of a product or service. Yet it\u2019s\u00a0projects like the Buccaneer printer from Pirate3D that cast doubts on the promise of crowdfunding.</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": ["A $1.5M Kickstarter Project Fails, Leaving Most Backers Without Their 3D Printer"], "author": ["Matt Burns"]},

Finally, it appears we\u2019re getting closer to the curtain closing on <span class=\"il\">Flash</span>.</p><p>Not too long ago, <span class=\"il\">Flash</span> powered a high percentage of the Internet\u2019s vast array of <span class=\"il\">video</span> content. Today, that number is lower. But make no mistake,\u00a0there are still many <span class=\"il\">Flash</span>-powered multimedia items on the web, including graphics, videos, games and animations, like GIFs, a preferred method of expression for millennials and adults alike.</p><p>We\u2019ve been watching HTML5 impede on <span class=\"il\">Flash</span> for a while, and it\u2019s now taking center stage, establishing itself as a predominant creative format, validated by\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-world-prepares-obituary-for-adobe-flash-1437341315\">the recent moves by Google and Mozilla</a> that are only helping to accelerate that transition.</p><p>Over the years, <span class=\"il\">Flash</span> has become famous for a few less-than flattering features that can all play a role in hindering user experience, including intrusive experiences, increasing page-load times, lowering a site\u2019s search engine optimization (SEO) and security flaws.</p><p>Despite all these grievances, the <span class=\"il\">digital-</span><span class=\"il\">video </span>advertising industry has been forced to use <span class=\"il\">Flash</span> because of VPAID (<span class=\"il\">Video</span> Player-Ad Interface Definition), a standard that allows a <span class=\"il\">video</span> ad and a <span class=\"il\">video </span>player to communicate with each other. VPAID provides a way to dynamically swap or customize <span class=\"il\">video-</span>ad creative based on ad decisions, and has long been used for <span class=\"il\">Flash-</span>based <span class=\"il\">video</span> ads on desktops.</p><p>When you consider the fact that <span class=\"il\">Flash</span> needs to be installed (as opposed to HTML5, which requires no installation), it\u2019s easy to see why in the long term, it didn\u2019t stand a chance. Some would argue that Apple\u2019s refusal to ever support it should have been a sign of things to come.</p><p>However, it\u2019s important to remember that <span class=\"il\">Flash</span> was developed in a time where the desktop was king. The long load times it commands simply aren\u2019t conducive to mobile environments \u2014 a deal-breaker for today\u2019s mobile-first world.</p><p>In spite of all this, for <span class=\"il\">digital-</span><span class=\"il\">video</span> <span class=\"il\">publishers</span>, excitement may not be the initial emotion evoked by <span class=\"il\">Flash</span>\u2018s funeral. With the goal of increasing browsing speed and reducing power consumption for users, Google\u2019s Chrome desktop browser <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chrome.blogspot.com/2015/06/better-battery-life-for-your-laptop.html\">announced</a> their formerly opt-in setting that pauses plug-in content that isn\u2019t considered essential to the webpage will become a default setting by early September.</p><p>This <span class=\"il\">means</span> that if <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> don\u2019t upgrade their format specification, some or all of their <span class=\"il\">video</span> content may no longer be available for people to view; this will certainly affect viewer loyalty and monetization efforts.</p><p>For example, <span class=\"il\">Flash</span> <span class=\"il\">video</span> ads served in a desktop Chrome browser will load in a paused state, then the user will have to click the ad for it to play. These ads will still register as impressions. However, it won\u2019t take long for programmatic buyers to scale back their bids on <span class=\"il\">video</span> ad inventory garnering a high number of impressions with no quartiles.</p><p><span class=\"il\">Publishers</span> need to urge their buyers to prepare for the upcoming F<span class=\"il\">lash</span>-pocalypse because, despite the <span class=\"il\">publishers</span>\u2018 level of preparation, if their buyers don\u2019t have the proper HTML5 creative assets, it will impact their ability to transact, having an impact on publisher revenue and the ability to successfully implement advertiser campaigns.</p><p>The most crucial thing for <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> is going to be ensuring that their advertisers and demand partners (ad networks, ad exchanges and advertisers) are providing and hosting HTML5 ad creatives moving forward.</p><p><span class=\"il\">Publishers</span> themselves will also need to migrate their tech stack. Not having a complete HTML5 advertising technology stack can potentially impact their ad revenue as buyer bids will eventually subside for non-compatible inventory.</p><p>Any change that has the potential to have a significant, long-term impact on a publisher\u2019s business is going to be a bit scary. However, in the long run, this change will be better for the <span class=\"il\">digital</span> ecosystem as a whole.</p><p>In fact, some advertising technology companies have already <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/+GoogleAds/posts/BWVyFHGUi9n\">begun </a>to automatically convert <span class=\"il\">Flash</span> ads to HTML5 to help make the transition for <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> less painful.</p><p>For <span class=\"il\">publishers</span>, one of the biggest wins of <span class=\"il\">Flash</span>\u2018s depreciation comes in the form of engineering resources saved. Historically, <span class=\"il\">video</span> <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> have always wanted to pick a standard, but the reality is, they haven\u2019t been able to because of the aforementioned VPAID issue.</p><p>They\u2019ve essentially been forced to use <span class=\"il\">Flash</span> to keep their ads business running \u2014 but also support an HTML5 code base.

Cory Cox, an analyst at CrunchBase, contributed to this post.\u00a0</i></p><p><strong>CrunchBase Female Founders Study (Part 2)</strong></p><p>In May this year, CrunchBase published its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/26/female-founders-on-an-upward-trend-according-to-crunchbase/\">first report on female founders</a>, which found that the percentage of female founders among VC-funded companies nearly doubled between 2009 and 2014. In the conclusion of that report, we promised to dig deeper into CrunchBase data to understand better what was driving this favorable trend. For our next step, we decided to look at the educational backgrounds of women founders to determine which universities and majors or graduate programs are most strongly represented among women founders.</p><p>Our data sample consists of the 3,616 female founders in CrunchBase whose companies have received funding since 2009.(1) We use funding, whether it\u2019s large or small, as a rough quality filter to ensure that the startups in our data sample have gained some traction. 72% of these companies are US-based. Where necessary, our research team filled in any self-reporting gaps on the educational details for female founders. In our data set, we found that 99% of female founders had completed their undergraduate degree.</p><p>When we were tallying the founder count for each university, we decided to lump together graduate and under-graduate degrees. If a founder had a degree from two different universities \u2014 for example, an undergraduate degree from Harvard and a graduate degree from Stanford \u2014 we credited each university once.</p><p>As you can see in the list below, Stanford and Harvard universities came out in a virtual dead heat for first place, with 236 and 235 female founders, respectively, to their credit. (Only 16 of those founders, to our surprise, claim a degree from both universities. )</p><p>MIT, the University of California (Berkeley), and Columbia University round out the top five.</p><p>These rankings are not weighted by the size of each institution. If we take that into account, the rankings\u00a0change significantly.(2)</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1191082\" style=\"border:0 solid #000000;\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/female-founder-top-25-schools.png?w=475&amp;h=793\" alt=\"Female Founder Top 25 Schools\" width=\"475\" height=\"793\"></p><p>This ranking lends itself to many interesting observations. Here are a few that jump out.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1191084\" style=\"border:0 solid #000000;\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/ivy-league.png?w=465&amp;h=339\" alt=\"Ivy league\" width=\"465\" height=\"339\"></p><p><b>Top Schools for Female Vs. Male Founders</b></p><p>We also looked at how the top schools for male founders compared. It is no big surprise that the top schools were virtually the same. But as you can see below, there were many cases where schools ranked more strongly for female founders than male. New York University (7 vs. 15) and Boston University (17 vs. 25) are the two strong examples of female surpassing male ranking, while \u00a0The University of Michigan, UC San Diego, Brown University, Georgetown University and the London School of Economics, all top 25 for female ranking, do not make the male founder Top 25.</p><p>One possible explanation is the ratio of female to male students. At Boston University and New York University, women make up 58% of enrollment. The ratio turns the other way at schools like Carnegie Mellon and MIT, which are both 63% male. MIT\u2019s rank, however, is the same for men and women founders, while Carnegie-Mellon is #10 for men but #15 for women. When we\u00a0averaged the male/female ratios across all the U.S.-based schools on the top 25 list, it worked out to a tidy 50/50.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1191573\" style=\"border:0 solid #000000;\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/female-male-rank-final.png?w=475&amp;h=835\" alt=\"Female Male rank final\" width=\"475\" height=\"835\"></p><p><b>Graduate School and Female Founders</b></p><p>We also looked at advanced degrees among female founders. \u00a0Our data set shows that 47% have a graduate degree. The most common advanced degree is an MBA, which 19% hold. This tracks closely with data from male founders, 51% of whom have a graduate degree and 21% an MBA.</p><p>When it comes to graduate programs, Harvard Business School is\u00a0clearly the front runner in absolute terms, but taking into account that HBS has more than twice the enrollment of the Stanford business school, the two premier business graduate programs are close in performance.</p><p>Business school education, however, does not necessarily trump other graduate degrees. For example, Stanford, Columbia and MIT produced more female founders from non-business advanced degree programs. At Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, on the other hand, business school graduates outnumber other graduate degrees.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1191087\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/top-postgraduate-schools.png?w=475&amp;h=513\" alt=\"Top Postgraduate schools\" width=\"475\" height=\"513\"></p><p><i>*MBA programs are highlighted</i></p><p><b>Female Founders and CS, Engineering and STEM Degrees</b></p><p>If graduate level education is roughly comparable for men and women founders, we wondered if there were significant differences in terms of undergraduate majors.</p><p>The top degrees for female founders in undergraduate studies are Social Science (30%), Business (18%), and Arts and Humanities (17%), Computer Science (10%) and Engineering (8%). \u00a0When we\u00a0sliced the data by STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) vs other majors, we found 31% of female founders have undergraduate degrees in the STEM core.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1191089\" style=\"border:0 solid #000000;\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/final-ff-subject.png?w=470&amp;h=381\" alt=\"Final - FF Subject\" width=\"470\" height=\"381\"></p><p>When we contrasted these numbers with male founders, there was a stark difference. Computer science (33%) and engineering (20%) are the top the undergraduate degrees, which means that male founders are three times more likely to have a computer science degree and slightly more than twice as likely to have an engineering degree. From a STEM perspective, fully 63% of male founders have STEM degree, more than twice the percentage for women.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1191090\" style=\"border:0 solid #000000;\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/final-mf-subject.png?w=470&amp;h=431\" alt=\"Final - MF Subject\" width=\"470\" height=\"431\"></p><p>The striking difference in educational backgrounds between male and female entrepreneurs will undoubtedly provoke discussion and a variety of interpretations. It seems reasonable to suggest that CS, engineering and STEM degrees are one strong pre-cursor to tech entrepreneurship, based on what the data shows for male founders. On the other hand, female founders are four times more likely than males to have an arts and humanities degree (17% vs. 4%) \u00a0and more than twice as likely to have a social science degree (30% v \u00a013%). That may suggest that female founders find\u00a0entrepreneurial inspiration in ways male founders are less likely to.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious that tech startups require technologists, but startups\u00a0also require highly creative, persistent and insightful leadership, which does not require a technology background. As the number of female founders increases over time, it will be interesting to watch how the comparative educational backgrounds of male and female founders change. The story may be one of convergence: already today 18% of male and female founders study business as undergraduates. \u00a0Almost certainly the delta that exists in STEM education will shrink, but at the same time, it\u2019s probably wrong to conclude that over time female founders will necessarily\u00a0conform to\u00a0their male peers\u2019 educational profiles on the way to becoming entrepreneurs. \u00a0Whatever patterns emerge, that story will be remarkable to watch.</p><p>CrunchBase will continue to improve and mine the data around female founders and education.

{"date": ["2015-05-28"], "text": "<p>As expected, Google today announced the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://developer.android.com/preview/index.html\">developer preview release</a> of the next version of Android at its I/O developer conference in San Francisco. With Android M (which will get its full name once it\u2019s released to users), Google focuses mostly on fit and finish, but the company also added a number of new features to its mobile operating system.</p><p>It\u2019s no surprise that\u00a0Android M won\u2019t feature any major new design elements. The last release, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/12/android-5-0-lollipop-review-2/\">Android Lollipop</a>, introduced Google\u2019s Material Design language, after all, and there are still plenty of developers who haven\u2019t even migrated their apps over.</p><p>As Google\u2019s Director of Product Management Brian Rakowski told me earlier this week, the company has learned a lot since the team\u00a0introduced Lollipop at last year\u2019s I/O and quite a bit of that learning has found its way into Android M.</p><p>The preview release includes updated SDKs, system images for testing on the Android emulator and the Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and the Nexus player. Google says it has fixed \u201cthousands of bugs\u201d in this release and that it will provide updated preview system images regularly during the preview program. The consumer launch is scheduled for fall.</p><p>In addition to Android M for phones, Google also today announced an update to Android Wear, as well as Android for the Internet of Things.</p><p>Here are some of the highlights of the new release:</p><p>The highlights of the release include a new, more contextual variant of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/landing/now/\">Google Now</a> called Google Now On Tap that can give you more information about the things\u00a0you are currently looking at in any given app on your phone or tablet.\u00a0According to Google, this new service provides you with\u00a0a contextual assistant that can help you get stuff done faster.</p><p>Here is how this works: say you\u00a0are\u00a0having a text chat\u00a0with a friend in Hangouts about <em>Mad Max</em> and when you bring up Now On Tap by tapping and holding the home button on your phone (hence the \u2018on tap\u2019), Google will know what you\u2019ve been talking about in\u00a0the app and give you more info about it (in this case, that\u2019s probably movie times, a list of actors in the movie, relevant apps, etc.).</p><p>While developers won\u2019t have to do anything to enable this feature for their apps (it\u2019s built-in at the OS level), they can help Google understand the context in their apps better by adding a bit of metadata to their apps.</p><p>We have a full post about this new feature <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wp.me/p1FaB8-4Sjh\">here</a>.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1164123\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/google-io-20150155.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" alt=\"google-io-20150155\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-1162312\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/android-pay-mark.png?w=349&amp;h=349\" alt=\"Android Pay mark\" width=\"349\" height=\"349\">With <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/09/announces-mobile-payments-solution-called-apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> looming large, the failure of Google Wallet as a mobile payments system was pretty apparent in the last few months. Now, with Android Pay, Google is taking a new stab at this market and this time, it\u2019s cooperating with a number of vendors, including AT&amp;T, Verizon (soon to be the parent company of TechCrunch) and T-Mobile, who will pre-load Android Pay on their phones. Google says Pay should work with all phones that have an NFC chip and run Android KitKat forward.</p><p>The focus with Pay, Google says, is on simplicity, security and choice. The company also stresses that this is an open platform. Banking partners include American Express, Discover, Visa and MasterCard. Google has already worked with a number of app developers to integrate Pay into their apps, too.</p><p>Like Apple Pay, Android Pay will work for both in-app purchases and purchases in brick-and-mortar stores. Developers who want to support it can simply call the Pay\u00a0API.\u00a0Google says it wants to give developers\u00a0as much choice as possible, down to who they want to use as they payment provider.</p><p>Users will be able to use Android\u2019s\u00a0usual unlock mechanisms to access Pay, as well as the new fingerprint scanner support in Android M. In apps, developers will be able to support the fingerprint scanner to quickly authenticate users for payments, too.</p><p>Google Wallet will continue to exist in parallel with Pay for the time being, but it\u2019s focus will be on peer-to-peer payments now.</p><p>As rumored, Android M will also feature support for fingerprint scanners. While some OEMs already built this into their devices, there has never been system-level support for this in Android. After looking at what OEMs were doing in this area \u2014 and surely Apple\u2019s efforts around Touch ID \u2014 Google\u00a0decided it was time to create a system-wide standard for this feature. As you would expect, users will be able to unlock the phone with their fingerprints and authorize payments.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1164020\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/google-io-20150100.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" alt=\"google-io-20150100\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-1162313\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/app-permissions-settings.png?w=348&amp;h=618\" alt=\"App Permissions settings\" width=\"348\" height=\"618\">Until now, users had to give apps permission to access their contacts, files, camera, photos or whatever else the app needed when they installed the app. Often, though, users may not even fully understand why an app would want access to their contacts, for example, and simply choose to abort the install process there. Too many apps, after all, tend to overreach when it comes to permissions.</p><p>Android M feature a completely revamped permissions process. Instead of asking users for all of their permissions in a single dialog when they install the app,\u00a0Google will now move the process to when users run an app for the first time. And instead of asking for all permissions at once, developer can choose to ask them only when the app needs them. So a camera app may ask for camera, microphone and camera roll access right when you first launch it, but then it will ask for access to your contacts only once you want to share a photo or video. That way, developers can ask for permissions in the right context and users will understand why the app is asking for access to this info.</p><p>Developers who don\u2019t update their apps will see that their apps will still use the old permissions model, but they will have to modify their apps to enable these more granular permissions. No matter whether developers update their apps or not, users will be able to change every aspect of their permissions in the Android settings menu.</p><p><img class=\"  wp-image-1162314 alignleft\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/usb-type-c-macro-image.png?w=350&amp;h=197\" alt=\"USB Type C macro image\" width=\"350\" height=\"197\">Google tells me the Android team also worked hard on improving performance and memory usage across the board. The one feature the team is most proud of, though, is the new \u2018doze\u2019 mode that will help improve the battery life of devices that stay stationary for a while.</p><p>This new mode is different from Android current \u2018battery saver\u2019 mode, which is meant for when you are actually using the device. Rakowski tells me that the new mode is meant for when you put your tablet or phone away for a while.\u00a0Google already powers most of the device\u2019s hardware down at that point, but because many apps love to pull in new data every few minutes, the phone or tablet\u00a0tends to wake up regularly to download your email, for example. Now, Android will manage this and slow down the syncing rate automatically. When you\u2019re not using the device, you don\u2019t really care how long it takes to download your emails, after all, and when you pick it back up, all your information will still be in sync</p><p>Rakowski tells me that this can increase the battery life of a Nexus 9 tablet by up to 50%, for example.\u00a0Google also stressed the real-time alarms will still work as expected and high-priority messages will still arrive just like before.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1164028\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/google-io-20150105.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" alt=\"google-io-20150105\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><p>Android M also makes it easier for developers to link between Android apps. Android, of course, has always allowed apps to register to natively handle certain URLs. The Android platform always had support for intents, but if you had a number of apps that used the same URL scheme, though, Android\u00a0would have to pop up a disambiguation prompt (and in my experience, it often forget your choice). Now, developers can set what Google calls the \u201cautoVerify\u201d attribute in their app manifest that will ensure that users can be linked right into their native app with that prompt.</p><p>On the web front, Google also launched Chrome Custom Tabs. This means that when you tab on a web link in a native app, the web link will open in a custom tab that feels native to the app, even with custom buttons back into the app. The content is pre-fetched, so the web content will launch extremely fast.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1163997\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/google-io-20150087.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" alt=\"google-io-20150087\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><p>Google tells me the team has also worked on\u00a0bringing USB-C support to Android. Google says it is working with device manufacturers to bring devices with USB-C to users soon.</p><p>\u201cWith this release, we focused on product excellence, and polish to file down the rough edges that have been bothering us over the years \u2014 as well as things that we didn\u2019t get done in time last year,\u201d\u00a0Rakowski said<b>.</b></p><p>Other updates to Android M include easier word selection, a new sharing feature that highlights the people and apps you share with most often, simplified volume controls that allow you to control music, a unified settings menu, alarms and other volume setting more easily.</p><p>Developers who want to make use of the features in this new release will likely want to install the latest update of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\">Android Studio</a> (1.3) from the Canary release channel. This new version supports Android M, but it also introduces features like code editing and debugging for C and C++ code (something game developers, who tend to use these languages for their apps, have long asked for).</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/io2015/\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/io2015-banner.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>", "title": ["Google Launches Android M Preview With Fingerprint Scanner Support, Android Pay, Improved Permissions And Battery Life"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},

Rather than pairing the use cases of sharing your location with friends and searching for things to do, the company split those experiences into two apps. That said, Swarm is a very different app from the original <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/foursquare\">Foursquare</a> and its gamified check-ins.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/product/swarm-2\">Swarm</a> uses a feature called Neighborhood Sharing to offer up passive, relatively vague information about the proximity of your friends. It will share information about who is within 500 ft, a mile, and so on, as well as information around specific check-ins from friends.</p><p>The marriage of these forms of information sharing \u2014 both passive and active \u2014 set up the foundation for a real social planning play, but Swarm is still just an infant in the app world.</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of growing to do.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/12/fly-or-die-the-new-foursquare/\">many loyal foursquare users miss the gamification</a> of the check-in, and Swarm does little to replace that besides giving away various \u201cstickers\u201d for different types of check-ins.</p><p>However, the app does try to integrate social in a new way from the foursquare of the past, with options to make plans with friends and ping people directly from within the app to hang out.</p><p>Still, the pivot is likely a good choice for the company, who had a loyal but small following before and did little to leverage massive troves of data.

{"date": [], "text": "<p>Did you know you\u2019re supposed to replace your toothbrush every three months? Apparently, this is actually <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ada.org/en/about-the-ada/ada-positions-policies-and-statements/statement-on-toothbrush-care-cleaning-storage-and-\">the recommended time frame preferred by the ADA</a>, but most consumers just wait until their bristles wear out, or it randomly occurs to them as they\u2019re walking through the dental care aisle at their local store.</p><p>A startup called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.getquip.com\">Quip</a>, showcasing its service here today at TechCrunch Disrupt NY\u2019s Startup Alley, believes it has a better way: a new brushes as a subscription service, shipped to you automatically every three months.</p><p>The company now has some investor buy-in as well, as it\u2019s raised additional seed funding\u00a0after being live for just a few months. Since its launch in February, it has grown\u00a0its subscription business to \u201cseveral thousand\u201d customers.</p><p>At first, it sounds sort of crazy. After all, how lazy are people that they need toothbrushes, of all things, on a subscription basis? But if you think back to when you actually last replaced your toothbrush, and then think about all the other, <em>um\u2026matter,</em>\u00a0that floats around in your\u00a0bathroom where your toothbrush\u00a0is kept, you might convince\u00a0yourself\u00a0that you need a little\u00a0reminder to swap out your\u00a0old brush for a new one.</p><p>The startup was founded by Simon Enever, an industrial designer previously at fuseproject, and product designer Bill May. Enever explains that having worked with dental care clients in the past, he found that many\u00a0of the innovations surrounding toothbrush bristles and toothpaste are simply gimmicks. What dentists really need people to do is to brush often, floss and, of course, swap out their brushes on a regular basis.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1153626\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/quip2.jpg?w=680&amp;h=255\" alt=\"quip2\" width=\"680\" height=\"255\"></p><p>At Quip, you initially purchase either a plastic brush base for $25 or a metal base for $40, each of which comes with your first three months of toothpaste and your first toothbrush head. Both brushes also vibrate, allowing you to clean your teeth more effectively. (Most people brush too hard, as it turns out. The vibration encourages them to brush with the right amount of pressure.)</p><p>The brushes themselves are custom-designed and assembled in the U.S. The metals are also sourced in the U.S., while the plastics are from China.</p><p>When it comes time to replace your toothbrush, you pull out the head and toss it. Every three months you get a pack with a\u00a0new head, a 4.7-ounce tube of toothpaste and a travel toothpaste. After buying the base unit, the subscription cost is only $5 every three months \u2013 which frankly is more than reasonable when compared to\u00a0the cost of buying new in the store.</p><p>Meanwhile, the company itself is doing fairly well even at this low price point \u2013 its margins are above 50 percent.</p><p>Quip has experimented\u00a0with selling the brushes directly, without requiring customers to agree to\u00a0recurring billing. However, they found that the majority of those (98 percent) who visited Quip converted to subscribers.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1153654\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/quip-toothbrushes.png?w=510&amp;h=680\" alt=\"quip-toothbrushes\" width=\"510\" height=\"680\"></p><p>Quip raised $300,000 in 2014 from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/kal-vepuri\">Kal Vepuri</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quip-2\">other</a> New York area angels. Now the startup is in the process of raising an additional, larger\u00a0seed round of $500,000+ with prior angels and other investors. (Quip has soft commitments of $500K+, and $125K has closed).</p><p>One challenge for Quip is in educating the market that changing their toothbrush more often is something that they should be\u00a0doing, and that a set-it-and-forget option like this even exists. But getting real-world dentists on board as partners could help Quip get in front of customers. This is something the team is focusing on, says Enever.</p><p>New York-based Quip is currently endorsed by an NYU dentist, and is planning to announce some dentist partnerships in the near future. They\u2019re also in discussions with a dental firm that\u00a0may become investors.</p><p>Also today, Quip is launching its referral program, which is aimed at\u00a0helping the\u00a0company generate more word-of-mouth (ha!) referrals.

In\u00a0October 2013, it <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/10/photo-sharing-service-familiar-gets-acquired-by-tasers-evidence-com-for-an-entperprise-turn-after-offers-from-twitter-and-more/\">acquired</a> a photo and video sharing startup called Familiar, after going up against the likes of Twitter and others who were also interested in the company. Familiar\u2019s team and technology got incorporated into Evidence.com, the name of the division that works on wearables and cloud services.</p><p>In May of this year, that\u00a0division then kicked of a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/8/5691730/taser-equips-london-cops-with-500-on-body-cameras\">large, groundbreaking pilot in London</a>, where police have been equipped with on-body cameras to record activities, both as a way of helping to gather evidence in chaotic situations, and also in an effort for more transparency with a public that has grown increasingly mistrustful of law enforcement. Taser says that using such devices has actually helped keep police in check and led to less abusive behaviour by everyone.</p><p>It\u2019s also taken on new leadership recently, with Marcus Womack, one of Familiar\u2019s co-founders, now leading Evidence.com after former president\u00a0Jason Droege <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jdroege/statuses/448124913094639616\">left\u00a0in March</a> to join his buddy\u00a0from college, Travis Kalanick, at Uber.</p><p>In that context, Taylor\u2019s appointment is an interesting one, in that he\u2019s adding expertise and connections in a number of areas to Taser\u2019s board. In addition to his experience and credibility in building social media technology \u2014 before Facebook, he co-founded FriendFeed, which Facebook acquired \u2014 Taylor\u00a0had been at Google, where he was one of creators of Google Maps. And these days, he\u2019s cutting his teeth in enterprise services with Quip, the word processing app that hopes to break into\u00a0Microsoft Word\u2019s and Google Docs\u2019 territory by way of its slick, mobile-first approach.</p><p>With the last of these, adding\u00a0a board role at Taser to his experience, therefore, could have benefits on both sides, since it will give Taylor more enterprise credibility that could help Quip gain further traction.</p><p>But in\u00a0Taylor\u2019s words, it sounds like the move was more about a principle rather than a straight business decision.</p><p>\u201cTaser\u00a0is applying technology to important social issues that I care deeply about,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis is an important opportunity to use technology to protect civil liberties. I believe Taser\u00a0is poised to revolutionize the public safety space with enhanced transparency from body-worn camera technology while leveraging the cloud to manage the massive data being generated by wearable cameras and sensors. I\u2019m thrilled to be joining the Taser Board.\u201d</p><p>Taylor is not the only board member with extensive tech credibility: he\u2019ll be joining Hadi Partovi, who is an advisor and investor in\u00a0Dropbox, a co-founder of Code.org, and has a very impressive resume as an angel investor (the portfolio includes\u00a0Facebook, Zappos, and more),\u00a0entrepreneur (he also founded Tellme, acquired by Microsoft, and iLike, acquired by MySpace when MySpace was still huge), and executive (he ran MSN.com for Microsoft among other roles at large companies).</p><p>Partovi tells me that Taylor\u2019s addition to the board will help Taser continue not only to build out tech for law enforcement organisations \u2014 speeding up the pace of innovation in an area that has been traditionally slow \u2014\u00a0but also to help Taser expand to \u201cadjacent\u201d verticals where its solutions might also be applicable. \u201cWearables and the cloud technology behind them are impacting every industry,\u201d he says.</p>", "title": ["Taser Adds Former Facebook CTO Bret Taylor To Its Board"], "author": ["Ingrid Lunden"]},

The apps have shot up\u00a0to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store after last week\u2019s pricing changes. Before, Microsoft had required iPad users to subscribe\u00a0to\u00a0Office 365 in order to create new files, and had offered a limited feature set on iPhone. But that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/microsoft-doubles-down-on-office-for-tablets/\">all changed on Thursday</a>.</p><p>Microsoft finally began to allow <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/microsoft-doubles-down-on-office-for-tablets/\">more of the public to use its Office apps for free</a>, releasing new unified applications as a part of its Office for iOS suite. The updated apps included <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/microsoft-doubles-down-on-office-for-tablets/\">integration with Dropbox</a>, and fewer restrictions on use as the company embraced the \u201cfreemium\u201d strategy to achieve increased iOS market share.</p><p>The company also\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2014/11/06/office-everywhere/\">last week</a>\u00a0said\u00a0that 1 billion people use Office, and its Office for iPad product had been downloaded more than 40 million times. Those are decent numbers, of course.</p><p>But the company had long delayed the release of Office for iOS as the mobile ecosystem grew, hoping to use Office\u2019s market position as a way to draw users and businesses alike to the Microsoft Windows platform. That gave competitors like Apple and Google room to establish footholds of their own on mobile devices with software that consumers can now access for free. While Google\u2019s online office software had always been free for consumers, Apple last fall <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/10/23Apple-Introduces-Next-Generation-iWork-and-iLife-Apps-for-OS-X-and-iOS.html\">announced</a> its productivity apps would also become free and ship with every new Mac and iOS device.</p><p>Pundits\u00a0may say that Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0jump to this free model is a move that\u2019s too little, too late.\u00a0But consumers, in droves, are giving Microsoft\u2019s Office iOS apps\u00a0a shot now that they\u2019ve been opened up more broadly.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1079615\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/powerpoint-for-ipad-hero.png?w=680&amp;h=510\" alt=\"PowerPoint for iPad hero\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\"></p><p>And some of the early iTunes ratings are good, too. One reviewer gave Microsoft Word 5 stars before even using the app because they were so frustrated with Apple\u2019s Pages. Others touted the new price (\u201cfree\u201d) as being the biggest advantage, or praised the Dropbox integrations. But many also complained about lacking features or bugs, leaving Word\u2019s overall rating at just 3.5 stars. That indicates Microsoft can still make a number of\u00a0improvements, at least in consumer\u2019s eyes.</p><p>On iPhone, Microsoft Word is #1, while Excel and PowerPoint are #8 and #10, respectively.

Microsoft wants the operating system on one billion devices in the next few years, and that puts Microsoft 11 percent of the way toward its goal.</p><p>Also up top was some welcome news for Windows 10 users: Facebook is building several \u2018universal\u2019 apps for the platform. The move should improve the social functionality of all Windows 10 hardware.</p><p>The surprise hit of the day was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/microsoft-launches-the-surface-book-a-convertible-laptop-done-right/#.yhcf3z:L3mj\">the Surface Book</a>, which Microsoft considers a laptop. Although the Surface line was designed to have some in-lap functionality, the Surface Book should offer more than the company\u2019s past hybrid tablets. The Surface Book may not look like its predecessors, but there\u2019s a twist. The damn thing comes apart into two pieces so you can use it as a stand-alone tablet.</p><p>The convertible laptop sports a 13.5-inch display, a trackpad made of glass, a backlit keyboard and a machined magnesium body. The Surface Book has the latest generation of the Intel Core processor and an Nvidia GPU with GDDR5 memory. Microsoft claims its the fastest laptop of its size ever made, and has 12-hour battery life, 267 ppi pixel density display and a keyboard that is said to be very quiet.</p><p>The Surface Book starts at $1,499 and is available to pre-order on October 7.</p><p>By far the most anticipated device before the event, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/microsoft-announces-the-surface-pro-4/\">the Surface Pro 4 is real</a>, up for pre-order\u00a0tomorrow, and is essentially a strong iterative improvement on its predecessor. That\u2019s not shade \u2014 the Surface Pro 3 sold well for a reason. Microsoft noted at the top of its show that Surface now generates around $3.5 billion in yearly revenue, up from nothing just a few years ago.</p><p>The Pro 4 stands out for keeping a similar design to the Pro 3 but fitting a larger screen into the space. That means less bezel, of course.</p><p>The Surface Pro 4 will have to face off against similar products from both Apple and Google.</p><p>Microsoft says the Pro 4 is its thinnest Surface Pro to date. The 12.3 inch screen has 267 PPI and supports over 5 million pixels. Microsoft revamped its stylus and Type cover. The stylus will now contain a year\u2019s worth of battery life and snap to the edge of the device. The Type cover will have a chiclet-style keyboard.</p><p>The device will retail for $899 and be available on Oct. 26.</p><p>The media called this one some time ago, but it was still edifying to see Microsoft <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/microsoft-unveils-the-lumia-950-and-lumia-950-xl-two-new-powerful-windows-phones/\">trot out new phone hardware</a>. Keep in mind that it was only so long ago that the Redmond-based software giant had to endure an embarrassing multi-billion dollar writedown related to its smartphone business.</p><p>The phone and phablet are exclusive to AT&amp;T in the U.S. Both come with octacore and hexacore processors as well as liquid cooling technology. The phone features a 5.2-inch display, while the XL phablet has a 5.7-inch display. Their OLED displays have a pixel density of 564 ppi and 518 ppi respectively. Both have 20-megapixel cameras with natural flash and can shoot 4K video. They come with 32GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot and a new USB Type-C connector.</p><p>Both will ship in November. The 950 retails at $549, and the XL sells for $649.</p><p>Microsoft\u2019s augmented reality project HoloLens picked a decent whack of stage time during the event. Microsoft faced the challenge of demoing it to an audience that didn\u2019t have their own devices to track along, but the company made some news all the same.</p><p>Microsoft showcased new live games for HoloLens on Tuesday, including a shooting game that projects robots on your living room walls. The real potential for the HoloLens lies in the projects third party developers create.</p><p>However you still can\u2019t buy one.

It\u2019s able to sense changes in elevation, and has an improved set of health tracking tools.</p><p>It\u2019s available for pre-order today for $249 and will retail on October 30.</p><p>Microsoft <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/microsoft-promises-windows-10-for-xbox-one-this-holiday/\">will bring its Xbox One gaming console under the aegis of Windows 10 this year</a>, so you don\u2019t have much longer to wait for that code to drop.</p><p>This means you\u2019ll be able to play your XBox 360 games on the XBox One.

{"date": ["2014-05-22"], "text": "<p>Every day companies collect data about their customers and industries, simply as an artifact of the act conducting business. As I listened to a panel on Big Data yesterday at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mitcio.com/\">MIT Sloan CIO Symposium</a> in Cambridge, Mass., I had an epiphany: every company is a Big Data company, it\u2019s just that some get it and some don\u2019t.</p><p>There is a notion around cloud computing that companies born in the cloud have an advantage over those that are transitioning to the cloud\u00a0because they have an acute understanding of how it works that a company moving\u00a0to the cloud can\u2019t possibly match. There is a similar idea of companies that are raised on using data to drive their company and those searching for ways to do that.</p><p>Panel member Barry Morris, founder and CEO at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nuodb.com/\">NuoDB</a>, repeatedly brought up electric car maker Tesla as an example of a company that uses data as part of the act of doing business to make business decisions. There isn\u2019t this deliberate process of trying to figure out how to use data. They just do it.</p><p>As Morris explained, Tesla doesn\u2019t have a committee studying how to take advantage of data. Instead, they are constantly looking at the data being delivered to them from the cars themselves. This data tells them\u00a0when brake pads are going to wear out, how far people are getting on a single charge to the battery and the most logical place to build the next charging station. They are monitoring every bit of data they can collect, and while they aren\u2019t selling data, they are using it as an integral part of how they do business.</p><p>This idea of data as a business artifact was driven home further when I spoke to\u00a0Burton M. Goldfield, who is CEO at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.trinet.com/\">TriNet</a>, a company that handles human resources-related regulatory and and legal issues for small business.</p><p>As Goldfield pointed out, they count 9,000 business with over 240,000 employees under their watch. They handle payroll and benefits and other services for these businesses, and that gives them tremendous insight into the health and well-being of small business, simply by the act of conducting business.</p><p>They put out a report every month on the state of the small business jobs market. Right now it\u2019s free, a handy bit of content marketing to show off the company expertise, but Goldfield says because they have their finger on the pulse of small business, they can generate this kind of report, whether they choose to monetize it or not.</p><p>As an example of the kind of deep understanding they can get from this data, Goldfield told me, they saw venture capitalist bonus checks dry up in 2008. He says they didn\u2019t realize what it meant as it happened, but in hindsight they know it was a warning sign of a deeper economic crisis.</p><p>Just this week <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1932680&amp;highlight=\">Amazon released a report on the 20 most well-read cities in America</a>. According to a press release, they generated this list, \u201cby compiling sales data of all book, magazine and newspaper sales in both print and Kindle format from\u00a0April 2013\u00a0to April 2014, on a per capita basis in cities with more than 100,000 residents.\u201d Like TriNet, Amazon is simply creating a report that provides fodder for discussion and takes advantage of the information they collect as part of the act of selling books and periodicals.</p><p>Brian Lillie who is CIO at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.equinix.com/\">Equinix</a>, a company that provides data center services, says they use data as part of their business because it makes sense to measure what\u2019s happening at their data centers and find ways to operate them most efficiently. \u00a0\u201cWe\u00a0use data\u00a0to predictively watch for issues before\u00a0they happen,\u201d Lillie told me.</p><p>When is a part about to fail? How can they reduce cooling costs? All of this information helps them at the business level because the sooner they understand this information and run more efficiently, the more money they are likely to make.

After all, the company bet a lot on the popularity of a brand-new Microsoft, complete with Metro, touch, and true entry into the hardware space.</p><p>The first tablet is said to be an 8.6-inch Surface RT 2, running on a Qualcomm chipset instead of the NVIDIA Tegra 3 chip. The Microsoft Pro will allegedly upgrade to an 11.6-inch display with an unreleased AMD \u201cTemash\u201d APU, and a new Surface Book product will sport a hefty 14.6-inch display with a next-gen 22nm \u201cHaswell\u201d chip from Intel under the hood.</p><p>It\u2019s interesting that none of the new models have the same 10.6-inch screen size as current-generation Surface RT and Pro slates do. However, in our <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/microsoft-surface-rt-review/\">reviews</a>, we felt the form factor was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/19/i-got-one-but-i-dont-get-it/\">a bit awkward</a>\u00a0and larger than the tablet that currently dominates the large tablet space, the 9.7-inch iPad.</p><p>And then there\u2019s Amazon and Google\u2019s 7- to 8-inch offerings, and Barnes &amp; Noble, and we can\u2019t forget the iPad Mini now, either. Microsoft is late to a very feisty and competitive game, and a big push is necessary. And so far Surface sales have been <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/12/microsoft-surface-sales-starting-modestly-says-ballmer-wont-give-exact-sales-figures/\">slow going</a>.</p><p>The breadth of the lineup also sounds plausible alongside rumors of a Surface phone, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20121126PD221.html\">DigiTimes</a> recently reported that Microsoft has sent orders to Foxconn for a self-branded and Microsoft-designed Surface phone.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019ll still be a while.

Younger users remain more likely to get their news via Facebook than Twitter, according to the study.</p><p>Both tech platforms prefer\u00a0to couch themselves as\u00a0content distribution\u00a0platforms, rather than content publishers \u2014 typically denying they\u00a0have a role in\u00a0editorially shaping what their users\u00a0see, despite making what some might term \u2018editorial judgements\u2019 to, for instance, remove certain types of content from their platforms.

These different ways of connecting with news have implications for how Americans\u00a0learn about the world and their communities, and for how they take part in the democratic process,\u201d notes\u00a0Amy Mitchell, Pew Research Center\u2019s director of\u00a0journalism research, in a statement.</p><p>Facebook also recently launched a program to natively host publishers\u2019 content \u2014 called <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/12/facebook-instant-articles/\">Facebook Instant Articles</a> \u2014 with the aim of\u00a0reducing article load times in the hopes of\u00a0keeping users sticking around on its platform for longer.

They\u2019re no place for first time investors and that\u2019s one of the things we focus on. Making it accessible. Having it be mobile friendly.\u201d</p><p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1061599\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/robinhood-app.png?w=631&amp;h=680\" alt=\"Robinhood App\" width=\"631\" height=\"680\"></p><p class=\"p1\">Tenev and Bhatt are serial financial technology entrepreneurs, having launched companies in algorithmic trading and investment bank software. While working on Wall Street in 2011, they saw the 99% movement first-hand, and devised an app to allow anyone to get involved with stocks. \u201cIt all comes back to the name\u201d Bhatt says with real emotion in his voice. \u201cWe ask ourselves, \u2018if we were to use a financial service that called itself Robinhood, what would we expect it to do?'\u201d</p><p class=\"p1\">They brought <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/18/robinhood-app/\">Robinhood out of stealth in April 2013</a>\u00a0to see if they could take the commission charges out of stock trading by replacing costly meatspace offices and marketing spend with lean software and a mobile app.</p><p class=\"p1\">This unlocks a much younger, less wealthy demographic that has historically been deterred from stock trading because a $10 fee represents a significant percentage of their total investment. It\u2019s no big deal if you have plenty of money to throw around, but If you only want to buy a few hundred dollars worth of stock, paying $10 up front makes earning returns much harder. Ditching fees has led to 80 percent of beta users being under the age of 30.</p><p class=\"p1\">Robinhood is\u00a0still in friends and family private beta, but <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/27/trade-stocks-free-robinhood/\">its app lets people buy, sell, research and monitor stocks for free</a>. Engagement looks promising. Fifty percent of customers who\u2019ve made a trade come back every day, and 90% come back every week.</p><p class=\"p1\">In December 2013, Robinhood raised <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/18/zero-commission-stock-trading-robinhood/\">$3 million from Index and Andreessen Horowitz</a>. Today\u2019s Series A round joined by financial tech fund Ribbit Capital, StockTwits\u2019 Howard Lindzon, Path founder Dave Morin\u2019s Slow Ventures, Box\u2019s Aaron Levie, Snoop Dogg, Jared Leto, and Nas of Queensbridge Venture Partners brings Robinhood to $16 million in funding. Bhatt tells me \u201cit\u2019s important that Robinhood as a company is very well capitalized and that we have the backing of world-class venture capital firms that will stand behind the product\u201d so that users know the company won\u2019t suddenly fold. \u201cFinancial institutions have communicated their trustworthiness by having their name etched\u00a0in some marble building on Wall Street,\u201d says Bhatt. \u201cBut that just doesn\u2019t resonate with people any more.\u201d</p><p class=\"p1\">Index Ventures partner Jan Hammer will join Robinhood\u2019s board. Bhatt explains that Robinhood chose Index out of the competitive round because they regularly invest financial startups like WealthFront and SigFig. \u201cFor them, investing in a company that\u2019s regulated like us, a financial company, isn\u2019t an unknown. They\u2019re committed to seeing us through all that stuff. Hammer tells me Index chased Robinhood because \u201cthe product has been developed by founders for their own generation \u2013 it\u2019s a smart, slick and easy-to-use mobile app that revolutionizes the experience of accessing public markets.\u201d He also cited the quality of the founders and the 20-person company\u2019s opportunity to pull a new cohort into investing.</p><p class=\"p1\">You can learn more about Robinhood from this little video it shot with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandwichvideo.com/\">Sandwich</a>, of Coin demo fame.</p><p class=\"p1\">What\u2019s the plan for the $13 million? Bhatt tells me \u201cwe\u2019re a technology company, so we\u2019re growing the team with top-tier engineers and designers from MIT and Stanford with former experience at Facebook, Google and Palantir.\u201d Their goal will be to make Robinhood 100 percent secure and reliable so it can expand its public beta and get ready for a full launch. Bhatt admits \u201cthe margin for error is nonexistent.\u201d If people\u2019s trades don\u2019t go through or there\u2019s a security breach, doubt could ripple through its user base and kill the startup before it starts. Still, it\u2019s had some users on its wait list for 9 months now (and its been 18 months since it came out of stealth), so it should do its best to keep people happy and informed while they stew.</p><p class=\"p1\">If it can run a tight ship, though, Robinhood could earn Wall Street-sized bags of cash despite being free for users. The model is to charge other startups to build apps on top of its API for lean trading. It could also charge to let users trade on margin \u2014 with borrowed money while their own is locked up in the standard three-day waiting period after you sell stock. It could also get paid by stock exchanges that want more trading volume, which Robinhood hopes to be able to deliver. And if the company can really get people to trust it with their money, Robinhood could earn interest on assets it holds.</p><p class=\"p1\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.robinhood.com/\">Robinhood</a>\u2018s success will come down to making something as big and scary as trading stocks feel breezy from a phone. Bhatt concludes \u201cthe conventional fear is that \u2018I thought I needed millions of dollars to invest in the stock market.\u2019 You don\u2019t even need thousands of dollars.\u201d</p>", "title": ["Robinhood Raises $13M To Democratize Stock Market With Zero-Commission Trading App"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},

Fast forward to today, and things are evolving \u2014 or taking a step back, depending on how you look at it: The startup is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://quip.com/blog/desktop\">releasing</a>\u00a0its first official desktop apps for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://quip.com/download\">Mac and Windows</a>.</p><p>It\u2019s a somewhat\u00a0ironic turn, given that when he was first launching Quip, Taylor mocked legacy word processing programs, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/30/quip-mobile-word-processor/\">noting</a> that\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s comical how similar [MacWrite]\u00a0looks like\u00a0what we use today\u201d and how most desktop programs don\u2019t\u00a0address how consumers are turning away from legacy computing devices.</p><p>So why the change of heart? Quip is following its users.</p><p>Quip today has over 30,000 businesses and \u201cmillions of individuals\u201d using its apps, including companies like Facebook, CNN, Instacart and Al Jazeera \u2014 a figure that has grown dramatically since the company launched spreadsheets last October (when it only had 10,000 business customers).</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s meant we\u2019ve had an explosion of desktop website usage,\u201d he says. As a point of comparison, in January 2014, the split between mobile and desktop was 80/20. Today, it\u2019s 50/50, Taylor says. While those desktop users\u00a0could access documents through the web,\u00a0was time to give them a dedicated native app.</p><p>While the app gives users more parity between desktop usage and Quip mobile apps \u2014 same features to access and modify documents, and also provide a space for coworkers to comment on them and other things \u2014 it also has a few features unique to the platforms on which it sits. The Mac version, for example, integrates with Spotlight search, and also gives users native notifications when documents that their tagged or working on get modified.</p><p>With the update, Quip\u2019s also opening up a bit more about how it\u2019s architected its whole service, which in itself is a pretty fascinating idea and points to why the company thinks that \u2014 even as a later entrant into desktop word processing against incumbents like Microsoft Word, or cloud-based services like Google\u2019s Apps \u2014 it has a distinct advantage.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1180113\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/quip-desktop-document.png?w=680&amp;h=425\" alt=\"Quip-Desktop-Document\" width=\"680\" height=\"425\"></p><p>In essence, as Taylor describes it, Quip has \u201cabandoned the concept of a file.\u201d Instead, it has\u00a0broken down documents into small, more granular modules.</p><p>This gives Quip documents some very interesting usability characteristics.</p><p>First,\u00a0when two or more people are working on a document, you can edit different sections simultaneously and they are much easier to integrate with each other.</p><p>What it also means is that if you are offline and are editing a document, and someone else is editing it elsewhere, you are less likely to have conflicts between versions, since the only parts being impacted are those more granular sections that you have modified. Taylor tells me that in cases where there\u00a0<em>are</em> conflicts, the two versions of the fragment in question are saved in the collaboration notes that are always present alongside the document so that you can decide which revision wins.</p><p>Second, the more granular segments for the files also means that when a document is being accessed, read and edited, it behaves in a much faster way than your typical, possibly more choppy version being accessed from the cloud.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOffline and online are no longer separate binary states,\u201d he says. \u201cOur perspective is that online and offline should have\u00a0a much more seamless\u00a0transition.\u201d This is more than just a concept. In action, files in Quip never \u201cdownload\u201d or work in a stuttered way in the cloud.

{"date": ["2014-09-09"], "text": "<p>Confirming <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/apple-wearable-iphone-nfc/\">rumors</a> and leaks, Apple announced this morning that the new iPhone 6 devices will support mobile payments. The feature, which also uses Apple\u2019s Touch ID, will take advantage of NFC technology. That means users will be able to pay for goods and others services in the real world using the payment information already associated with their iTunes accounts.</p><p>That, in fact, is Apple\u2019s biggest advantage in entering the mobile payments market where competitors like PayPal, Google and the mobile carriers\u00a0themselves already offer their own mobile payment solutions, some of which also involve NFC technology.</p><p>Today, Apple has over 800 million registered users, some portion of which will upgrade to the iPhone 6 devices. Though that shift may not happen overnight, eventually users will upgrade as their contracts expire and Apple continues to release new features that draw users in.</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook today said that there are\u00a0$12 billion in daily U.S. transactions, illustrating the size of this business Apple is now stepping into with the launch of Apple Pay.</p><p>\u201cApple Pay will forever change the way all of us buy things,\u201d says Apple CEO Tim Cook. \u201cWe\u2019ve created an entirely new payment process, and we called it Apple Pay.\u201d</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1055576\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/apple0132.jpg?w=680&amp;h=453\" alt=\"apple0132\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\"></p><p><strong>How It Works</strong></p><p>The feature works as the rumors predicted: based on NFC, you just need to tap your phone on a payment terminal and put your finger on the home button for Touch ID.</p><p>In Apple\u2019s payments solution, NFC is located at the top of the iPhone, and users will be able to see all their credit cards in the Passbook application which already includes access to things like tickets and loyalty cards. The card information is stored in the iPhone 6\u2019s new Secure Element chip.</p><p>Users will be able to use the iPhone\u2019s iSight camera to take a picture of the card and add it to Passbook. Then Apple will verify the card. When you add a new credit card, Apple\u00a0doesn\u2019t store the credit card on its own servers, or give it to the merchant, and each time you pay you use a one-time payment card.</p><p>In other words, Apple creates a device-only number so that each payment has a one-time payment number and dynamic security code. Apple stresses that it doesn\u2019t collect payment history \u2013 meaning, it\u2019s not tracking what you\u2019ve purchased. In addition, the \u201cFind my iPhone\u201d feature can now be used to suspend your payment\u00a0cards.</p><p>This focus on privacy plays to Apple\u2019s strengths in that it\u2019s not interested in collecting user data in the same way that other payment providers do.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1055590\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/apple0143.jpg?w=680&amp;h=453\" alt=\"apple0143\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\"></p><p>Merchants also will never see your card numbers, because of the way this solution is implemented \u2013 they just get a transaction number and receive the money.</p><p>6 U.S. banks are supporting the technology at launch, and users will be able to add their AmEx, MasterCard and Visa payment cards.\u00a0220,000 merchant locations are also supported, including\u00a0Macy\u2019s, Bloomingdales, Walgreen\u2019s, Duane Reade, Subway, McDonald\u2019s, Panera Bread, Whole Foods, Staples, The Disney Store, Target, Sephora, and of course the Apple Store. MLB, Instacart, and OpenTable are\u00a0also supporting Apple Pay, as is Groupon.</p><p>Uber has a \u201cRide Now\u201d feature that will let you buy a ride using Apple Pay, without even creating an account.</p><p>Starbucks is another partner for Apple Pay, which is especially interesting because the coffee chain had previously invested in and was implementing Square\u2019s mobile payment technology in their stores. But that rollout did poorly, and we\u2019ve heard a number of rumors that Apple and Square were in M&amp;A discussions (which failed) prior to today\u2019s Apple announcement.</p><p>Apple Pay will be available in the U.S. in October 2014.

But she soon realized that a simple user interface for more complex design tasks could have broader appeal.</p><p>Not everyone has an eye for good design, or is comfortable using professional-level tools like InDesign or Photoshop, but often still needs\u00a0to create graphics for things like slideshows, invitations, handouts, posters, Facebook, cards, collages, blog posts, and much more. That\u2019s where Canva comes in.</p><p>The online service lets users choose from a variety of ready-made templates, graphics, fonts, and photos. Many of the items on its site are free to use, where others let you buy the rights for your one-time use\u00a0for just a dollar \u2013 lower than traditional stock photo sites, in many cases. This fee helps generate revenue both for the designer and Canva.</p><p>What makes Canva so compelling is more than the sum of its parts, however \u2013 it\u2019s the way all of it works together. The system the team has built is so simple that even the novice designer can fudge their way through and still produce a great-looking, professional graphic thanks to the simple toolset and product\u2019s ease-of-use.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1219579\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/canva-brand-templates.jpg?w=680&amp;h=425\" alt=\"Canva Brand Templates\" width=\"680\" height=\"425\"></p><p>In addition, the company has solved a number of challenges around graphics that have been facing today\u2019s marketers, like the need to resize graphics across platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and more.

More recently, however, it looks like he\u00a0took a step back from having a central role at the company. When Google made its\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://investor.google.com/releases/2015/0810.html\">Alphabet split</a>\u00a0this past summer, his chief business officer role was eliminated and he quietly\u00a0became an\u00a0advisor to Alphabet and Google without a specific title.</p><p>This means that it\u2019s unlikely for Google to announce a replacement for Kordestani. Google declined to comment on whether it would be replacing Kordestani in any way.</p><p>Kordestani\u2019s\u00a0appointment to the chairman\u2019s role at Twitter is symbolic. Kordestani\u00a0had been at Google since 1999 \u2014 employee number 11 apparently \u2014 and is credited with being at the helm of the company\u2019s first revenue-generating activities and as\u00a0the person to have brought\u00a0the company into profit for the first time.</p><p>And here\u2019s an interesting twist:\u00a0as speculation was ramping up in the last couple of months\u00a0around who would become Twitter\u2019s head honcho, we\u2019d heard that Twitter had whittled the list down to two: Dorsey and\u00a0someone at Google.

Sources who have worked in Nokia\u2019s developer outreach tell me that the company\u2019s very top execs, along with those at Microsoft, spent many months and many air miles wooing both its owner Facebook and Instagram itself \u2014 offering cash up front, the developer resources to make the app themselves \u2014 and even the first-born kittens from their pet cats (okay maybe not the last one). It was, they believed, one of the essential apps to have on the platform to win over both new smartphone users and migrants from Android and iPhone devices. </p><p>That very strong focus on getting Instagram led to many to think that conversations were progressing between the two sides, leading to false guesses as to when the app might appear. Originally, I have been told, the aim was to try to get the app secured in time for the launch of Nokia\u2019s Lumia 1020, with its 41 Megapixel camera. \u201cThe best photo app for the best photo phone,\u201d was how it was described to me.

The new unified apps, called Office for iOS, are being released along\u00a0with a preview of Office for Android tablets, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/02/microsoft-presses-ahead-with-office-for-android/\">software that has been long-expected</a>. Microsoft intends to allow users, roughly, in the tens of thousands to test its new Android Office tablet apps, to better understand the wildly varied hardware, and software fragmentation facts-of-life that go along with that platform.</p><p>In the updated applications, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/04/microsoft-teams-up-with-dropbox/?ncid=rss&amp;cps=gravity\">promised integration with storage provider Dropbox also comes into effect</a>.</p><p>Prior to the new code, Office on iPhone and for Android tablets\u00a0was a single app on each platform. It was underpowered, poorly reviewed, and a general afterthought. \u00a0The Android set of tablet Office apps will come out of preview in early 2015.</p><p>Microsoft is also loosening the rules on how Office\u2019s mobile apps can be used. When Office was initially released for iPad, the company had very strict rules on who could use its editing tools \u2014 if you were not an Office 365 subscriber, the apps were limited. Now, Office will be up for basic \u201cauthoring\u201d and \u201cediting\u201d by anyone, according to the firm, regardless of whether a user is a paying Office 365 customer or not.</p><p>The change is mildly radical. Microsoft has been slowly peeling away the pay-layer restrictions of Office over\u00a0time. The release of Office Online, for example, came when Microsoft was still happily selling Office apps for desktop in a box, for hundreds of dollars. Even more ironic is that now, all the above free software comes under the same business model auspices. Just head over to Amazon and see\u00a0how much Office can cost.</p><p>Microsoft, asked by TechCrunch, indicated that the touch-friendly version of Office for Windows machines will be released something in-time with Windows 10. Those apps, a build of Office for its own mobile computing platform, are late to market.</p><p>I played with the new iOS Office apps, and found them to be robust, and surprisingly fully-featured. Some features, of course, will be constrained if you are not an Office 365 customer. So, it\u2019s something of a balancing act \u2014 Microsoft wants to provide strong free apps to get and keep users on Office, regardless of where they are working, but, at the same time, wants to keep enough on the paid side to attract new paying users.</p><p>Office 365, on both the consumer and business sides, has been a hit for the company, and a needed one. With its Windows revenues in decline or flat depending on the quarter, and Office\u2019s former business model torched by changes across the software market, Office 365 is\u00a0something akin to a one-shot take. If the company gets it wrong, billions in revenue will fall away.</p>", "title": ["Microsoft Doubles Down On Office For Tablets"], "author": ["Alex Wilhelm"]},

That premise helped mobile investment app startup Robinhood raise the $3 million seed round led by Index Ventures it announced today. With the zero-commission trading it will launch next month, Robinhood is out to prove that young people do care about trading stocks \u2014 it\u2019s just been too expensive for them to invest small sums.</p><p>Robinhood\u2019s tech-fueled, automated approach could change that.</p><p>Wait. Is zero-commission trading even possible? Yes. It doesn\u2019t actually cost a brokerage much money to place a trade. In fact, Robinhood\u2019s found ways to earn money doing it. But decades-old financial companies have been\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.scottrade.com/online-brokerage/trading-fees-commissions.html\">charging</a>\u00a0their users $7 to $10 a trade to pay for their brick-and-mortar retail locations, army of employees, and big profit margins. Robinhood plans to replace all that with a mobile app and a lean engineering team. While it might not get rich quick, it wants to be the Amazon of stock trading by building a huge audience and making just a little off each user.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/18/robinhood-app/\"><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"trade_screen@2x\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/trade_screen2x.png?w=307&amp;h=640\" width=\"307\" height=\"640\">Robinhood first launched in April</a>\u00a0as an iOS app for tracking stocks and sharing predictions of whether they\u2019d rise or fall. It also let users the track record of other people\u2019s predictions and follow those who reliably make the right calls. The crowdsourced stock advice gives users more confidence in their own trading decisions.</p><p>At the time, the Robinhood app was designed to fill a major hole on mobile, where there was no decent native equivalent of Yahoo Finance or Google Finance\u2019s popular websites. Yahoo has since\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/06/yahoo-refreshes-its-finance-service-with-updated-ios-apps-and-a-new-website/\">updated its mobile apps</a>, boxing out Robinhood. The startup ended up pulling its app from the store to redesign it around something big.</p><p>In October after eight months of waiting, Robinhood was approved by finance regulatory agency FINRA to become a broker-dealer. That meant it could add the most important feature missing in its app: the ability to actually buy and sell stocks. It could soon become the first unlimited zero-commission stock brokerage in the world.</p><p>Robinhood will launch free stock trading early next year but you can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.robinhood.io/\">sign up now to be in the first wave of users granted access</a>. In a Mailbox-esque scheme, tweeting about Robinhood will bump up your place in line. There\u2019s clearly big demand for free trading, as Robinhood\u2019s sign up page leaked to Reddit and hit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6906146\">number 1 on HackerNews</a>\u00a0this weekend, bringing in over 10,000 signups in 24 hours.</p><p>Zero-commission trading could bring a new generation of young investors into the stock market. If you\u2019re an old, rich person investing tens of thousands of dollars or more, a $7 fee is pocket change. But if you\u2019re young, on a budget, and only buying $500 of stock, a $7 fee is a steep price to pay. \u201cYou\u2019re losing the amount the stock market appreciates in a year in just commissions\u201d Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev tells me.\u00a0By eliminating the fee, it becomes financially viable for less wealthy people to get into trading.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-932050\" alt=\"Screenshot 2013-12-18 at 6.36.44 AM\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/screenshot-2013-12-18-at-6-36-44-am.png?w=680&amp;h=211\"></p><p>To scale up the zero-commission trading feature, Robinhood needs to hire engineers and designers, so it\u2019s added to its initial funding from Google Ventures. Today it revealed it\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/analyst\">raised $3 million</a> led by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.indexventures.com/blog#post/887\">Index Ventures</a>, and joined by Andreessen Horowitz, Rothenberg Ventures, and angels like Tim Draper, Howard Lindzon, and more from the finance sector. Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt tells me the startup went with Index because \u201cthey were super pasionate about what we were doing. It\u2019s important to share the same enthusiasm for the vision and product.\u201d</p><p>These big name investors weren\u2019t just funding the idea, but the Robinhood team. Tenev and Bhatt were all-stars in their math undergrad programs at Stanford. Disclosure: I know that because I went to college as was friends with them. Tenev even dropped out of the world-renowned UCLA math PhD program to start building finance companies with Bhatt.</p><p>Since 2009, they founded Celeris, an algorithmic trading trading technology startup, and Chronos Research, which sold financial software to top investment banks.\u00a0Along the way Tenev and Bhatt learned how to navigate financial regulation, discovered the massive opportunity in mobile stock trading, and learned how to build it. Robinhood\u2019s trades are executed fast with reliable pricing because these guys had already run an entire business dedicated to low-latency trading. And its compliance team ensures users pay the real market price for stocks with no shady markup.</p><p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-932056\" alt=\"Screenshot 2013-12-18 at 6.39.31 AM\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/screenshot-2013-12-18-at-6-39-31-am.png?w=240&amp;h=197\" width=\"240\" height=\"197\">How will Robinhood make good on its investment if users trade for free? It has a few ideas. First is charging for API access. Once the startup has its trading system humming, it could let other apps build on top of it for a price. Next is charging users to trade on margin \u2014 spending money on credit because their own is still locked up in the three-day waiting period that follows a stock sell. Robinhood will also earn money from what\u2019s called \u201cpayment for order flow\u201d. Essentially, stock exchanges want lots of stock trading volume so people can always find a buyer or seller, so they\u2019re willing to pay a little to get trades executed on their exchange versus another. And eventually, Robinhood could earn interest by holding custody of users\u2019 assets.</p><p>Robinhood will have to battle the big marketing budgets E*Trade, Scottrade, and other big-name consumer brokerages. It will also compete with finance news apps like MarketWatch, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, and Morningstar, but these don\u2019t actually let you buy and sell stocks. Robinhood will also have to stay lean and efficient as it grows so as not to befall <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zecco.com\">the fate of Zecco</a>, a service that offered free trading in 2006 but eventually started charging.</p><p>Code rules the world now, yet the finance sector has been somewhat protected by layers of regulation that discourage startups. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.robinhood.io/\">Robinhood</a> has jumped through the hoops, and they\u2019re just the beginning of the shift.

The smaller version has a 5.2-inch display, while the bigger cousin features a 5.7-inch display. These are OLED displays with a pixel density of 564 ppi and 518 ppi respectively.</p><p><span class=\"message_content\">The Lumia 950 and the XL versions run 20-megapixel cameras with a natural flash. Like on the iPhone 6s,\u00a0both\u00a0can shoot 4K video and include fifth-generation optical image stabilization technology and a dedicated camera button.</span></p><p><span class=\"message_content\">They\u00a0come with 32GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot and a new USB Type-C connector. Finally, you can charge them up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes.</span></p><p>The two devices will ship in November for $549 and $649, with the XL version costing $100 more.</p><p>Panay finally hinted at the power of this device. Why would you need liquid cooling for just a phone? Because it\u2019s more than a phone. You can actually plug your Lumia 950 to a dock and use it with your display, mouse and keyboard. It runs a nearly full version of Windows 10.</p><p>Called Continuum, the dock has an HDMI, DisplayPort and three USB ports. It looks like a good old USB hub, it\u2019s very tiny and easy to put in your bag. The tile interface in the Start menu copies your phone\u2019s start menu so that you get the exact same apps on your computer and on your phone. Universal apps, such as Mail and Word are scaled up version of the mobile apps.</p><p>The demo was very smooth. You can switch between tasks using the regular task switcher. And the best part is that you can still use your phone when your phone is docked. To be clear, this isn\u2019t Windows <i>per se</i> as it runs on an ARM processor, but it is Microsoft\u2019s vision of the future of computing.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/Windows10HardwareEvent\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/windows10hardware-banner.png\" alt=\"Windows 10 Hardware Event\"></a></p>", "title": ["Microsoft Unveils The Lumia 950 And Lumia 950 XL, Two Powerful Windows Phones"], "author": ["Romain Dillet"]},

{"date": ["2013-04-18"], "text": "<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Most people are too scared to seriously play the stock market. Few amateurs know enough to confidently invest on their own. Luckily, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://robinhoodapp.com/\">free iOS app Robinhood</a> launches today to put crowdsourced finance wisdom in your pocket. Track stocks, view advice on what to buy or sell from other users, share your predictions, and build a reputation. Robinhood could turn a new generation into investors.</p><p>But it\u2019s not just for novices. Robinhood was designed to be the best mobile stock-tracking tool in the world. Surprisingly enough, that\u2019s not that difficult. When Robinhood\u2019s founders asked focus groups and financial veterans what they use to research stocks on the web the resounding answer was \u201cYahoo Finance,\u201d but when asked what they used on mobile, most replied \u201c\u2026.\u201d</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"Robinhood Founders Done\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/robinhood-founders-done.png?w=640&amp;h=536\" width=\"640\" height=\"536\"></p><p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-801935\" alt=\"Robinhood Feed\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/robinhood-feed.png?w=288&amp;h=512\" width=\"288\" height=\"512\">That\u2019s why Robinhood\u2019s founders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt set out to combine social investing with a sleek mobile design that\u2019s heavy on gestures. They\u2019re the right guys for the job, since this is their third finance company. Both Stanford grads, Baiju got a master\u2019s in math there too, while Vlad dropped out of UCLA\u2019s prestigious math PhD program so the two could found an\u00a0algorithmic\u00a0trading startup called Celeris. Then they built the financial software company Chronos Research, which worked with major investment banks.</p><p>These experiences revealed the senseless gap in mobile and the unaddressed consumer market.\u201dThink about doing something intelligent with your money,\u201d Bhatt tells me. \u201cWe find a lot of people, especially younger people, don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not that they have some disagreement with entering the stock market, but they don\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d And no one\u2019s really helping. If you look at the top of the finance app charts, you just see things like PayPal, Mint, and various banks\u2019 apps.</p><p>So the goal of Robinhood? To put individual human investment advisors out of business and give their jobs to the crowd who can walk each other through smart bets. And that\u2019s an approach increasingly supported by research. Robinhood is working with teams at Stanford and MIT to prove out theories and early data suggesting crowds perform better in the stock market than even the most skilled individual. That\u2019s convenient for people who don\u2019t have the spare change to hire an advisor.</p><p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-801937\" alt=\"watchlist\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/watchlist1.png?w=336&amp;h=384\" width=\"336\" height=\"384\">When you first join <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://robinhoodapp.com/\">Robinhood</a> and its merry band of investors (currently only on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/analyst-stock-ratings-from/id560378992?mt=8\">iOS</a>), you\u2019ll get suggestions of local and popular stocks to add to your watch list and see friends you can follow. Once finished on-boarding you\u2019ll see your watch list that tracks the performance of the stocks you follow. The News tab pulls in the popular finance articles, which are remarkably up to date and accurate, as well as a personalized stream of articles about your stocks.</p><p>Click into any of your stocks to get more info on their performance stats over time, related news, plus a crowdsourced buy/sell rating. For instance, 69 percent of the Robinhood community rates Google a buy right now.</p><p>If you want to lend your thoughts, the app takes advantage of the touch interface to let you drag your finger across a chart to show how much you think the stock\u2019s price will rise or fall over the coming weeks and months. Then you can add a short comment to support your prediction. For example, you could swipe to say Google will go up 8 percent in the next three months, and explain \u201cThe market is realizing the importance of Glass and self-driving cars, and their synergies with Google\u2019s other businesses.\u201d</p><p>The meat of Robinhood is the Feed, where these predictions show up. You can scroll through a global feed or just recommendations from your friends, and agree, disagree, or comment on them. Rather than a broadcast platform, Robinhood doubles as a social network around stocks, where you can ask people specifically why they made a rating. Overall the app feels slick and professional, which is critical to Robinhood as its success largely depends on trust. The style comes thanks to the design team at Google Ventures, the lead investor in Robinhood. Its seed round was also joined by\u00a0strategic angels including several early members of the executive team from leading electronic market maker GETCO.</p><p><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"user profile\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/user-profile.png?w=327&amp;h=512\" width=\"327\" height=\"512\">But how do you know which Robinhood users to believe? That\u2019s where my favorite feature comes in. If you asked a traditional investment advisor what their track record over time is, Bhatt tells me they\u2019d typically dodge, stating \u201cpast performance is not indicative of future results.\u201d In other words, they get it wrong sometimes, but don\u2019t want you to know.</p><p>Well, guess what, Wall Street? The Internet\u2019s here and it brought its buddy, transparency. Robinhood tracks everyone\u2019s stock price predictions against real-word performance and lays them out on each user\u2019s profile. So you can see someone has rated 107 stocks with 70.42 percent accuracy, an extremely impressive record that earns them a score in the 99th percentile of all Robinhood users, aka, this is someone you might do well to trust.</p><p>The app\u2019s Community tab even offers\u00a0leaderboards\u00a0of the best performing advisors, and suggestions of people to follow. Bhatt explains that along with fostering transparency and trust, the ratings are \u201ca way for people to show they\u2019re smart. That\u2019s a very compelling driver of any action.\u201d During beta tests, a whopping 25 percent of users were contributing predictions. So much participation is very uncommon for user-generated content apps. It seems there\u2019s pent-up demand for a collaborative approach to stock research that a traditional website like Yahoo Finance just can\u2019t provide.</p><p>Robinhood is solid already and it\u2019s just getting started. In the future the company hopes to let you actually buy the stocks you\u2019re betting on. That would take it from its current place competing with Stocktwits\u2019 unstructured micro-advice to more directly battling E*Trade and other mass-market investment mediums. In the meantime, it needs to watch out for buy ratings going viral, which can produce big wins for those who jump on the bandwagon early, but\u00a0excruciating\u00a0losses for those who buy late only to see the price snap back down.</p><p><img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"photo Robinhood graph\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/photo-robinhood-graph.png?w=269&amp;h=300\" width=\"269\" height=\"300\">But what really excites me about Robinhood is how it shifts investing from a game of \u00a0access to a game of talent and cooperation. The stock market has long been the domain of suits who spend all day researching and the clients who can afford to pay them. With this app, finally anyone can get their hunches validated or invalidated by the knowledge of a crowd that\u2019s held accountable to their predictions. While the stock market will always be risky, Robinhood lets you know you\u2019re not alone in facing those risks.</p><p>Tenev explains his app\u2019s name reflects that. \u201cWe understand the connotation of taking something from the rich and giving it to the poor. Robinhood is liberating information that\u2019s locked up with professionals and giving it to the people.\u201d</p><p><em>Download <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/analyst-stock-ratings-from/id560378992?mt=8\">Robinhood for iOS</a></em></p>", "title": ["Win The Stock Market With Crowdsourced Advice From New App Robinhood"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},

Content will include video and images, culled from Twitter, Vine, Periscope and more, and it will be pre-cached in such a way as to load near-instantly when a user clicks on it, minimizing wait time for actually getting at the content.</p><p>The user experience is designed to be immersive, with media fully taking over the screen and presenting video and images in full width. And for logged in users, there\u2019s more functionality: following events will weave related content into your main feed, but only for the duration of the event, automatically shutting things down when it\u2019s concluded.</p><p>For logged out or non-member users, the experience is designed to act as a gateway; users still get a complete experience (minus some of the confusion or sense of missing pieces that can come with stumbling on a tweet without context currently), and are also drawn to participate with their own content or responses to what they see.</p><p>Lightning will focus on both pre-set scheduled events, including things like the NBA Finals, and also on breaking occurrences that arise without warning. We\u2019ve heard from sources familiar with the plans that the company is still working out how much will be hand-curated, and how much will be live-updating directly from Twitter users posting about the events in question.</p><p>Those sources also say to expect exclusive content for Lightning from some of the partners Twitter currently works closely around big events, so that could include events like the Oscars or the Grammys, as well as big major league sports games.</p><p>Live event coverage is already an area where a lot of startups dabble, including products like former live blogging platform ScribbleLive, content curation platform Livefyre, and real-time social media curation app Banjo. Twitter\u2019s network and sub-brands, including Periscope and Vine could give it an edge over those other offerings, however, especially if it makes the experience easy and cheap for media organizations and other content providers to build into their existing websites and apps.</p><p>There\u2019s no specific timeline for a Lightning launch as of yet, but BuzzFeed\u2019s report says there are at least \u201cmonths left.\u201d I\u2019d imagine a launch timed with a big, high-profile event would make the most sense, but which event that ends up being is still very much up in the air.</p>", "title": ["Lightning Is Twitter\u2019s Plan To Be \u2018Event Central\u2019 For Users And Non-Users Alike"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},

The service, which allows Starbucks customers to place orders via the company\u2019s mobile application ahead of arrival at their local\u00a0store, was previously available in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/16/starbucks-mobile-ordering-expands-to-21-more-states-now-live-in-over-4000-stores/\">several thousand locations\u00a0across the U.S.</a>\u00a0while in beta testing for users on iOS devices.</p><p>Today, the company says the service is available in\u00a0more than 7,400 stores, including those in New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Additionally, Mobile Order &amp; Pay is now available to Android users.</p><p>The idea with Mobile Order &amp; Pay is\u00a0to offer customers a faster alternative to waiting in line. Using a simple, touch-based interface, you can\u00a0select food and beverage items from the in-app menu, choose\u00a0which store you\u00a0want to pick up from by referencing an included store list and map, then pay using your\u00a0Starbucks card\u00a0to complete the transaction.</p><p>Cards can also be reloaded in the app as necessary using saved payment card information or Apple Pay.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1213742\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dsc01014.jpg?w=680&amp;h=426\" alt=\"DSC01014\" width=\"680\" height=\"426\"></p><p>When customers\u00a0then arrive at the location, they\u00a0simply walk up to the counter and ask for their\u00a0mobile order. (As a beta tester myself, I found the most difficult part of using the Mobile Order &amp; Pay system has not been the technology \u2013 it\u2019s been the people. Once at\u00a0the store, you have to catch the attention of busy baristas who have your order behind the counter. This is, by far, the slowest part of using Mobile Order &amp; Pay.)</p><p>The company\u00a0has invested for years in mobile technology, making scanning your phone at checkout a common behavior among a sizable customer base.</p><p>Today, there are\u00a0over 16 million active users on Starbucks\u2019 mobile apps on iOS and Android devices. That\u2019s a large audience who\u2019s already used to\u00a0managing payments via their smartphone, so the expansion to mobile ordering was\u00a0a natural next step.</p><p>According to Starbucks, demand for Mobile Order &amp;\u00a0Pay has been high, and represents a growing portion of the\u00a0mobile payments taking place at Starbucks stores. Currently, mobile payments\u00a0account for 20 percent of all in-store transactions across the U.S., a company spokesperson notes, and Starbucks today\u00a0processes nearly nine million mobile transactions each week.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1213741\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/dsc01009.jpg?w=680&amp;h=427\" alt=\"DSC01009\" width=\"680\" height=\"427\"></p><p>However, because the system was\u00a0still in beta testing until today, and not rolled out to all stores or customers, Starbucks declined to reveal metrics related specifically to the adoption of Mobile Order &amp; Pay. But\u00a0the company\u00a0would say that it has seen\u00a0\u201ca significant increase in incrementality and more transactions through Mobile Order &amp;\u00a0Pay\u201d since its debut\u00a0as a pilot program in Portland last\u00a0December. With the expansion to all markets, Starbucks is expecting adoption to grow further.</p><p>Following today\u2019s nationwide\u00a0launch, Starbucks says it will work to bring the mobile ordering system to international markets, beginning with company-owned stores in the U.K. and Canada in October.</p><p>\u201cBringing Mobile Order and Pay to our customers is about meeting their needs of convenience and customization at any time of the day,\u201d said Adam Brotman, Starbucks chief digital officer in a statement this morning. \u201cThe fact that it also represents the fastest technology application rollout we have ever done is indicative of the strength of our digital ecosystem, how well it has been received by both our customers and store partners, and the impact we think it can have on the future of retail,\u201d he added.</p><p>Mobile Order &amp; Pay is only one of several initiatives the company now has\u00a0underway which use\u00a0technology to reach customers in new ways.</p><p>For example, the company plans to begin testing a\u00a0\u201cgreen apron\u201d delivery service\u00a0in New York City at the Empire State Building by the end of 2015.\u00a0This is a web-based ordering system where food and beverage orders are delivered within the building to tenants by the baristas staffing the Starbucks inside the building.</p><p>In addition, Starbucks tells us it will begin testing a street delivery service in Seattle that\u00a0also leverages Mobile Order &amp; Pay. But in this case, instead of customers picking up orders themselves at a nearby store, order deliveries will be executed in partnership with Postmates.</p><p>Both the \u201cgreen apron\u201d service and the street delivery services will be in testing before the end of the year, the company says.</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": ["Starbucks\u2019 Mobile Order & Pay Now Live Nationwide, Delivery Service In Testing By Year-End"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

Balancing in-store and in-app ordering so that both sets of customers are served without too much delay is another potential\u00a0challenge.</p><p>Starbucks has not released any specific data about adoption of MOP in the U.S. yet, nor dollars spent via the in-app pre-order feature \u2014 beyond saying it has seen \u201ca significant increase in incrementality and more transactions\u201d through MOP since its debut\u00a0as a pilot in Portland last\u00a0December \u2014 so it remains to be seen how popular\u00a0the feature is.</p><p>Starbucks already offered a mobile payment option via its app, with a reloadable Starbucks card that\u2019s scanned at check-out to pay for goods. The coffee chain currently has some 16 million-plus active users on its\u00a0mobile apps on iOS and Android.</p>", "title": ["Starbucks\u2019 Mobile Pre-Ordering Goes International With London Launch"], "author": ["Natasha Lomas"]},
{"date": ["2014-08-12"], "text": "<p>When we last checked in with peer-to-peer car rental startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.relayrides.com\">RelayRides</a> about six weeks ago, it had raised $25 million in Series B funding led by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/canaan-partners\">Canaan Partners.</a> Well, it wasn\u2019t quite finished raising money, as it turns out. The company just closed on an additional $10 million in financing led by Trinity Ventures.</p><p>For <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/relayrides\">RelayRides</a>, the decision to take more money so soon after its previous close came mainly as a result of continued interest on the part of investors. It brings total funding to $54 million, with other investors that include August Capital, Google Ventures, and Shasta Ventures.</p><p>The Trinity financing was led by general partner Patricia Nakache, although the firm won\u2019t be taking a board seat along with the deal. (Fun side note: Trinity associate Phil Carter was previously first employee at Wheelz, a car-sharing startup that was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/14/relayrides-acquires-wheelz/\">acquired by RelayRides</a> about a year ago.)</p><p>\u201cWhen we were working on the Series B we received several term sheets, but decided to go with Canaan,\u201d RelayRides CEO Andre Haddad told me last week. Still, the company continued to have a lot of interest from investors and decided that the additional funding would help it as it looks to expand.</p><p>\u201cThis increases our war chest and enables us to be even more aggressive,\u201d Haddad said. The funding will be used for certain product improvements and launches, including the company\u2019s plan to make a native Android app. It will also be used to fund continued geographic expansion of its service, as RelayRides looks to open up a physical presence at more airports around the country.</p><p>Today, RelayRides only has a physical location at just one airport, in its home market of San Francisco. But it\u2019s definitely hoping to open up shop at other airports to offer the same type of concierge service that it has at SFO. And as it looks to do that, the company is also changing its pricing structure in an effort to make the idea of sharing their vehicles more attractive to consumers.</p><p>RelayRides is increasing the amount that it pays to those who make their cars available for rental. The company pays car owners based on the usage of the vehicle while it\u2019s being used, and now those with luxury cars can make up to $0.40 per mile driven when rented out. Regular car owners can make up to $0.20 depending on how new their vehicle is.</p><p>On the rental side, meanwhile, it\u2019s cutting the average daily price in half, as it seeks to drive more consumers to use its service. By doing so, cars start at about $10 a day, which it believes is the lowest price most consumers will be able to find \u2014 especially at the airport.</p><p>The combination of more money going to car owners on the platform and lower prices for consumers who wish to rent them is meant to help increase both supply and demand.</p><p>Airport car rentals are a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/24/airport-car-rentals-please-god-someone-make-them-not-suck/\">$10 billion a year business</a>, so there\u2019s plenty of room for RelayRides to grow in that market. But it\u2019s not alone: Y Combinator-backed startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flightcar\">FlightCar</a> is also offering peer-to-peer rentals available at airports, and is currently in three markets.</p><p>You can expect RelayRides to move aggressively to new markets in the coming months, opening up lots where travelers can park their cars and rent them out. It\u2019s part of the company\u2019s larger strategy to extend the long-term rental part of its business, as it has moved from hourly rentals to focus on daily, weekly, and monthly rentals.</p><p>According to Haddad, offering the company\u2019s valet service at SFO has increased the approval rate when users request a ride by up to 25 percent. Making it available in other places could help accelerate growth in those markets.</p>", "title": ["RelayRides Adds $10 Million From Trinity And Looks To Expand Peer-To-Peer Airport Rentals"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},
{"date": ["2014-09-04"], "text": "<p>Apple could be gearing up to make its so-called \u2018iWatch\u2019 a payment device powered by NFC, according to a new report from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-to-allow-mobile-payments-1409845551?mod=e2tw\">Wall Street Journal</a>. But including near-field communications tech in the iWatch (and the iPhone 6, too, if the report is correct) will open the door for much more than just payments, and could make the wearable an authentication device that finally convinces the consumer market wrist-based computing is something to get excited about.</p><p>WSJ says that the watch using NFC is a signal that it will factor significantly into its mobile payments play, which is rumored to be introduced at next week\u2019s event. Watchers have long pegged Apple as readying a mobile payments program, that would let them pay for goods and other things using their existing iTunes Store accounts, and now that functionality is also apparently going to come to their wearable alongside its introduction with the new iPhone next week.</p><p>Other details revealed in the new report reflect earlier suggestions that the watch will have two different screen-sizes, and a curved LED display, along with a bevy of sensors to track a user\u2019s health and activity. In a separate report, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/technology/apple-smartwatch-and-bigger-iphones-to-be-introduced.html?_r=0\">New York Times claims</a> that the new iWatch will be able to track footsteps and heartrate, with much higher accuracy than the current crop of devices. It will have a flexible display panel, they say, and use wireless charging. It\u2019ll work with HealthKit and use Handoff to let it resume activities begun on iOS and OS X devices, and vice versa, and both phones and iWatch will use NFC.</p><p>With multiple sources agreeing on these basic facts, the potential for Apple\u2019s wearable starts to take shape. Earlier, I\u2019d struggled with finding a good reason to justify their entrance to this market. A payments component goes some way to help it make sense, and Apple has reportedly worked with credit card companies to ensure low fees for its use, but just the inclusion of NFC and the potential for a wearable as a convenience device that offers true cross-platform communication is a bigger selling point.</p><p>Imagine an iWatch that is a true companion, speaking to Mac and iOS devices as an assurance that a user is who they say it is \u2013 without the need for arduous processes like manual entry of passwords. That\u2019s a big step up in terms of providing genuine convenience. Other gadgets like the Bionym Nymi authenticator band look to provide this kind of persistent identification, but Apple could achieve much of the same thing with its own wearable, removing steps and reducing friction from processes ranging from payments, to controlling a smart home (via its new HomeKit features for iOS 8), to surfacing loyalty cards and tickets via PassBook.</p><p>An iWatch with the same basic feature set as Android Wear isn\u2019t exciting, even if it does share ties with iOS devices like the iPhone. What is exciting, in terms of the potential of a wearable to finally achieve mass market adoption, is companion hardware that makes the experience of using all other computing devices, including emerging categories like connected home gadgets, easier. As it stands, most wearables introduce a degree of complication; if Apple can simplify, as it has a habit of doing, instead of asking users to learn and make a habit out of something new, it should have a winner on its hands.</p>", "title": ["Apple\u2019s NFC Payments Play Could Make Its Wearable A Computing Friction Killer"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},

A few hours, right? <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nucleusscientific.com/\">Nucleus Scientific </a>revealed a solution onstage today at TechCrunch Disrupt NY that can charge a phone in minutes. With this technology, the company aims to allow a Tesla can be fully recharged in the amount of time it takes to pump a tank of gas.</p><p>The company says its suite of battery technologies, called Intelligent Energy System, can change the way energy is stored and transferred while also extending the life of the battery, and is ready to be applied to batteries in the next generation of devices.</p><p>The promise is radical yet the company\u2019s founders have a long history in this field. Ian Hunter founded Nucleus Scientific in 2007 and is the Hatsopoulos Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT and head of the Bioinstrumentation Laboratory.</p><p>The rest of the team is a mix of PhDs in chemistry, physics and engineering, and many are from MIT. Disrupt NY is the firm\u2019s first public demonstration after operating under the radar for the last eight years; it\u00a0revealed an engineering prototype power bank to demonstrate its\u00a0advancements.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1152071\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/img_9550.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" alt=\"Nucleus Scientific\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><p>The company wants to license the patented technology and is\u00a0already in talks with several established companies about incorporating their hardware and software solution into existing and future product lines.</p><p>This power bank is similar to others on the market but features radically different capabilities. It\u2019s incredible, really. The 10,000 mAh engineering prototype can fully charge in 15 minutes instead of the hours usually required. That means the power bank is pulling and storing enough energy from a standard wall outlet at a rate that would recharge a smartphone in three minutes.</p><p>The company also produced a working system for an electric scooter battery. Traditionally, to charge a battery required for a 12km ride would take 280 minutes; it\u2019s only 10 minutes with Nucleus Scientific\u2019s solution.</p><p>Nucleus Scientific\u2019s Intelligent Energy System marries hardware breakthroughs with custom software to achieve their results. The complete system of custom batteries, sensors, feedback control systems and algorithms not only allows for unheard of charge times, but also extends the life of the battery.</p><p>The company constructed a large battery testing facility to build-out this technology. In the lab, the company recharged 14,000 mAh batteries (equal to nine\u00a0smartphones) in 100 seconds. But if the charge time is increased to three minutes, the company was able to double the life of the battery.</p><p>Today, the most commonly used method to charge batteries is called Constant-Current Constant-Voltage (CCCV). Its recharging scheme is hard on batteries, ultimately limiting its life. Instead of applying a constant current to the batteries like in CCCV, real-time monitoring of the battery is used to regulate the voltage charging the battery, extending the life of the battery. The efficiency of the system even allows for the design of radically smaller power chargers, reducing the size of a standard 100W power converter by a factor of six times.</p><p>Nucleus Scientific says the technology is ready to be applied to various configurations of lithium-ion and lithium polymer batteries. The concept isn\u2019t limited to small batteries, either \u2014 the firm says they plan to scale the technology from smartphone batteries to electric vehicles.</p><p>Batteries are often the limiting factor of portable devices and Nucleus Scientific seemingly has a solution that will unlock the full potential of everything from smartphones to lanterns to medical equipment.</p>", "title": [], "author": []},

But how those dollars will actually get into the hands of the entrepreneurs who need them the most is still unclear.</p><p>If these commitments are to have optimal impact,\u00a0investors, leaders and\u00a0founders must be strategic about tackling some of the not so obvious ways that <span class=\"il\">women</span> of <span class=\"il\">color</span> are pushed out of the investment pipeline.</p><p>The unique challenges faced by <span class=\"il\">women</span> of <span class=\"il\">color</span> are substantial and, to some extent, structural.

Here are three ways to begin to resolve the issue.</p><p>The first step is to address what\u00a0Arlo\u00a0Gilbert called \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/%40arlogilbert/silicon-valley-s-dirty-secret-67b1f0efdce\">Silicon\u00a0Valley\u2019s Dirty Secret</a>.\u201d Essentially, he asserts, investment deals are sourced and funded only through a network of people who know and trust each other.

Venture capitalists rely on their friends, their networks and their associates \u2014\u00a0most of whom run in the same socio-economic circles \u2014 for referrals and references.</p><p>Firms must expand their tentacles and create deeper alliances with <span class=\"il\">initiatives </span>that support minority founders, such as\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.avionventures.com/\">Avion Accelerator</a>\u00a0for Latinas,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://latinostartupalliance.org/\">Latino Startup Alliance</a>\u00a0(<i>full disclosure, I am on their board</i>) and Wayne Sutton\u2019s\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://buildup.vc/\">BUILDUP</a>. And, for the record, these organizations\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/funding-diverse-startup-founders#/story\">also struggle to find support</a>.</p><p>The other side of the <span class=\"il\">tech</span> entrepreneur dilemma is lack of access to <span class=\"il\">tech</span> talent. While it is arguable whether the\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/28/trying-to-hire-a-diverse-team-of-engineers-its-not-just-a-pipeline-issue/\"><span class=\"il\">tech</span> talent crisis</a>\u00a0is a pipeline issue or a hiring issue, both issues impact <span class=\"il\">women</span> of <span class=\"il\">color</span> entrepreneurs. Startup companies are more likely to succeed when they have an ex-Googler on staff, and they are most likely to fail if they don\u2019t have a <span class=\"il\">tech</span> co-founder.</p><p>We need more <span class=\"il\">initiatives</span> that create opportunities to pair <span class=\"il\">tech</span> talent with emerging companies founded by non-<span class=\"il\">tech </span>founders.\u00a0 And as a non-<span class=\"il\">tech</span> founder, I can attest that going to meet-ups and hackathons is not effective in finding a developer to come work with you for equity, especially given the tight market for talent.</p><p>The\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/09/fact-sheet-president-obama-launches-new-techhire-initiative\">White House <span class=\"il\">Tech</span> Hire Initiative</a> \u2014\u00a0the government\u2019s answer for getting people into coding school\u00a0\u2014\u00a0could be hacked to support diverse entrepreneurs.\u00a0Just this week,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sabio.la/\">Sabio.la</a>, a Los Angeles-based software engineering program working with the White House, announced a new\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/04/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-new-commitments-investors-companies\"><span class=\"il\">Women</span> of\u00a0<span class=\"il\">Color</span> Coding Fellowship</a>\u00a0that will inevitably make a difference for <span class=\"il\">women</span> of <span class=\"il\">color</span> founders.</p><p>Launching a startup is risky any way you cut it, but for <span class=\"il\">women</span> of <span class=\"il\">color</span>, especially those who are the bread winners in their families, the risk is immense.</p><p>The famed startup story of quitting your job, moving to Silicon Valley and living on ramen until your first seed round is touted as a badge of honor in the startup world. But the economics of this is clearly for those with a strong safety net.</p><p>It is not unheard of for a startup to receive a friends and family round of support in the six-figures or to rely on significant others during the transition. Given the sacrifice so many <span class=\"il\">women</span> of <span class=\"il\">color</span> endure just to get a good-paying job, it is improbable that any professional woman would leave her job security for an extremely unstable stint in Silicon Valley.</p><p>In a recent a conversation in the Female Founders group, more than half of the <span class=\"il\">women</span> said they relied on savings to launch their startup.

The company\u2019s more-than-three-hour keynote at its Build conference today covered a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/build2015/\">range of products</a>: Office, Windows, Azure, and the unreleased HoloLens holographic headset and operating system.</p><p>HoloLens, it\u2019s now clear, is not vaporware. Microsoft promised the assembled developers that it had more than a 100\u00a0HoloLens nerd helmets on-site for them to try. So, the theory that holographic Windows was some sort of premature April Fool\u2019s joke, is out the window.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140809104738/jedipedia/de/images/a/a7/JabbaPortrait.jpeg\">Myself</a> and\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/fredericl\">Frederic Lardinois</a> hung around after the event to kick over a few things on camera. In case you missed the chaos, here is our recap.</p><p>What\u2019s clear is that Microsoft wants developers to build for Windows, but it\u2019s now giving them more tools than ever to do so, including new tools for <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/29/microsoft-makes-it-easier-for-developers-to-bring-their-android-and-ios-apps-to-windows-10/\">porting Android and iOS apps</a> to its Windows 10 platform. It also made a new (and free) <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/29/microsoft-shocks-the-world-with-visual-studio-code-a-free-code-editor-for-os-x-linux-and-windows/\">code editor</a> available to developers that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, something that was unthinkable only a few years ago.</p><p>We didn\u2019t hear all that much new about Windows 10 today, but maybe that\u2019s understandable, given that Microsoft has been releasing new public betas of its latest operating system at a steady clip. We were a bit surprised, though, that the company didn\u2019t announce a release date for Windows 10 yet.</p><p>Tomorrow, this publication is back onsite, covering the continuing developer confab. Unlike today, though, we don\u2019t expect the company to make any major announcement.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/build2015/\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/msft-build2015-banner.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>", "title": ["Microsoft Goes Big On Cross-Platform Development And HoloLens"], "author": ["Alex Wilhelm", "Frederic Lardinois"]},

Part fitness band, part computer, part mobile Twitter and stock-checking smartgadget, the Band is a mix of things.</p><p>And it pretty much works. It\u2019s still a bit clunky, as you might expect from first-generation hardware, but I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by the Band.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1077758\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/watchpics-14.jpg?w=680&amp;h=453\" alt=\"watchpics-14\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\"></p><p>Most importantly, it doesn\u2019t do just one thing. If it were\u00a0a fitness-only device, I wouldn\u2019t use it. If it only had a few lightweight apps, I wouldn\u2019t use it. If it were\u00a0just a sleep tracker, or a heart-rate monitor, I wouldn\u2019t use it. But with those features combined, it does enough to fit into my daily flow.</p><p>That\u2019s to say that wearing something on your wrist is annoying. Having something else to keep charge is annoying. And having one more damn screen in your life is annoying. So, any device that wants to take up that spot has to more than balance out the debits that it will make on your arms and psyche.</p><p>Part of the new Microsoft Health platform, Band is a capable and fun device. For $200 it does quite a lot. Once more apps are available for the gadget, and the hardware reaches its second generation, the company could have a pretty popular little doodad on its wrists.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1077759\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/watchpics-11.jpg?w=680&amp;h=453\" alt=\"watchpics-11\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\"></p>", "title": ["Hands On With Microsoft\u2019s New Fitness Wearable, The Band"], "author": ["Alex Wilhelm"]},
{"date": ["2015-04-30"], "text": "<p>Microsoft\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us\">HoloLens</a> is no joke. We\u2019ve now tried the company\u2019s latest revision of its unreleased augmented reality headset and even built an app for it. The new hardware, which Microsoft also showcased during its Build developer conference keynote yesterday, feels very solid and the user experience (mostly) delivers on the company\u2019s promises.</p><p>Earlier today, Microsoft gave developers and some of us media pundits\u00a0a chance to spend some quality time with HoloLens by building our own \u201cholographic application\u201d using the Unity engine and Visual Studio.</p><p>HoloLens is all about augmented reality. It\u2019s about placing objects into the real world, which you can still see while you\u2019re wearing the headset. It\u2019s not a virtual reality headset like the Oculus Rift, so it\u2019s not about total immersion. Instead, it lets you see objects on a table in front of you that aren\u2019t there in the real world, for example, and it lets you interact with them as if they were real objects.</p><p>When you first see somebody who is\u00a0using HoloLens, you\u2019ll probably think something is wrong with them. They\u2019ll walk around\u00a0things you can\u2019t see, make random click gestures in the air (\u201cair-tapping\u201d is what Microsoft calls that) and probably ooh and ahh a few times.</p><p>Until you\u2019ve used HoloLens \u2014 and very few people have \u2014 this all sounds very abstract. But once you strap it on and use it, it\u2019s indeed a bit of a revelation.</p><p>The early (and highly positive reviews) from <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/21/microsofts-new-holographic-nerd-helmet-is-awesome/\">Microsoft\u2019s January event</a>, where a few select members of the press got to try it, weren\u2019t an exaggeration.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151603\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/microsoft-hololens-hardware.jpg?w=950&amp;h=391\" alt=\"Microsoft HoloLens hardware\" width=\"950\" height=\"391\"></p><p>Let me walk you through the experience Microsoft put on for us today.\u00a0After locking all of our electronic devices in a locker (even\u00a0smartwatches),\u00a0Microsoft paired us up with a mentor who would walk us through the rest of the experience.</p><p>We all got our own HoloLens and a PC to code on and four members of the team walked us through building a simple HoloLens app. First, though, they taught us how to use the basic gestures that work across all apps: air clicks (for selecting stuff); gazes (which is really just about looking at things); and voice commands (which developers can easily customize).</p><p>With that out of the way, we loaded a couple of preset assets into Unity, made a few minor modifications to the scene, and then exported everything to Visual Studio. From there, deploying the app to the HoloLens (over USB) was just a matter of\u00a0a few clicks.</p><p>The scene Microsoft had pre-built was a sketchbook\u00a0with a few cubes on top of it, two paper airplanes that leaned\u00a0against the cubes,\u00a0and two paper balls that were suspended in the air over them (so they could bounce off the paper airplanes).</p><p>We started with a very basic, static scene and then added more interactivity from there. At every step, we would go to Unity, add new features, deploy the app and strap on the HoloLens again to take another look at our creation.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151609\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2i8a96951.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" alt=\"2I8A9695\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><p>At its most basic, the Unity SDK allows you to simply place an object at a certain distance and height from where the device is pointing at when you initialize the application. That object is then suspended in that spot in space and you can walk around it.</p><p>We then added a bit of interactivity so the balls would drop when you clicked on them, as well as sound and \u2014 finally \u2014 the HoloLens\u2019 ability to detect objects in the world and have the whole scene and the dropping balls interact with it.\u00a0Because HoloLens knows what you\u2019re looking at \u2014 and uses that to allow developers to place a small 3D cursor into the scene \u2014 you can easily use air clicks or voice commands to interact with objects.</p><p>That\u2019s really what HoloLens is about, too. We were able to drop the scene on a table for example. Then the balls would drop and roll off the sketchbook. So far so good, but the balls\u00a0also dropped off the real table and maybe got stuck against the sofa next to it. That\u2019s very impressive, because that kind of real-world mapping is hard to do.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151615\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2i8a97551.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" alt=\"2I8A9755\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><p>HoloLens constantly scans the world around you and then builds a (somewhat crude) model of it. That\u2019s how it knows where the ground is, for example. It doesn\u2019t know that a table is a table, but it does know that there\u2019s a flat surface there.\u00a0The same goes for any other kind of objects.</p><p>While I originally assumed HoloLens \u2014 like most other augmented reality applications \u2014 needs some kind of QR code or markers to know where to place objects, it can actually recognize the world around you and then allows you to place objects where you want them. Using the Unity physics engine, it can interact with them.</p><p>For the grand finale, we added a new object to the scene that would explode when one of the balls hit it \u2014 and which then revealed a cavernous world underneath\u00a0the floor with a stream and animated birds. That was obviously the most impressive demo and really showed the potential of HoloLens. You could even drop the balls into that cavern and see them bounce 20\u00a0feet beneath your feet.</p><p>The new hardware we used felt very solid and unlike the first prototypes, it\u2019s an untethered, standalone unit. You use a headband to strap the device to your face, and while the device is not exactly light, the smart weight distribution between the front and back makes up for that.</p><p>Microsoft admonished us to be careful with the units, but they didn\u2019t feel fragile at all.\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this model turned out to be very close to the final production unit.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151611\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2i8a97021.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" alt=\"2I8A9702\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><p>Going into the demo, I was\u00a0especially interested in how well the holograms would lock into place. That, after all, is very hard to do, and if objects start randomly moving around as you walk around them, it\u2019s hard to feel like they were really there. I was surprised how well this worked. I found myself trying to kick the little paper balls with my foot after they had rolled off the table (but sadly, the algorithms are clearly not quite fast enough yet for this kind of real-time interaction).</p><p>There is, however, still a little bit of jitter to the holograms that is mostly noticeable when you get close to them. They really feel like they\u2019re locked in place, though, and that\u2019s the real achievement here, especially given that Microsoft is not using any markers for placing them. You can randomly move objects around in space. They will stay put. No QR codes necessary.</p><p>My best guess is that Microsoft is using one (or more) of Movidius\u2019 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.movidius.com/our-technology/myriad-2-platform/\">Myriad 2 vision processing chips</a> in the device to be able to do the positional tracking necessary to enable all of this.</p><p>The one disappointment for me in trying HoloLens was\u00a0that the field of view was very\u00a0limited. This was not a totally immersive experience because objects\u00a0would\u00a0get cut off long before you would naturally expect them to drop out of sight.\u00a0Some of the writers who saw Microsoft\u2019s first demo told me that they felt the viewing angle on\u00a0these new devices was smaller than during the first demo. I can\u2019t verify that, though.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151626\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/hololens.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=693\" alt=\"hololens\" width=\"1024\" height=\"693\"></p><p>What did surprise me, though, was how little opacity there was to the holograms. I expected them to look somewhat transparent, with the background shining through. That really wasn\u2019t the case, though. They looked really solid and there was almost no transparency.</p><p>Today\u2019s demo obviously happened in a\u00a0controlled environment, but it was nowhere as controlled as I expected. People moved around as four or five of us gathered around a table to look at our holograms and everything still worked really well.</p><p>At the end of the session, I came away very impressed. When I first heard about HoloLens, I thought this was a technology that was still very far away from being production-ready and I assumed that the demos Microsoft showed earlier this year were simply well-staged and had managed to pull the wool over the assembled tech press. Now, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Microsoft started selling HoloLens within a year (the company, of course, won\u2019t say when HoloLens will go on sale or at what price).</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151602\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/microsoft-hololens-hardware-1.jpg?w=619&amp;h=379\" alt=\"Microsoft HoloLens hardware-1\" width=\"619\" height=\"379\"></p>", "title": ["HoloLens Hands-On: How We Built An App For Microsoft\u2019s Augmented Reality Headset"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},

{"date": ["2012-11-24"], "text": "<p>If you travelled by air for the wonderful holiday weekend, you might have been faced with the hell that is the typical airport car rental experience. There are the lines, the hassles, the constant upsells, confusion around cost of gas and insurance, and about 15 pages of paper that you have to sign before being able to pick out your car and leave the lot. Frequent travelers and members of rewards programs aren\u2019t treated that differently. They have a shorter line and can generally have a better choice of available cars from the lot, but the experience isn\u2019t fundamentally better.</p><p>Airport car rentals are a big business \u2014 more than $10 billion a year, by some estimates \u2014 but the experience is pretty bad all around. Which means it\u2019s time for disruption! Time for the incumbent car rental agencies to get some competition from nimbler startups with new ideas, processes, and ways of doing things better! Thankfully, there are a few promising young companies working on this problem, and they could be coming soon to an airport near you.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of travelers leave their cars in long-term parking lots while they\u2019re away on vacation or business. But what if, instead of paying to park in those lots, they were able to get paid while they were out of town? And what if instead of paying high rates to rent a vehicle from one of the incumbent car rental agencies, you could get discounted rentals on someone else\u2019s car while you\u2019re traveling in a different city? That\u2019s the idea behind <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://flightcar.com/\">Flightcar</a>, which seeks to create a marketplace model for airport rentals.</p><p>Flightcar isn\u2019t much different from on-demand car rental marketplaces like Getaround or RelayRides \u2014 except that while they primarily focus on short-term, hourly rentals in urban areas, Flightcar is more for multi-day rentals. And while Getaround and RelayRides have their inventory spread out across a city, Flightcar users would only be able to pick up their cars from partnering parking lots near an airport.</p><p>Those renting out a car would simply drop it off at an airport parking lot in the same way that they usually would, and shuttle to the terminal. But when they return, they could be issued a check for the time that their car was rented while away. If it wasn\u2019t rented while they were away, they would simply pay the parking fee instead.</p><p>The startup not only provides the marketplace for listing and renting autos, but also cleans cars before and after a car is rented and provides necessary insurance and support for drivers while they are renting. It also provides supplemental insurance for all vehicles that have been rented through its system.</p><p>Flightcar co-founder Shri Ganesham told me that there were approximately 360,000 cars parked in airport parking at any given time, collecting fees. So there\u2019s a potentially huge inventory of cars that are just waiting to be used. The hard part comes in aggregating that inventory, and matching up potential drivers with rides, since the amount of time varies for travelers on both sides of the transaction. Flightcar is on track to launch soon in Oakland and San Jose airports and expects to expand quickly thereafter.</p><p>If Flightcar is Airbnb for airport rentals, then <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.silvercar.com/\">Silvercar</a> is more like Uber, providing a more expensive, but more convenient process than incumbent options. The startup uses a mobile app to process reservations, pick up and drop off of cars in airport rental lots, and expedite the actual process of renting a vehicle.</p><p>Silvercar strips out a lot of the complexity associated with getting a rental, in part because it only has one model of car that it rents out \u2014 the Audi A4. There\u2019s no upsell on car class, and customers will always know what kind of car they\u2019re going to get. Rates will be competitive, but could be slightly more than the cost of full-size vehicles at the incumbents. But what customers pay more for in price is made up for in convenience.</p><p>Customers won\u2019t have to worry about getting gouged for gas at 3x the price for bringing a car back with a half-empty tank, for instance: Since cars are connected to the cloud, they\u2019ll merely report back how empty or full the tank is, and automatically charge users for refills based on the market rate for gas. Customers will also have a limited number of insurance options to choose from, rather than having to navigate the confusing choices that more car rental agencies provide.</p><p>Silvercars will be available in the same consolidated rental lots as the traditional car rental agencies, but the process for checking a car out will be completely different: Rather than waiting in line to talk to an agent about a rental, users will be able to reserve through a mobile app, which can also be used to unlock the car to start driving.</p><p>The startup plans to open for business at one airport at the end of this year, and then expand to about one new airport per quarter. It\u2019s raised $11.5 million from investors like Austin Ventures, Crunchfund, SV Angel, Dave Morin, Chris Dixon, and others.</p>", "title": ["Airport Car Rentals: The Next $10 Billion Industry Ready For Disruption"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

The question is whether Snapchat can sustain that casual attitude while playing the secret postman, pinging your friends to drive you, and it, more Story views.</p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1052406 aligncenter\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/snapchat-notification.png?w=640&amp;h=157\" alt=\"Snapchat Notification\" width=\"640\" height=\"157\"></p><p>Previously, Snapchat had been one of the most conservative and respectful social apps when it came to interrupting you. No shallow alerts that someone Liked your photo, viewed your profile, or retweeted your quip. It only tugged your pant leg when someone sent something straight to you.</p><p>But social is a battle for eyeballs, and no one else showed such restraint. Twitter and Facebook will use any excuse to send you a push or email, with Twitter getting more brazen as of late, telling you when friends all followed someone or a few people were discussing a TV show or current event. Snapchat is well within its bounds to get a bit more aggressive.</p><p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-1052403\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/how-to-post-a-snapchat-story.png?w=287&amp;h=522\" alt=\"How To Post A Snapchat Story\" width=\"287\" height=\"522\">Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence I\u2019ve collected suggests early core Snapchat users might be sending fewer direct snaps lately. I\u2019m getting far fewer per day than I did a year ago, my friends report the same, and several have told me their younger family members who were formerly addicted are becoming less keen to blast out funny faces, drawings, and random windows into their life.</p><p>Snapchat Stories is thriving, with over 1 billion views per day as of June in part thanks to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://time.com/3002803/snapchat-stars/\">burgeoning community of creators</a> who\u2019ve become Snapchat celebrities (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/09/snapchat-celebrities/\">as I predicted last year</a>). It\u2019s also a potential <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/24/facebook-steals-features-snapchat-steals-talent/\">gateway to monetization</a>\u00a0via <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/21/snapchat-our-story/\">Our Stories</a>, which just got their own <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/29/snapchat-steps-on-twitters-toes-lets-you-follow-remote-events-live/\">dedicated section</a> in the app. Yet they\u2019re often viewed after someone returns to the app from a direct snap notification. If those pushes dry up, Stories could get fewer incidental views.</p><p>And so, Story pushes. A sign Snapchat may be shifting its priority to making Stories a strong, independent product that don\u2019t need no direct snaps to get by. Most people think of Snapchat as photos that last 10-seconds or less. But the rise of Stories could make their 24-hour self-destruct timer the new standard.</p>", "title": ["Snapchat Pushes You To Watch Friends\u2019 Stories"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},
{"date": ["2013-05-14"], "text": "<p>There\u2019s consolidation afoot in the peer-to-peer car rental space. San Francisco-based RelayRides, which launched about five years ago and is now available nationwide, has gobbled up fledgling competitor Wheelz. That includes all the assets, IP, and about 10 employees from Wheelz, which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/28/wheelz-automotive-veterans-launch-p2p-car-sharing-platform-backed-by-former-facebook-vp/\">launched about a year-and-a-half ago</a>.</p><p>The acquisition was announced as RelayRides is seeing record growth in its peer-to-peer car sharing marketplace. It now has cars in more than 1,500 cities across the U.S. since <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/05/relayrides-national-launch/\">launching nationally a year ago</a>. Over that time, it\u2019s also seen rental reservation hours and active listings both increase more than 500 percent.</p><p>But RelayRides believes that it can accelerate that growth by bringing on the assets and the technical expertise of the Wheelz team. Unlike RelayRides, which enables car owners to list their cars and hand off keys, Wheelz requires that they install a piece of hardware into their cars. Its proprietary DriveBox technology would then enable renters to unlock the vehicles and get access to them without having to meet owners to hand off keys.</p><p>On the one hand, that gave users more instant access to Wheelz\u2019s inventory of cars. On the other hand, it slowed down the startup\u2019s ability to expand into new markets. At the time of the acquisition, Wheelz was available in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and on some university campuses in California.</p><p>For Wheelz, the combination with RelayRides will enable it to bring its technology and user experience to more renters around the country. According to RelayRides CEO Andre Haddad, Wheelz has been working on lower-cost hardware that would make DriveBox technology more widely available to RelayRides listers.</p><p>That will enable RelayRides to better reach its most passionate users. Haddad, who was formerly an executive at eBay and Shopping.com, compared RelayRides\u2019 dependence on so-called \u201csuper users\u201d to his days at eBay, where about 5 percent of users made up about half of all revenues.</p><p>In the same way, RelayRides will be able to leverage Wheelz hardware to facilitate rentals from its own super users. By looking at its inventory of cars and seeing which car owners are most active, RelayRides will be able to pick which are likely to make the most out of that hardware investment. Wheelz founder and CEO Jeff Miller also said there could be an opportunity to have car owners pay for their own equipment.</p><p>Either way, the idea is to make car sharing a more seamless experience for both car owners and renters. Installing Wheelz hardware is one way that RelayRides does this. Another way that it\u2019s simplified the rental process is through a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/05/car-sharing-startup-relayrides-partners-with-gm/\">partnership with GM and OnStar</a> to let renters gain access to cars by connecting with the automaker\u2019s on-board computer and unlock doors, control and track the vehicles that have been rented.</p><p>Over the next several years, Miller expects more OEMs to provide access through OnStar-like integrations. In the meantime, though, the Wheelz hardware will make car sharing a lot more accessible to users who don\u2019t have cars produced by GM or other manufacturers with similar technology.</p><p>Wheelz had <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/22/strategic-sharing-zipcar-leads-13-7m-investment-in-campus-car-sharing-startup-wheelz/\">raised $13.7 million</a> ahead of its launch in San Francisco and L.A. last year. RelayRides, meanwhile, has raised a total of $13 million since being founded in 2008.</p><p>While they wouldn\u2019t really disclose the terms of the deal, executives said that Wheelz investors \u2014 such as Zipcar and Fontinalis Partners \u2014 would become shareholders in the combined entity. As part of the acquisition, RelayRides receive all assets and IP from Wheelz, and 10 employees will be joining the team. Wheelz founder Miller will remain on through the transition, and afterward will serve as an advisor and shareholder in the combined company.</p>", "title": ["RelayRides Acquires Wheelz To Boost Inventory And Improve Hardware For Its Peer-To-Peer Car Rentals"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

Kunal Agarwal is an entrepreneur in residence at Giant Pixel.\u00a0</em></p><p>2014 will be remembered as the year that wearables leapt into the Silicon Valley mainstream. \u00a0Tech giants like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Intel, Qualcomm have taken notice and poured money and resources into developing their own offerings.</p><p>Earlier players like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fitbit.com/start\">Fitbit</a> and<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://jawbone.com/\"> Jawbone</a> announced multiple new products and a host of promising startups (Athos, Atlas, Misfit, etc.) have emerged with innovative offerings.</p><p>With the momentum of these dollars and product releases, its no wonder industry analysts are predicting the wearable movement to be \u201cthe next big thing\u201d. \u00a0Credit Suisse estimates the market could be $50 billion in 5 years, and Morgan Stanley claims the wearable market could reach $1.6 <em>trillion</em> in value.</p><p>Those of us closer to the leading edge know that in their current state, wearables have next to no chance of attaining these lofty predictions. The big ugly secret of the current wearable market is that over a third of users who own a wearable device <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://endeavourpartners.net/assets/Endeavour-Partners-Wearables-and-the-Science-of-Human-Behavior-Change-Part-1-January-20141.pdf\">stop using it within 6 months</a>. Certainly, price and the lack of design aesthetic contribute to this lack of retention. However, the main culprit is that despite manufacturers\u2019 claims that these are \u201csmart devices\u201d most wearable products aren\u2019t intelligent at all.</p><p>Granted, there\u2019s a certain novelty consumers feel when they are first able to track the number of steps they take in a day, their sleep patterns, or heart rate. But after some time, the lack of any meaning or insight attached to the data means it just becomes another graph to view. \u00a0Consumers don\u2019t want data dumps \u2014 they want actionable information. This is why a wearable soon becomes just another gadget left in the drawer.</p><p>In 2015, the wearable market will reach a critical inflection point where it will gain mass market adoption (close to 20% of adults will have one by EOY \u2013 double the 10% seen now) and set itself on massive growth trajectory for the next 5 years. This key moment will hinge less on innovations in hardware, and more on the software and networks that make sense of all that data emitted by the devices. To succeed, wearables must expand from feeds of <em>information</em> to recommendations and other actionable health <em>knowledge</em>.</p><p>By now the pattern of platform companies, APIs, and independent developers is clear. We should expect <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/health/\">Apple HealthKit</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fit.google.com/u/0/\">Google Fit</a>, and similar efforts by Jawbone and Fitbit to drive innovative applications to combine personal fitness data with expertise in exercise, nutrition, and even sleep and relaxation to efficiently move participants towards better health. Done well, the result should be a democratization of what has historically been a privilege for those that could afford gym memberships or personal trainers.</p><p>Imagine a user with a specific goal \u2013\u00a0looking their best before a reunion, or competing in a race. Using a wearable device and software intelligence, they can now understand how and when they should be exercising, how to adapt sleep patterns to get better results, and how their nutrition habits affect performance. Imagine further an athlete wearing smart clothing that allows coaches to monitor their fatigue levels and muscular exertion. The coach now has real-time data that allows them to modify their training regimens to ensure peak performance when it matters.</p><p>The possibilities are endless and the amount and sophistication of data \u2013\u00a0and the interpretation of that data \u2013 will continue to grow. In this regard, wearables are no different than any other hardware category that rapidly expanded after attaining a smart software layer: networking, the personal computer, and most recently mobile phones.</p>", "title": ["In 2015, Software Eats The Wearable World"], "author": ["Kunal Agarwal", "Elliot Loh"]},

It stands to reason that just as the iPhone and iPad that came before it, the Apple Watch will begin to show up in the enterprise, very likely on the wrists of executives who will want to use it in conjunction with their i-life -and IT will have to figure out how it all comes together.</p><p>Eventually IT will need to develop apps too, just as it did for other mobile platforms and developers will have to learn to deal with the different screen size, says\u00a0Sravish Sridhar, CEO of\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kinvey.com/\">Kinvey</a>, a mobile development platform. Sridhar\u00a0believes it\u2019s going to take a bigger leap than the phones and tablets that came before it.</p><p>\u201cIf businesses want to incorporate wearables like this into their workflows, it\u2019s not just about accompanying a new screen. It\u2019s a fundamentally new user interface and user experience (i.e,. no one is going to expect it to function like a phone/tablet). There are new inputs (force as well as touch), new inter-device communication modes, and new data points that phones have never been able to collect (e.g. heartbeat),\u201d Sridhar wrote in an email.</p><p>These new ways of working\u00a0have the potential at least to\u00a0drive developer creativity, but Sridhar believes it\u2019s going to take some time before they learn to truly take advantage of all the new device has to offer just as it did with earlier devices.</p><p>\u201cI think the first wave of apps we see for the Watch will be really similar to what happened with the desktop-to-mobile shift. Just as, at first, companies tried to simply port desktops apps to mobile, early efforts with the Watch will be attempts at porting mobile functionality to the wrist. And just as the first wave of desktop apps ported to mobile were underwhelming and replaced by mobile-first applications, so will companies quickly realize that it isn\u2019t just a new screen but a brand-new platform,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Speaking at <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2014/\">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> today, Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff told interviewer Michael Arrington he believes the wearables are going to be deeply integrated into the enterprise experience. He didn\u2019t say when, but given <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.techtimes.com/articles/15003/20140905/salesforce-sees-big-growth-in-wearables.htm\">his company has already announced Salesforce Wearables</a>, he sees it as a near-term goal and one he seemed genuinely excited about.</p><p>Benioff could picture for instance, a service technicians wearing Google Glass being connected in real time to the service center. He of course wants a future of business wearables that runs through Salesforce.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/XvaF7eE5mGs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></span></p><p>Whether that happens remains to be seen, but\u00a0as these devices trickle into the enterprise, it makes sense developers will use the older mobile\u00a0paradigms for starters, then they will learn to use the device to access the features to do different things that make sense in the context of how the device works.</p><p>As before, we will very likely hear people dismiss the Apple Watch and similar devices as \u201ctoys,\u201d but I\u2019m willing to bet that these toys could have some serious enterprise utility as creative developers come up with ways to exploit them. When that happens, as always early adopters will have a competitive advantage.</p><p>The wearables are coming. The Apple Watch has a good chance of mainstreaming them. Better get ready.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/iphone2014event\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/apple-2014-09.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>", "title": ["Apple Watch Will Drive Wearables Into The Enterprise"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},

The app can control these boxes via Wi-Fi connections, giving the iPhone software full control over DVR functions including channel changing, smart guide navigation, setting and playing back recordings and more.</p><p>Peel has had success on Android thus far, in part because of manufacturers\u2019 willingness to include IR blasters in their devices, including the HTC One M8 and the Samsung Galaxy S5.

{"date": ["2013-11-25"], "text": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.relayrides.com\">RelayRides</a> is serious about entering the airport car rental market and enabling its users to make their vehicles available to travelers when not in use. It took a big step in that direction over the summer, when it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.techmeme.com/130730/p15#a130730p15\">launched its peer-to-peer rentals at San Francisco International Airport</a>.</p><p>Now RelayRides is solidifying its spot at SFO by striking a deal with the airport to clear up any questions about the legality of its service there. As part of the deal, the company has agreed to pay a fee for customers that are traveling through the airport, and it\u2019s also partnered with a nearby lot and shuttle service to reduce congestion at arrivals and departures drop-off points.</p><p>For RelayRides, making peer-to-peer rentals available at airports is a natural fit, particularly as the company is focusing more heavily on long-term rentals. The company <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/01/relayrides-long-term-rentals/\">ended its hourly rental feature</a> in October, due to lackluster demand in that area, and is betting the future of the business on multiday rentals.</p><p>Travelers figure to be a part of that as well, as it gave users the ability to begin listing their cars at nearby airports in June. But its implementation at SFO is probably the best example of what RelayRides would like to do on a large scale: The company has partnered with a nearby parking lot to house rentals for travelers leaving the Bay Area and making their cars available to renters while they\u2019re gone.</p><p>RelayRides isn\u2019t the only startup seeking to make peer-to-peer car rentals available at airports. FlightCar, which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/04/flightcar-monthly/\">launched earlier this year at SFO</a> and has <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/15/flightcar-5-5m-funding/\">raised $6.1 million</a> from General Catalyst and Softbank Capital (among others) is also working to connect passengers with cheaper car rental prices at the airport. But while FlightCar has resisted working with SFO to date, RelayRides wanted to get ahead of any controversy by striking a deal with the airport.</p><p>There were two main concerns from the airport when it set up shop, according to RelayRides CEO Andre Haddad. The first was that it would contribute back fees to the airport for passengers that used its service, in the same way cabs, black cars, and shuttle buses do. The other concern was around congestion, and how it would reduce bottlenecks at the terminal.</p><p>On the first point, RelayRides is paying a portion of its revenues for travelers who come from SFO back to the airport. And it\u2019s reducing congestion by offering parking at a local lot and sharing shuttles to the airport.</p><p>For RelayRides, the deal will help avoid any run-ins with SFO, which has been trying to crack down on various startups that operate outside the traditional framework that its existing transportation partners follow. For instance, the airport issued <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/04/sfo-hates-ride-sharing/\">cease-and-desist letters to ride-sharing companies</a> like Lyft and SideCar earlier this year because those services fail to pay the typical fees that cabs do when picking up or dropping off passengers.</p><p>More broadly, though, RelayRides is trying to work with local regulators and governments whenever possible, even going so far as to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/15/after-being-hit-with-a-cease-and-desist-car-sharing-startup-relayrides-suspends-rentals-in-new-york/\">suspend service in New York</a> after being <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.techmeme.com/130516/p14#a130516p14\">hit with a cease-and-desist order</a> there. The company, which has raised $30 million from investors that include GM, Shasta Ventures, August Capital, and Google Ventures, hopes that by doing so it can help ensure that peer-to-peer car rentals remain here to stay.</p><p>Photo Credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/93755244@N00/4142552587/\">H\u00e5kan Dahlstr\u00f6m</a> via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://compfight.com\">Compfight</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">cc</a></p>", "title": ["RelayRides Reaches Deal To Make Its Peer-To-Peer Car Rentals Legal At SFO"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

Hopefully this gives future BVP Funded teams some sense of how we evaluate the potential of their products and ideas and ultimately make decisions on what to fund.</p><p>Because I remembered seeing shades of Twitch in Periscope, I decided to start with Twitch, an investment I championed in partnership with my colleague <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/davidcowan\">David Cowan</a>.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1225178\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/twitch-logo.png?w=1024&amp;h=576\" alt=\"twitch-logo\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\"></p><p><strong>The Team: </strong>We liked the team. They were passionate about the business, solid on execution and knew where to focus to build the organization. Emmett Shear was a first-time CEO, but up for the challenge. Although there were gaps in the team, they were off the charts on a number of \u201chard to hire\u201d attributes: passion, product vision and empathy for their users.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224675\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image-11.jpg?w=680&amp;h=618\" alt=\"Image 1[1]\" width=\"680\" height=\"618\"></p><p>With the Amazon acquisition behind us, it\u2019s impressive to look back at the path Twitch travelled. The team killed it: Emmett proved himself to be a terrific CEO, managing the technical complexity of scaling such a large site cost-effectively as well as the business challenges of managing the community, cementing deals with both game publishers and console platforms while building a successful advertising and subscription business. In the process, he hired a strong management team, including a CRO, CFO and General Counsel to help him manage the growth.</p><p>It turns out we were wrong about the need for an experienced ad sales leader. Immediately after we invested, Twitch\u2019s CRO Jonny Simpson-Bint took this on and built one of the best ad sales teams around.</p><p><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Twitch had some of the characteristics of a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bvp.com/Marketplaces\">marketplace</a>, which have inherent network effects, tend to be much stickier and are prone to consistent growth if both sides of the marketplace are working properly.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224676\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image-21.jpg?w=680&amp;h=185\" alt=\"Image 2[1]\" width=\"680\" height=\"185\"></p><p><strong>The Idea And Market Size:</strong> As we described it to the firm: \u201cTwitch is based on the non-intuitive idea that watching other people play video games is entertaining.\u201d Clearly, Twitch targeted a very specific audience. Maybe we weren\u2019t their target demographic, but their growth was undeniable. We knew they were on to something and conversations with enthusiastic Twitch partners confirmed that.</p><p>We did have a long existential debate internally about whether the overall market size was big enough \u2014 and believed this to be the key risk to the investment \u2014 but, unfortunately, there weren\u2019t many definitive data points we could point to that informed the debate.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224678\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image-31.jpg?w=473&amp;h=680\" alt=\"Image 3[1]\" width=\"473\" height=\"680\"></p><p>In drawing parallels between Twitch and the viral growth of online poker and e-sports in Asia, we convinced ourselves video games could not only become a spectator sport, but that the market size was large enough for Twitch to become a massive site, which is necessary to have any sort of effective advertising business.</p><p>It also felt like a pre-existing behavior, as even before the Internet, it\u2019s pretty natural to find a group of friends watching each other play a particularly engaging console game live in the living room. So why wouldn\u2019t this experience eventually migrate online?</p><p>Twitch\u2019s metrics pretty much spoke for themselves:</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224681\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image-42.jpg?w=680&amp;h=439\" alt=\"Image 4[2]\" width=\"680\" height=\"439\"></p><p><strong>Twitch\u2019s Advertising Monetization Efforts: </strong>When we first invested, Twitch was still in the nascent stages of figuring out its media sales strategy, having tried remnant optimization, rep firms and even direct sales. They were working with one specific partner to bundle Twitch\u2019s inventory with theirs in order to garner premium CPMs:</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224683\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image-52.jpg?w=680&amp;h=296\" alt=\"Image 5[2]\" width=\"680\" height=\"296\"></p><p>This turned out to be wrong; having a partner rep their inventory actually degraded\u00a0\u2014 not improved \u2014 its quality. The better strategy was to sell Twitch on its own. Fortunately, Twitch was able to amicably end the relationship and build their own sales team. By that point, they had grown enough that Twitch was by itself a premium site and didn\u2019t need the help.</p><p><strong>Financing Needs: </strong>Our memo is completely silent on this topic. Given that the team had operated JustinTV profitably for many years, I think we believed they would be able to scale the infrastructure needed to support Twitch in a capital-efficient way.</p><p>It turned out that as traffic continued to ramp faster than expected (and the partner-driven advertising efforts underperformed), we needed additional capital to continue scaling while taking advertising in-house. As a result, we raised a Series C one year later. We try to forecast things like future financing needs, so this was a miss on our part.</p><p><strong>Competition For Broadcasters:</strong> While we talked a lot about competitive threats from other players like own3d (now defunct) and YouTube, we missed the key issue here:\u00a0attempts to poach popular streamers would become a regular (and costly) occurrence. The team did a great job fighting and winning this battle through building the better product and attracting the biggest audience for live game viewing, but it was a constant distraction and more costly than we realized.</p><p><strong>Mobile:</strong> The only mention of the word mobile in reference to Twitch is in this section:</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224685\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image-63.jpg?w=680&amp;h=103\" alt=\"Image 6[3]\" width=\"680\" height=\"103\"></p><p>This shows you how much the world has changed over the past three years (or how asleep I was back in 2012). We just didn\u2019t focus our diligence on Twitch\u2019s plans for mobile. Luckily, the Twitch team was more on top of it than we were and built a highly popular mobile app for viewing (which is consistently ranked in the top 25 in the entertainment category on iOS today) and several SDK-based mobile integrations for broadcasting.</p><p>Would Twitch be big? It was too early to tell, but we were optimistic. The niche was unusual, but we couldn\u2019t deny the traction and potential. For a young company, Twitch exhibited some powerful early indicators of success: a meaningful and growing customer base, a powerful network effect and very strong engagement. We wanted to invest.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224690\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image-72.jpg?w=680&amp;h=197\" alt=\"Image 7[2]\" width=\"680\" height=\"197\"></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>To quote our first investment recommendation, we considered Periscope \u201can audacious concept\u201d\u2026. whose time may have come. Recognizing elements of JustinTV (the failed predecessor that spawned Twitch), we felt that now both the technology and the market were ripe for Periscope.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224691\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image-8.jpg?w=680&amp;h=236\" alt=\"Image 8\" width=\"680\" height=\"236\"></p><p><strong>The Team:</strong> As with Twitch, we respected and liked the founders of Periscope. Both teams were scrappy and focused on executing.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224692\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image-9.jpg?w=680&amp;h=225\" alt=\"Image 9\" width=\"680\" height=\"225\"></p><p>As with Emmett at Twitch, Kayvon, Joe and the team turned out to have very prescient vision for future forms of online social interaction and be strong product designers and scrappy operators. I didn\u2019t have as much time to observe their execution, but from the tremendous growth in Periscope (10 million registered users and 40 years of video watched per day, according to a Q&amp;A Periscope stream that Kayvon held), they\u2019ve clearly managed the dual challenges of generating awareness and scaling the technical infrastructure required to support a massive user load.</p><p><strong>Total Addressable Market:</strong> Periscope had broad appeal. Sure, it was audacious, but given the proliferation of social media access on smartphones, it seemed conceivable. And in this case, there wasn\u2019t as big a concern about only appealing to one particular type of user. As Facebook and Twitter have shown, the inclination to share\u00a0\u2014 either broadly or with a limited set of friends\u00a0\u2014 is pretty ubiquitous if given the right environment and context.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224693\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image-10.jpg?w=680&amp;h=386\" alt=\"Image 10\" width=\"680\" height=\"386\"></p><p>When investing in Periscope\u2019s seed round, I expected them to launch the app, take some time to iterate to get to a compelling product and eventually refine their approach to distribution over the following year. I was surprised (and amazed) by how quickly all of this happened.</p><p>Within five months of our investment, they were on the radar screen of large Internet companies like Twitter, and had nailed the interaction and distribution model so cleverly that Twitter was interested in an acquisition even before they had launched a product. Had I known this, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have waited to try to lead the Series A!</p><p>Again this was a very early investment \u2014 much earlier than in the case of Twitch \u2014 but the idea and founding team were so compelling that we invested as much as the team would let us. In fact, when I first circulated this investment memo, my colleagues at BVP told me that the idea and timing were so compelling and the team so well-suited to building a great product that I should ask Kayvon to let us invest more. Fortunately, he relented and I was able to more than double our investment.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1224695\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image-111.jpg?w=680&amp;h=123\" alt=\"Image 11\" width=\"680\" height=\"123\"></p><p>In reviewing these memos, some of the conclusions are obvious. The team is critical to ultimate success. The timing must be right (e.g., JustinTV wasn\u2019t able to capture the broader Periscope opportunity back in 2007; there weren\u2019t ubiquitous smartphones back then). Having a revenue model that will ultimately fund the operation of the business shouldn\u2019t be an afterthought. But some of the interesting pieces lie in the nuances and patterns.</p><p>Both teams thought about the appeal and incentives for all of the various constituents\u00a0\u2014 broadcasters, viewers and game developers/publishers in the case of Twitch, and broadcasters and viewers in Periscope. They thought up front about incentives and rewards (social, financial and otherwise) for being on the platform and how those mechanics differed as the products grew up and the online behavior became more mainstream.</p><p>Both teams also thought about the fundamental mechanics of social interactions in the offline world\u00a0\u2014 and how best to bring those into new media in the most natural way possible. This didn\u2019t necessarily mean replicating existing behaviors without any behavior change, as the Internet and mobile affords an opportunity to re-invent and reshape cultural norms.</p><p>But each successful social product has to tap into an innate desire to be social in the first place\u00a0\u2014 an obvious statement in hindsight, but not always considered up front. And finally, both teams had tried it before and persisted \u2014 with the result being that they were driven to have a bigger impact this time around.</p>", "title": ["A Look At The Internal Memos Of Twitch And Periscope"], "author": ["Ethan Kurzweil"]},

It truly is to enable people to lead healthier lifestyles,\u201d added Callaghan.</p><p>He\u00a0was speaking during a fireside chat with TC\u2019s John Biggs and Fitbit CEO and co-founder James Park. True Ventures\u00a0was an early Fitbit investor, participating in Fitbit\u2019s\u00a0first external funding round back in 2008 \u2014 and cashing out handsomely this June when the company\u00a0went public.</p><p>Fitbit\u2019s journey is the stuff that entrepreneur\u00a0dreams are made on.\u00a0From its software-focused founders\u2019 original decision to step off piste to build\u00a0hardware after being\u00a0inspired by the\u00a0Nintendo Wii \u2014 \u201cwe didn\u2019t know anything about hardware at the time\u2026 in hindsight it was probably something completely dumb for us to do,\u201d said Park \u2014 to\u00a0pitching their first prototype at TC 50 back in 2008, when they demoed\u00a0a circuit board stuck inside a glued together DIY balsa wood case. To the big one: this <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/18/fitbit-spikes-more-than-50-in-ipo-debut/\">year\u2019s IPO</a>, which pulled\u00a0some $358 million into the company\u2019s coffers.</p><p>These days, of course,\u00a0the tech space is lousy with all sorts of wearables. And very large players like Apple\u00a0have their own hyper-polished bets. But Fitbit\u2019s Park is not concerned about all this competition \u2014 even that oh-so-shiny wristwear being designed in Cupertino.</p><p>\u201cI think observers and press actually like to view almost every market as some kind of life and death battle \u2014 winner takes all. But the health and fitness category is a pretty large and diverse opportunity,\u201d he argued. \u201cConsumers spend over $200 billion on health and fitness products and services. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of different companies that win in different bits of this market.</p><p>\u201cFor us and Apple, we don\u2019t see ourselves as directly competitive today. And the numbers show it. Year over year our revenue tripled towards $400 million last quarter. The guidance that we gave analysts for\u00a0our last earnings call was $1.7 billion in revenue this year, so we\u2019re doing incredibly well. And I think consumers like the fact that we\u2019re really focused on the category.\u201d</p><p>One specific characteristic\u00a0of\u00a0the U.S. market that\u2019s helping driving coins towards\u00a0Fitbit\u2019s coffers\u00a0is high health insurance costs.\u00a0\u201cIt was a big win for us,\u201d noted\u00a0Park, referring to a recent deal with\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/sep/21/target-to-offer-fitbit-devices-to-335-0/\">retailer Target</a>\u00a0which will offer Fitbits to its 335,000 employees. \u201cCorporate wellness is a big thing. In the U.S. in particular health insurance costs is a big thing.\u00a0Companies are looking for any way \u2014 piece of technology \u2014 to help their employees get healthier.\u201d</p><p>In terms of the specifics of Fitbit standing out in a sweaty crowd, Park emphasized the variety in its\u00a0product portfolio as one part of its\u00a0strategy, along with a focus on core consumer\u00a0issues\u00a0like battery life.\u00a0\u201cPeople trust our products,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a broad range of products at different price-points, different styles, cross platform compatibility, we have a lot of focus on battery life which also matters in this category. So there\u2019s a lot of different ways we try to cater to consumer needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think what people overlook too is the power of the software and the social network that\u2019s behind Fitbit,\u201d added\u00a0Callaghan, discussing the importance of branding and ecosystem\u00a0in the fitness\u00a0category. \u201cFitbit\u2019s probably one of the largest fitness-focused social networks in the world.\u00a0In fitness I\u2019ve been an investor in the fitness category for a very long time \u2014 it\u2019s very, very challenging to have a brand that is both high performance for athletes in the performance activity and also really approachable to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFitbit\u2019s done a remarkable job opening up this category to this enormous chunk of the market. Both at the high end but also with different form factors and price points.\u00a0Not many companies in history have done that. Nike is one example. So it\u2019s very challenging to do that in this category. I think it\u2019s a great testament to their brand and their vision,\u201d he added.</p><p>So what should budding hardware entrepreneurs be thinking as they dream about building the next Fitbit? \u201cHave a mission, really, really believe and do something very, very challenging,\u201d said\u00a0Callaghan. \u201cI always say hardware is the double black diamond of startups. It\u2019s not the easy path. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart. Doing something round the edge of a category, not interesting at all. Reinvent a category.

JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js and ASP.NET 5 developers will also get a set of additional tools.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1150779\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/2i8a9076.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" alt=\"2I8A9076\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><p>The editor features all of the standard tools you would expect from a modern code editor, including syntax highlighting, customizable keyboard bindings, bracket matching and snippets.

These include the Roslyn project, for example, Microsoft\u2019s .NET compiler platform and Microsoft says the language services it built for Visual Studio Code will be available in other editors as well, including Sublime Text, Vi and Atom.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1150721\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/visual_studio_code_2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=481\" alt=\"visual_studio_code_2\" width=\"1024\" height=\"481\"></p><p>Some of these language features are also available to other editors. Not too long ago, Microsoft launched a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin\">TypeScript plug-in</a> for Sublime Text, for example, and Somasegar tells me the company is committed to launching similar projects in the future (it\u2019s all about meeting developers where they are, after all).</p><p>Today\u2019s announcement will surely come as a surprise to many. It does, however, fit in well with the direction the company\u2019s developer group has been on for quite a while now, be that the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/12/microsoft-takes-net-open-source-and-cross-platform/\">open sourcing of .NET Core</a> (and taking that platform cross-platform) or the launch of the free <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/12/microsoft-makes-visual-studio-free-for-small-teams/\">Visual Studio Community</a> edition.</p><p>Only a few years ago, today\u2019s announcement would have come as a shock.

Even today, it\u2019s still an invite-only service (but\u00a0invites are pretty easy to come by these days). Until now, however, it wasn\u2019t possible to use Inbox with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/\">Google Apps for Work</a> accounts. That\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://googleforwork.blogspot.com/2015/02/lets-build-new-work-inbox-together.html\">changing today</a>. Google has\u00a0now launched an invite process that allows Google Apps for Work admins to request access to the service.</p><p>Once again, Google is going with a very slow rollout. This is going to be an early adopter program and company admins that already use Google Apps for Work will have\u00a0to email Google to request an invite (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:inboxforwork@google.com\">inboxforwork@google.com</a>). Once they get that \u2014 and have Inbox enabled for their companies \u2014 their users will be able to use it. Google will send out the first invites next month.</p><p>Only admins will be able to ask for\u00a0invites, by the way, so make sure you do something nice for your friendly neighborhood sysadmin <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Administrator_Appreciation_Day\">on July 31st</a>.</p><p>Google says the companies that should consider signing up for the early adopter program are those that want to use Inbox as their primary email service, whose employees are heavy mobile email users and those that want to partner with Google on user studies to learn more about how employees use the service.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1122718\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/inbox-by-gmail-the-inbox-that-works-for-you.png?w=1024&amp;h=405\" alt=\"Inbox by Gmail - the inbox that works for you\" width=\"1024\" height=\"405\"></p><p>The goal of Inbox, as Google\u2019s Alex Gawley told me last week, has\u00a0always been to rethink how people get things done. Email usage, after all, has changed a lot\u00a0since its early days, yet most email clients haven\u2019t adapted to these new realities yet. Google itself has been using Inbox for Work internally for many months now and Gawley tells me that the team has learned quite a bit from this.</p><p><img class=\"  wp-image-1122989 alignright\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/inbox3.gif?w=330&amp;h=603\" alt=\"Inbox3\" width=\"330\" height=\"603\">The Inbox for Work experience will be virtually indistinguishable from the consumer experience. Gawley acknowledged that they way\u00a0people\u00a0use their work email is different from how they handle their personal inbox.</p><p>Chances are\u00a0that\u00a0Inbox for Work users won\u2019t use the Purchase and Social bundles (Inbox\u2019s version of folders) quite as often as regular Gmail users. Instead,\u00a0Gawley said, Google Apps users tend to rely on their priority inbox more than others, for example. He also noted\u00a0that while users can always create their own filters, Google wants to build a solution that gives all users a great out-of-the-box experience. To do this, Google is thinking about how\u00a0to better approach automatic email categorization in the work context, for example.</p><p>While it probably takes a bit of manual setup to make bundles work well in a work environment, Inbox\u2019s snooze and reminder features actually work really well out of the box, no matter your use case.</p><p>\u201cWe want to learn from our users,\u201d Gawley\u00a0stressed, \u201cOur goal is to work in partnership with people on the product.

The same goes for the\u00a0browser or mobile operating system.</p><p>Outdated browsers and operating systems are often an easy attack zone for hackers. In fact, Duo claims its research has found that 60 percent\u00a0of Macs and 80\u00a0percent of\u00a0Windows machines are running old versions of the OS, which could leave these machines\u00a0vulnerable to a number of attacks.</p><p>Part of the problem is that today, companies don\u2019t have the same level of control over their environment\u00a0they once did when they issued the computers\u00a0and phones. People are increasingly bringing their own machines\u00a0including tablets and laptops into the workplace and logging onto the company network from inside and outside the company.\u00a0Today\u2019s\u00a0announced capability gives IT an element of control by letting them see vulnerabilities\u00a0and\u00a0preventing devices that are potentially dangerous from accessing the network.</p><p>Duo has been around since 2010 providing an easy way for individuals to protect their apps. Using a simple approve or deny second factor. In other words, you sign in and then simply click Approve on the next screen to continue. The security comes into play when you see one of those second screens and you didn\u2019t log in, signaling that someone has compromised your logon credentials and giving you the ability to block them. It also signals you that it\u2019s time to change your\u00a0user name and password.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/14/duo-security-30m-redpoint/\">Duo raised $30 million last April</a> bringing their total to $49 million across four rounds, according to Crunchbase.

Other times, you may need to reach a group member with a quick question, but hadn\u2019t bothered to get their contact information just yet.</p><p>In the past, Meetup members \u2013 and I speak from personal experience here \u2013 had no choice but to leave comments on group message boards with your cell phone number in order\u00a0to share your contact information with the group when you weren\u2019t face-to-face with them.</p><p>The new Messages feature will offer a safer alternative \u2013 group members can now reach out directly to one another both on the web and in the app, in order to continue getting to know each other, plan future events, share information, or just chat.</p><p>All your Messages can be seen in the new Messages tab in the mobile app, and you\u2019ll also receive push notifications when new messages arrive.</p><p>However, the feature is fairly bare bones \u2013 there isn\u2019t a way to share media like stickers, photos or videos in the Messages section at this time, which would be a good way to kick off a conversation with a new friend (e.g. \u201cHere\u2019s that picture you wanted!\u201d). Hopefully, the company will add more functionality to Messages over time.</p><p>This\u00a0feature has been live for a few days now, but it\u2019s one of many user experience enhancements <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meetup\">Meetup</a> has been rolling out over the past few weeks, it should be noted. There have also been upgrades to some of the icons in the app, including Notifications, and the company also launched its own take on crowdfunding with a\u00a0\u201cContributions\u201d feature.

TechCrunch has learned that Snapchat has just signed the Global Director of Facebook\u2019s Preferred Marketing Developer program <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=3634555\">Mike Randall</a> as its new\u00a0VP Of Business And Marketing Partnerships.</p><p>Following this weekend\u2019s highly successful launch of Snapchat\u2019s new <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/21/snapchat-our-story/\">collaborative event livestream feature Our Story</a> at the Electric Daisy Carnival music festival, Randall may have plenty of opportunities for Snapchat to finally start monetizing by working with other big events and brands.</p><p>Randall started at Snapchat this month after four years at Facebook. As global director of the PMD program, he worked with Facebook\u2019s biggest developer partners to help brands run ads, publish content through Pages, build apps, and analyze the results. Before that he spent three years as the Western region\u2019s VP of Marketing Solutions.</p><p>This experience will give him plenty of insight into how to help brands creatively embrace social media while raking in cash for his parent company.</p><p>Snapchat has plenty of directions it could go, like sponsored snaps sent directly to users or promoted accounts whose Stories they could follow. But a year ago, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel told TechCrunch\u2019s\u00a0Jordan Crook that \u201c<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/24/snapchats-first-monetization-move-will-be-in-app-purchases/\">in-app transactions will come first</a>.

After hitting up EDC in-person and watching it on Snapchat, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/21/snapchat-our-story/\">I called Our Story a genius, collaborative reinvention of the live stream</a> that was a vivid, accurate portrayal of what it felt like to be there.</p><p>When Snapchatters went to submit their photos and videos from EDC, they may have stumbled upon something special. Along with options to overlay the time, temperature, or Instagram-esque tints, they could stick colorful EDC filters over their Snaps that featured the EDC logo and images like \u201cParty Up,\u201d seen here.</p><p>Snapchat might one day sell these kinds of filters to let people \u201cpay for a more unique experience\u201d as Spiegel said. Behind the scenes, big music festivals and sporting events might pay Snapchat to make them an Our Story and promote it to users. And since an Our Story can be hundreds of clips long, it might be possible to slip in some branded snaps.</p><p>Figuring out which of these and other opportunities will resonate with brands without alienating users will be Randall\u2019s responsibility. Luckily he\u2019ll have help from another former Facebooker, Snapchat COO Emily White, who was formerly Instagram\u2019s director of business operations.

The latest company to come under fire from regulators is peer-to-peer car-sharing startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://relayrides.com\">RelayRides</a>, which received a cease-and-desist notice from New York State\u2019s Department of Financial Services (DFS).</p><p>The DFS has charged RelayRides with \u201cfalse advertising and violations of insurance law,\u201d which it says could put the public at risk. Along with the cease and desist, the department has issued a \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumer/relay_rides_consumer_alert.htm\">scam alert</a>\u201d due to intricacies in New York insurance law that could leave those who use car-sharing services like RelayRides liable in the case of an accident.</p><p>In short, the DFS warns that the insurance from RelayRides\u2019 provider Hudson Insurance Company may not cover damages that occur while a car is being rented through the service. Furthermore, participating in these types of car-sharing programs could be a violation of their existing policies and could result in the cancellation of their insurance.</p><p>As a result, RelayRides has agreed to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://relayrides.com/blog/2013/05/suspending-new-rentals-in-ny/\">suspend new rentals in the state</a> while it tries to work with the department on the issue. In a blog post, CEO Andre Haddad said the company would honor existing reservations in the meantime.</p><p>The suspension of service was announced one day after the startup <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/14/relayrides-acquires-wheelz/\">acquired San Francisco-based competitor Wheelz</a>.

The cease-and-desist against the car-sharing startup comes at the same time that ride-sharing startup SideCar is coming under regulatory scrutiny from local officials in Austin, Philadelphia and New York City.

Well, apparently it wasn\u2019t alone, as other new transportation startups had also received the same notice last month.</p><p>SideCar, for instance, confirmed that it received a cease-and-desist letter in early March. Zimride\u2019s Lyft hasn\u2019t responded to our inquiries, but we\u2019ve heard that it too was one of the companies hit with a C&amp;D notice. InstantCab, which operates a hybrid service with both community and taxi drivers, was actually the last of the companies to be served with a notice by SFO. And that notice applied to its community drivers only, not the taxi e-hail side of its business.</p><p>The letters served to remind companies like Lyft and SideCar that the site is operated by the City and County of San Francisco and the Airport Commission, and also as a reminder that they didn\u2019t have permits to operate on SFO premises. Without a permit, the notices say that continued operation of community driver services at SFO will be considered \u201can unlawful trespass.\u201d In particular, the notice says those services are violating a couple of airport rules and regulations, including this one:</p><p>Like every other airport in the world, SFO allows regulated taxi services to pick up and drop off passengers on the premises. Black car and limo services have been driving passengers to and from SFO for decades. And over the past few years, Uber has even provided a transportation alternative to those flying in and out of the airport \u2014 although Uber drivers are mostly indistinguishable from limo services, in part because the company partners with them for its UberBLACK and UberSUV service.</p><p>The key distinguishing feature of the services hit by cease-and-desist letters by SFO seems to be that they employ community drivers who are not licensed by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency or the California Public Utilities Commission.</p><p>In that respect, SFO isn\u2019t the first to try to outlaw these services. Lyft and SideCar (along with Uber and Tickengo) had all <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/08/cpuc-ride-sharing-c-and-d/\">received C&amp;D notices from the CPUC</a> last year before the agency backtracked and began examining the possibility of <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/20/cpuc-lyft-sidecar/\">creating a new regulatory framework for ride-sharing services</a>. And SideCar has received some pushback from local regulators in markets, such as Philadelphia and Austin, cities it recently expanded into.</p><p>The wild card here is Uber, which to our knowledge hasn\u2019t yet received notice from SFO. While it\u2019s quietly served the airport\u2019s passengers since launching in San Francisco years ago, it recently joined the ride-sharing brigade by contracting community drivers for its lower-priced UBERx service.</p><p>Photo Credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/93755244@N00/4142552587/\">H\u00e5kan Dahlstr\u00f6m</a> via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://compfight.com\">Compfight</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">cc</a></p>", "title": ["SFO Serves Cease-And-Desist Letters To Keep Ride-Sharing Companies From Operating At The Airport"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

The startup,\u00a0which\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/15/flightcar/\">launched its service at San Francisco International Airport</a>\u00a0just a few months ago, is hoping to open for business in a number of other markets over the course of the rest of the year.\u00a0To do that, it has raised a $5.5 million Series A round, with a number of high-profile investors, including General Catalyst, Softbank Capital, Airbnb founder and CEO Brian Chesky, as well as Ryan Seacrest\u2019s Seacrest Global Group.</p><p>Other investors in the round include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Posterous founder Garry Tan, Auctomatic founder Harj Taggar, Justin.TV founder Emmett Shear, former Expedia CEO Erik Blachford, First Round Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. The new funding comes on top of $590,000 in seed funding from Y Combinator and SV Angel that it had received prior to its initial launch.</p><p>FlightCar\u2019s service works like this: Travelers drop their vehicles off at one of the FlightCar lots at an airport where they are available. Incoming visitors can then rent these vehicles at lower rates than they would find at airport rental chains. If a car is rented, the vehicle\u2019s owner is compensated with gas cards equal to up to $10 for each day a car is rented. If not, the vehicle\u2019s owner gets free parking, which by itself could save them up to $18 a day in long-term parking.</p><p>Cars must have been made by 1999 and have fewer than 150,000 miles to be listed. But FlightCar provides a free wash for all cars that are listed on its site. For travelers, it also provides a valet service to and from the airport for when cars are picked up or dropped off. Most importantly, the service is backed by a $1 million insurance policy for both owners and renters.</p><p>According to FlightCar co-founder Shri Ganeshram, the new funding will be used to hire some new engineering and design talent, and to speed up launching its service in new markets. Next up will likely be Boston, as Ganeshram is relocating to the Cambridge area, where he hopes to recruit FlightCar\u2019s new employees.</p><p>The founding team behind FlightCar, which also includes Rujul Zaparde and Kevin Petrovic, is still young. The three were just 18 years old when the company was founded*, and so they believe they will have better luck recruiting engineering talent that\u2019s closer to their age, straight out of MIT, than to compete for new employees in Silicon Valley. In addition to SFO and Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport, Ganeshram says the team hopes to have operations at two or three other airports by the end of the year.</p><p>With its list of investors, it should be well positioned to tackle the problems that come with running a peer-to-peer business in the travel space. After all, Chesky, Ohanian, and Blachford, as well as some others, should all be able to give some insight into how to connect with consumers as well as improving the quality service of a peer-to-peer business model.</p><p>==<br>\n* Petrovic\u2019s 19th birthday is today.

And then there\u2019s the elaborate list of steps required to get each component working properly (don\u2019t forget to set the tuner to HDMI2 before firing up the Blu-Ray!)  The associated headaches have spawned an entire industry of super-remotes like Logitech\u2019s Harmony devices. But what about the mobile powerhouses we\u2019ve already dropped hundreds of dollars on \u2014 shouldn\u2019t our smart phones be able to control our home entertainment systems?</p><p>That\u2019s the promise of <a href=\"http://www.peel.com/\">Peel</a>, a Santa Clara-based startup that is looking to help you take control over your entertainment system using your iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, or (soon) Android device. The company has just launched its first product \u2014 the <a href=\"http://www.peel.com/peel-fruit.php\">Peel fruit</a> \u2014\u00a0 that retails online and in the Apple store for $99. Check out the videos below for an interview with the startup\u2019s founders.</p><p>The plastic \u2018fruit\u2019 essentially acts as a middleman between your phone/tablet and your television components \u2014 Peel uses a Wifi connection to relay commands from your phone to the \u2018fruit\u2019, which then blasts the appropriate infrared signals to all of your hardware devices.  You control everything \u2014 be it a channel change, or swapping between different content sources \u2014\u00a0using a free Peel application for your phone. The application includes a visual guide of the shows that are available (you see thumbnails with each show\u2019s logo), and you can customize the app so that it only recommends shows you\u2019re interested in.<br><img class=\"shot2\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/peelfruit.png\" alt=\"\"><br>\nBecause of the way Peel works you\u2019ll need to position the fruit device in a place where it can \u2018see\u2019 all of your components, which means you\u2019ll have to place it several feet in front of your TV set (and possibly in plain view). It\u2019s not exactly inconspicuous, but it could probably pass as some sort of tribal maraca.</p><p>As with similar universal remotes, setup isn\u2019t painless (you can watch a demo of the process in the video below). After firing up the app and connecting the device you\u2019ll be walked through a wizard designed to automatically figure out the remote codes for all of your components. But there\u2019s some trial-and-error involved, and if you have numerous components, the process will likely take at least ten minutes. That said, there really isn\u2019t a whole lot Peel could do to make it easier.</p><p>Peel has promise, but the mobile application itself is still pretty early. It currently allows you to browse your shows using a slick, visual interface that lets you flick between show listings on your phone or iPad, but only when you\u2019re watching live cable \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have deep integration with your DVR or media streaming devices. It <em>can</em> still control these components, but it switches to a generic browsing mode that relies on gestures: instead of showing thumbnails of available content,\u00a0you essentially navigate through menus the way you would using the arrow buttons on your remote.</p><p>However, Peel has some deals in the works that will improve the situation for some users. It has signed a partnership with TiVo that will allow the app to visually navigate through shows you\u2019ve recorded to your DVR, and it plans to launch Netflix integration in Q3 2011.</p><p>The application will also gradually add more social features, like the ability to tell friends what you\u2019re currently watching. Here, it will face plenty of competition: <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/31/intonow/\">IntoNow</a>, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/28/yap-tv-turns-your-ipad-into-the-perfect-tv-watching-companion/\">yap.TV</a>, Comcast\u2019s <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/11/comcast%E2%80%99s-social-video-discovery-engine-tunerfish-gets-a-ui-makeover-releases-new-version-of-iphone-app/\">Tunerfish</a> and others are all trying to add a social layer to the TV experience.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/peelapp.png\" alt=\"\"><br>\n</p>", "title": ["Peel: A Bridge Between Your iPhone And Home Entertainment System (Video)"], "author": ["Jason Kincaid"]},

Currently, gadgets like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.automatic.com/\">Automatic</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moj.io/\">Mojio</a> and others can already pull data from the car\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://readwrite.com/2014/03/05/smart-cars-onboard-diagnostics-automatic-mojio-dash-truvulo\">OBD port</a>\u00a0and Marchwicki acknowledged that there is definitely an overlap between the kind of sensor data these tools and AppLink now offer developers. He argues, though, that AppLink\u2019s data set can give developers information like rain sensor data and location information that isn\u2019t accessible through the OBD port (though Mojio has a built-in GPS receiver, for example).</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve taken what we think is the most useful information that can be easily translated into user-actionable data by developers,\u201d Marchwicki said. He believes this opens up lots of opportunities for crowdsourced information, for example (when your wipers are on, after all, that\u2019s probably a good indication that it\u2019s raining in your current location).</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1199394\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/ford-1-9.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=681\" alt=\"ford-1-9\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\"></p><p>Ford says that more than 13,000 developers have registered for its developer program since it rolled out in 2013 and more than 24,000 software development kits have been downloaded. Sadly, that doesn\u2019t mean that there are now thousands of compatible apps. Instead, there are only 90. Any way you look at it, that\u2019s a massive gap.</p><p>Marchwicki acknowledged as much. \u201cThere is a clear gap between exploring and bringing it into the car,\u201d he said and noted that the degree of testing and quality assurance necessary to allow apps in the car is one of the main reasons for the small number of apps available right now. \u201cI don\u2019t think developers who are developing for the automotive space are aware of our quality requirements.\u201d</p><p>To rectify this, the company plans to ensure that developers have\u00a0more realistic expectations when they develop for the car\u00a0and understand that they have to make sure they exactly follow\u00a0Ford\u2019s quality guidelines. In addition, Marchwicki\u2019s team is also looking at releasing a software emulator so developers can test their apps more easily.</p><p>Because it\u2019s so hard to get apps into the car, Ford runs the risk that developers will simply develop for Android Auto and Apple\u2019s CarPlay platform instead \u2014 both of which Ford says it will support in the future.</p><p>To counter this, Ford has recently open-sourced the AppLink platform and some other manufacturers, including Toyota, are now looking at support it. That would give developers a\u00a0larger potential install base, but I think what developers really want is an easy way to integrate their apps\u00a0with the car.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1199372\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/ford-1-5.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680\" alt=\"ford-1-5\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\"></p>", "title": ["Ford Brings In-Vehicle Notifications And Sensor Access To Its Sync AppLink Developer Platform"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},
{"date": ["2015-02-23"], "text": "<p>Late last week, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/19/youtube-kids/\">news leaked</a> that YouTube was poised to release a new, kid-friendly version of its YouTube service for mobile devices. Today, much to the delight of families everywhere, that app has now arrived, complete with a simplified design, a curated selection of kid-safe content, parental controls, and more. Google says the app will be made available to families on both Android and iOS devices, contrary to earlier reports that YouTube Kids would be Android-first.</p><p>There\u2019s been a need for an app like this for some time \u2013 in fact, parents\u2019 desires for a safer video service for their children even led a number of startups to jump in and fill the void, as YouTube itself was dropping the ball. At TechCrunch, we had covered several of these YouTube alternatives for kids in the past, including apps like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/18/totlol-delivers-a-kid-safe-alternative-to-youtube-on-web-mobile/\">Happly</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jitterbug.tv/\">Jitterbug.tv</a>, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/25/playkids-tv/\">PlayKids TV</a>, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/21/hot-or-not-founder-returns-with-cakey-a-youtube-app-for-kids/\">Cakey</a>, and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/18/totlol-delivers-a-kid-safe-alternative-to-youtube-on-web-mobile/\">Totlol</a>\u00a0(now <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2009/06/05/totlol-developer-forced-to-shut-down-kids-video-service/\">defunct</a>), for example.</p><p>Elsewhere, the iTunes and Google Play Store were filled with apps from other developers who launched\u00a0their own kid-safe video apps built on top of YouTube, like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kid-safe-tube-tv-safe-videos/id531168856?mt=8\">Kid-safe Tube TV</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appsrental.kidsvideoplayer&amp;hl=en\">Kids Video Player for YouTube</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/youtube-videos-for-kids/id395463337?mt=8\">YouTube Videos for Kids</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/itubelist-youtube-playlist/id438991471?mt=8\">Playlist for YouTube</a>, and several more. Many of these apps, however, were of poor quality or suffered from bad design. And now that YouTube Kids is officially available, it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll lose a good\u00a0portion of whatever audience they had built up over years past.</p><p><img class=\"  wp-image-498061 alignright\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/kids-on-tablets.jpg?w=433&amp;h=325\" alt=\"kids on tablets\" width=\"433\" height=\"325\"></p><p>It\u2019s sort of surprising that it took YouTube so long to address this problem \u2013 there are so many children using tablets and parents\u2019 smartphones to browse videos, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2013/05/23/parenting-tip-how-to-control-what-your-child-watches-on-youtube/\">the parental controls YouTube previously offered were so difficult to use</a>\u00a0that most parents didn\u2019t even bother \u2013 if they knew that such an option even existed, which many did not. The problem was crying out for a dedicated application, and that\u2019s what YouTube has today delivered.</p><p>According to\u00a0Shimrit Ben-Yair, Group Product Manager at YouTube Kids, the new app has been in development over the past year, and follows\u00a0200% year-over-year growth in the family entertainment sector on YouTube, she says.</p><p>While the company declined to share how many videos were available in the app at launch, Ben-Yair would say that there are \u201cthousands\u201d of channels on YouTube Kids.</p><p>These channels include a mix between content from well-known children\u2019s entertainment brands like\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DreamworksAnimation\">DreamWorks TV</a>,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JimHensonFamilyTV\">Jim Henson TV</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/MotherGooseClub\">Mother Goose Club</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TalkingFriends\">Talking Tom and Friends</a>,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXVCgDuD_QCkI7gTKU7-tpg\">National Geographic Kids</a>,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDuOVpeQ-BM\">Reading Rainbow</a>,\u00a0and\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBPcrh2R_AQ&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Thomas the Tank Engine</a>, for example, and other shows from YouTubers like\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/scishow\">Vlogbrothers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/stampylonghead\">Stampylonghead</a>.</p><p>The content in the app is first algorithmically filtered for its child-friendliness, Ben-Yair explains. Then YouTube takes a second step towards curation, using a team who\u00a0manually samples the videos for quality control. This two-step process means there may be a slight delay between when content appears on YouTube initially and when it becomes available in the app, she says. But new content is added all the time, much like on YouTube itself.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1122906\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/screenshot_2015-02-23-10-57-49.png?w=680&amp;h=383\" alt=\"Screenshot_2015-02-23-10-57-49\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\"></p><p>For end users, the\u00a0first thing you\u2019ll notice after launching the new application is that YouTube Kids features a completely different design from the regular YouTube application. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/youtube-kids.html\">Google says</a> that the app includes a \u201cbrighter and bigger interface\u201d that\u2019s\u00a0meant to work better for \u201csmall thumbs and pudgy fingers.\u201d That is, the app has big buttons kids tap on to reach dedicated sections in the app, including \u201cShows,\u201d \u201cMusic,\u201d \u201cLearning,\u201d and \u201cExplore,\u201d as indicated by icons of a play button, radio, lightbulb and binoculars, respectively.</p><p>It\u2019s possible that younger kids won\u2019t relate or understand these icons as being gateways into various categories, but that\u2019s why the app also has a main screen where you can browse just by swiping \u2013 something even the youngest kids seem to master quickly.</p><p>Meanwhile, when playing any given video, you can tap on the video itself in order to see thumbnails below that point to other related video suggestions.</p><p>This is the area where YouTube\u2019s main application often failed kids, leading them to videos that weren\u2019t as child-safe as the one they were currently watching. But in the YouTube Kids app, these suggestions have been pre-filtered.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1122903\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/youtube-kids.png?w=680&amp;h=383\" alt=\"youtube-kids\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\"></p><p>A red magnifying glass icon will also allow kids to search across the YouTube Kids\u2019 content for particular items of interest, as opposed to diving into the various categories. This feature will return more results than what\u2019s available in the category sections, pointing kids to more\u00a0\u201csafe\u201d content like tutorials, how-to\u2019s, or other educational content. This is useful because often, kids before would end up looking on YouTube for something that <em>should</em> be child-friendly, like Elmo videos, only to stumble upon <em>very</em>\u00a0inappropriate videos that matched that search term \u2013 like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_Yc7NY0ZCE\">Elmo</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miBQ9jDeujk\">cursing</a>, for instance.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1122905\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/screenshot_2015-02-23-10-57-22.png?w=680&amp;h=383\" alt=\"Screenshot_2015-02-23-10-57-22\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\"></p><p>With the new app, the possibility of kids\u2019 accidentally coming across these sorts of videos is eliminated, though parents can take an extra precaution here if they choose. A parental control option allows them to turn off the Search option altogether, which then limits children to browsing the pre-selected videos instead.</p><p>In addition to the ability to disable Search, YouTube Kids\u2019 parental control settings take a page from competitor<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201240110\"> Amazon\u2019s \u201cKindle FreeTime\u201d service</a> with the introduction of a Timer option. This feature lets parents limit kids\u2019 screen time sessions by configuring a timer to alert the child when their screen time is over.</p><p>This sort of feature\u00a0is useful only up to a point, however. If you\u2019ve handed over the tablet to entertain your kid and they then hit their YouTube video limit, it\u2019s not as if they\u2019ll necessarily put the tablet down. If there are any other games they have installed on the device, YouTube\u2019s \u201csession\u2019s up\u201d alert will only serve to have them move on a new activity on their device.</p><p>The benefit to this feature, though, is that you can limit a child\u2019s\u00a0more passive video watching in favor of the (hopefully) more educational games and/or\u00a0e-books you\u2019ve already installed on their tablet.</p><p>Another setting which could have only come from real-world parents being involved in the YouTube Kids\u2019 app creation is the ability to turn off sound settings for videos. Here, parents can choose to turn off the background music and sound effects included in many kids\u2019 videos, allowing kids to continue to watch without the headache-inducing noise.</p><p>While the YouTube Kids app is definitely a great first step for parents with young children, it currently falls short in a couple of areas. For starters, there\u2019s not a way to narrow down content based on the age of your child.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1122907\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/screenshot_2015-02-23-10-58-47.png?w=680&amp;h=383\" alt=\"Screenshot_2015-02-23-10-58-47\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\"></p><p>That means there\u2019s content in the app aimed at very young toddlers, like BabyFirst TV, that sits alongside content that appeals to the older, perhaps elementary school-aged child, like a video about \u201cSimple but Cool Science Experiments.\u201d\u00a0This can be a bit problematic because in kids\u2019\u00a0early years,\u00a0the differences between what a child aged three is interested in and one aged five, for example, is vast. While it\u2019s not as bad as a child stumbling upon adult content, of course, it\u2019s still not the ideal\u00a0user experience.</p><p>But Ben-Yair says that what\u2019s launching today is only the first step for YouTube Kids.</p><p>\u201cOur experience today is a logged-out experience,\u201d she notes. That means the app doesn\u2019t currently have customizations, but \u201cwe\u2019re definitely looking to explore that,\u201d she adds. A future version of the app could allow parents to better tailor content not only to their child\u2019s age but also their interests, perhaps. Though in doing so,\u00a0Google will have to navigate legal guidelines and regulations around what it means for a child to have a Google account.</p><p>Also of note:\u00a0the parental controls in the app could be accessed today by older children. The app asks parents to enter in numbers corresponding to those numbers spelled out as words. (e.g <em>\u201cTo access, please enter the numbers TWO, ZERO, ONE, FIVE.\u201d</em>) That means the app is only really useful to those parents with young children who are not yet readers. A\u00a0crafty older child will soon be able to figure out how to access this section and disable the Timer, turn search back on, etc.</p><p>But YouTube says that app is aimed at children who are in the \u201cearly literacy\u201d age range primarily. Catering to older kids seems to be a secondary goal, for the time being.</p><p>YouTube Kids is one of several initiatives underway at Google to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/12/google-to-launch-kid-friendly-versions-of-chrome-youtube-others-in-2015/\">develop more products and services aimed at families</a>.\u00a0The company already <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/safetycenter/families/start/\">a family safety center online</a> that teaches parents how to configure web filters and limit access to mobile apps and games, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/12/03/google-products-revamped-for-under-13-crowd/19803447/\">late last year</a>, the company revealed its internal efforts, spearheaded by Googlers with kids of their own, that will see the company bringing kid-friendly versions of other products, including Search and Chrome, as well as YouTube.</p><p>Google says YouTube Kids is available now in the U.S. iTunes App Store (in the Kids section) and on Google Play. The app will also be available on Kurio and nabi kids\u2019 tablets in the future. The company declined to provide a timeline for its release on other platforms or geographies.</p>", "title": ["Hands On With \u201cYouTube Kids,\u201d Google\u2019s Newly Launched, Child-Friendly YouTube App"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

Maybe it\u2019s all of the above, as it turns out.</p><p>The brother and sister team behind\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/imgur\">Imgur</a>,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alan-schaaf\">Alan</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sarah-schaaf\">Sarah Schaaf</a>, took the stage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF this morning to talk about Imgur\u2019s growth from its early days as one of the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/video/best-bootstrapped-startup-imgur-crunchies-awards-2013/518118965/\">best</a> <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/video/best-bootstrapped-startup-imgur-crunchies-awards-2013/518118965/\">bootstrapped</a> startups to a company that has since raised<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/03/after-five-years-of-bootstrapping-imgur-raises-40-million-from-andreessen-reddit/\">\u00a0a $40 million Series A</a> round from Andreessen Horowitz and Reddit to turn its online community into a serious revenue-generating business.</p><p>Though the website today may not have the brand-name recognition of other social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and others, it sees a massive amount of traffic and user engagement.</p><p>TechCrunch editor Josh Constine even teased that Imgur should donate some money to a charity focused on helping with Internet addiction, thanks to the role that Imgur plays in keeping people sucked into their computer screens and phones.</p><p>In that joke was an element of truth, however \u2013 Imgur says it now has\u00a0150 million unique visitors monthly, and some 20 percent of its users are spending over 10 hours per week on the site.</p><p>The company is also up to 65 employees and still growing, Alan said.</p><p>While some may think of Imgur as just a place to browse through humorous or interesting images from all over the web, the founding team thinks of the site a little differently.</p><p>What makes Imgur so compelling goes beyond the content it hosts \u2013 it\u2019s the nature of the site itself. Unlike today\u2019s other social media properties, Imgur is a place\u00a0that\u2019s not tailored around your friends or followers, but is instead a shared experience among its users. Here, people find their own niche communities and other liked-minded folks.</p><p>Another thing that Imgur does, explains Alan, is that it lets\u00a0introverts become extroverts. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to worry about curating their own personal brand,\u201d he says of this crowd. Instead, people can go on Imgur and be themselves while connecting with others like themselves.</p><p>\u201cOver the years, the Internet has been going down the path of\u00a0becoming a more personalized experience,\u201d Alan continues. It\u2019s the same people around us every day, like a mirror of our life, but online, he says.</p><p>\u201cWe want to let people break outside their friends list.\u201d</p><p>People don\u2019t only form friendships on Imgur, but sometimes even relationships. Sarah spoke of some Imgurians (as they call themselves)\u00a0finding love after first meeting on the site.</p><p>But as the company grows, cute stories about its community members won\u2019t be enough. Imgur will have to work harder at maintaining its site\u2019s culture even as it fills with new users, and monetizes through ads as it\u2019s doing now with sponsored posts.</p><p>Along the way, the focus on growth and revenue can derail a site \u2013 just ask Imgur\u2019s sister site Reddit, which nearly imploded after <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/topic/company/reddit/\">a series of missteps by management</a> which angered its community.</p><p>Alan wouldn\u2019t comment in detail on the Reddit situation, but it\u2019s clear that he and Sarah are thoughtfully considering how to keep Imgur\u2019s\u00a0community intact as the site\u00a0scales. For starters, the company doesn\u2019t ship any significant changes to Imgur without first beta testing with its members, or even inviting people into their offices to give feedback. In addition, the team says that transparent communication with users is key.</p><p>\u201cWhen anything goes out on Imgur, the community has already had their hands in that,\u201d says Sarah.</p><p>And when it comes to working with advertisers, the company has developed a \u201cplaybook\u201d detailing\u00a0what makes great sponsored content, which is\u00a0offered to brands who\u00a0want to engage with its online community.</p><p>That has led some of its advertisers \u2013 like eBay and Old Spice, most recently \u2013 to actually get compliments from Imgur\u2019s users in the comments.

To help with that, the company hired seasoned tech exec <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zurlocker\">Zack Urlocker</a> as its new chief operating officer.</p><p>Urlocker has 25 years of experience in the tech world, most recently as the COO of SaaS help desk company Zendesk. He spent two-and-a-half years there before <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/28/zendesk-coo-zack-urlocker-departs-the-company/\">leaving last year</a>, right around the time of <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/16/zendesks-stellar-ipo-and-the-current-tech-ipo-climate/\">the company\u2019s IPO</a>.

Duo now has about 90 employees, 75 of whom are in the Ann Arbor, Mich., area, and plans to grow its Silicon Valley presence soon.</p><p>The company is also focusing more on building out its sales and marketing teams thanks to new funding that it raised in the second half of last year.

{"date": ["2014-09-22"], "text": "<p>Five-year old startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.duosecurity.com\">Duo Security</a> has emerged as a leader in providing secure but easy-to-use two-factor authentication technology to a fast-growing number of enterprise customers. To bolster its growth, the company has raised $12 million in Series B financing from Benchmark, and has added general partner Matt Cohler to its board.</p><p>Two-factor authentication is nothing new. Security-focused enterprises have required their employees to deploy the technology when logging in to applications and services containing sensitive information for the last several decades. But the world is changing, as organizations are looking to embrace more cloud services and employees are demanding enterprise solutions that look more like the consumer applications they use in their everyday lives.</p><p>For a while, enabling two-factor authentication meant using clunky, hardware-based token authentication to ensure that a user was who they said they were. Over time, more and more two-factor authentication solutions have moved to the cloud, requiring users to enter in multi-digit codes they receive via email or SMS.</p><p>In either case, the solution is less-than-ideal for a workforce that is moving increasingly to a bring-your-own-device model for accessing enterprise documents and applications. And with more enterprises moving from on-premises storage and applications to cloud services, the need to lock down sensitive data is more important than ever.</p><p>Duo Security is hoping to leverage those shifts in employee and enterprise behavior to offer two-factor authentication technology that is highly secure but also incredibly easy to use.</p><p>With its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.duosecurity.com/duo-push\">Duo Push authentication technology</a> users can easily approve a mobile device and authenticate with one tap via push notification. While Duo Push is a key differentiator for the company, it also supports more traditional forms of two-factor authentication, including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.duosecurity.com/authentication-methods\">hardware-based tokens and SMS passcodes</a>.</p><p>But making two-factor authentication easier for the user only matters so much unless it works with a variety of different applications and services. On that front, Duo Security supports a number of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.duosecurity.com/cloud\">widely adopted enterprise cloud apps</a> like Salesforce, Microsoft Office, Google Apps, and Box. It can also be used to log into <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.duosecurity.com/vpn\">enterprise VPNs</a> or built into company\u2019s own internal development or collaboration tools via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.duosecurity.com/api\">APIs and a web SDK</a>.</p><p>With the new cash, Duo hopes to ramp up sales and grow its engineering team. Headquartered in Ann Arbor, Mich. with a couple of remote offices on the coasts, the company currently has less than 100 employees. To date, its growth has been driven by what co-founder and CTO Jon Oberheide calls a \u201chigh-velocity, low-touch enterprise sales process.\u201d</p><p>Unlike other enterprise sales organizations, a new Duo customer can \u201cbe up and ready within hours of getting in contact with our sales team,\u201d he said.</p><p>Thanks to its wide support for a variety of apps and flexibility for enterprise deployment, Duo Security has been growing fast, now supporting more than 5,000 enterprise customers. In the tech world, those customers include names like Facebook, Etsy, Box, Yelp, and Threadless, which is how Benchmark\u2019s Matt Cohler came to learn about the company.</p><p>Cohler is probably best known for his connection to consumer-facing companies like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Yelp, but he\u2019s done investments in B2B companies like Zendesk, Domo, and Asana. Still, it was hearing from some employees within that former group of companies that led him to invest.</p><p>\u201cI first heard about [Duo Security] in the same way that we usually hear about companies, which is from our portfolio,\u201d Cohler told me in a phone interview. \u201cThese were all companies that are leaders and have very strong technology organizations, and they were embracing [Duo] with enormous enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>Cohler said Duo\u2019s technology touched on three key themes that are changing when it comes to enterprise applications. The first of those shifts is the consumerization of enterprise apps, and how a consumer-class leader in security has yet to emerge. The second theme is the shift to more enterprise employees bringing their own devices to work. And the third is the shift from on-premise applications to cloud-based services.</p><p>But the most important reason Cohler gave for investing in Duo was just that everyone he talked to raved about Duo Security co-founders Oberheide and CEO Dug Song. \u201cThey are universally admired in the industry, \u201d Cohler told me.</p><p>The new funding comes on top of a $5 million Series A round that had been led by Google Ventures. Previous investors also include True Ventures, Radar Partners, and Resonant Venture Partners.</p>", "title": ["Two-Factor Authentication Startup Duo Security Raises $12 Million From Benchmark"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},
{"date": ["2015-04-14"], "text": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.duosecurity.com/\">Duo Security</a>, the two-factor authentication startup backed by Benchmark and Google Ventures, wants to do more to help protect companies from hackers trying to gain access to their networks. With that goal in mind, it\u2019s launching a new product to secure their networks and announcing $30 million in new funding led by Redpoint Ventures.</p><p>For the last several years, Duo has been focused mostly on bringing easy-to-use and -implement two-factor authentication to enterprise applications. As more enterprises move their data to the cloud and more employees access company documents and systems via mobile devices, Duo\u2019s security offerings were meant to mitigate the risks involved with this new era of computing.</p><p>By leveraging push notifications and other technologies, the company has made sign-ins more secure \u2014 and easier to implement \u2014  for thousands of enterprise customers, including Facebook, Etsy, Box, Yelp, and Threadless. But Duo saw that there was more it could do, that there was a bigger opportunity to protect clients from data breaches from hackers. </p><p>To do that, it\u2019s releasing a new product, called Duo Platform, which will enable IT teams to create policies and automate enforcement of their networks while also tracking the security profiles of devices trying to access their systems.</p><p>The biggest threats to enterprise networks are no longer frontal attacks from hackers trying to gain access to their systems. Today, nearly all data breaches are the result of stolen credentials or compromised devices entering a connecting to a network. Furthermore, attackers frequently lie dormant within compromised systems until long after most security systems stop paying attention.</p><p>Duo\u2019s new Platform product takes advantage of its prior learnings and extends them deeper into customer networks. It enables IT administrators to create more granular rules around who can access its applications and under what conditions. It provides real-time insights into devices trying to connect to their applications and can block data breaches as they\u2019re happening by detecting access-related security threats. </p><p>According to co-founder Jon Oberheide, Duo Platform takes into account a number of factors while actively trying to prevent data breaches. Those include ensuring that a device is healthy, determining whether it is encrypted and if its operating system is up to date, if it\u2019s coming from a location that\u2019s expected or normal, which browser it\u2019s using and which plugins are enabled in that browser, etc.</p><p>By tracking all of these data points, Duo Platform can determine what good and bad access looks like, and block devices accordingly. It can also generate reports on access and authentication, giving administrators better tools for keeping track of the devices and users accessing their networks and applications. </p><p>Duo Platform follows the same sort of revenue model of its other tools, charging enterprises $6 per user, per month for access to the product. That\u2019s double the $3 per user, per month that they currently pay for access to its enterprise edition. But it should provide a lot more protection than its pure two-factor authentication product.</p><p>With the release of the new product, Duo Security sees itself as going after a huge new market opportunity. After all, two-factor authentications is about a $2.5 billion market segment today. But enterprises spend a total of $67 billion on overall security annually.</p><p>The opportunity could be even bigger than that, as Duo makes security more affordable and thus find more customers. As Oberheide notes, there\u2019s currently a \u201csecurity poverty line\u201d that keeps some mid-market companies from being protected as well as larger enterprise peers. </p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so many security products where you have to hire a staff to manage them\u2026 and organizations of that size can\u2019t afford to protect themselves,\u201d Oberheide said. The hope is that by pricing its product within reach of most businesses, Duo Security can grow the overall security pie by enabling more companies to use its tools.</p><p>And that\u2019s part of the reason for the most recent funding. With the newest financing, Duo had raised about $48 million in total, which includes money investors that include Benchmark, Google Ventures, True Ventures, Radar Partners, and Resonant Venture Partners. </p>", "title": ["Duo Security Raises $30 Million Led By Redpoint To Protect Enterprises Against Data Breaches"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

Many users ended up responding to email notifications as a way to continue the conversation around things that were shared with them.</p><p>The hope is that the new messaging feature will enable Pinners to keep conversations going without having to leave the site.</p><p>Believe it or not, the messaging feature has been only a few months in the making. According to Product Manager <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/michael-yamartino\">Michael Yamartino,</a> the messaging feature was the result of a prototyping session that took place over the course of a week in Portland.</p><p>A team of five made the trip north to work with Product Designer Tom Watson, formerly of Facebook. They\u00a0lived out of an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb\">Airbnb</a> and worked out of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.piepdx.com/\">Portland Incubator Experiment (PIE)</a> for five days. On Friday, they had the first Messaging prototype.</p><p>That was about two months ago. Since then, Pinterest has been working internally with employees and so-called \u201cPower Pinners\u201d to refine the product. That meant working out the kinks, and to ensure that the user experience wouldn\u2019t take away from what users come to the service to do \u2014 which is to Pin stuff.</p><p>Pinterest\u2019s take on messaging is similar to what you\u2019ll see on other social networks, but there are some key differences. One of those differences is that unlike Facebook, Pinterest\u2019s messaging feature doesn\u2019t have a persistent contact list that follows you around everywhere.\u00a0That\u2019s by design. Pinterest doesn\u2019t want its service to become about messaging, but wants messaging to empower the way people use its platform.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not a communications service,\u201d Yamartino said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be the place to say \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 or \u2018When are you coming home?'\u201d</p><p>When users choose to Send a Pin, they are shown a list of contacts to choose from. Once that Pin is sent, the conversation appears in the lower left-hand corner of the website or tablet app. (Mobile users will be treated to an entirely separate dialogue screen for messages.)</p><p>The avatars of users that you\u2019ve exchanged messages with look kind of like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/07/chat-multi-tasking/\">Facebook\u2019s \u201cchat heads,\u201d</a> and conversations can be selected by clicking on them. They can be just as easily shut down by clicking the \u201cx\u201d in the corner of each. On the website, avatars and conversations only partially cover the frames behind them, allowing Pinners to scroll through and still see the content shared in their global feed.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1040737\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/pinterest-web.png?w=1024&amp;h=629\" alt=\"pinterest web\" width=\"1024\" height=\"629\"></p><p>There are a few nifty features that could lead to messaging blowing up. For instance, Pinterest has introduced its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/24/pinterest-guided-search/\">Guided Search</a> directly into the messages field, so that Pinners can search for, discover, and share content that is relevant to the conversation they are having on the fly.</p><p>That means new ways of sharing and collaborating on things via Pins. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a home remodeling project with your wife, for instance. Now you can swap ideas back and forth without sharing in your global feed.</p><p>Or let\u2019s say you\u2019re planning a trip with a group. Now the entire entourage can use Pins as a way to collaborate on places to go and set an agenda. Which reminds me\u2026 Pinterest Messaging is available for groups, in addition to one-on-one conversations. Up to 10 people can share Pins with one another.</p><p>\u201cWe think that a lot of the projects people take on\u2026 they do this with friend or partner,\u201d Yamartino told me. \u201cBeing able to have that conversation on Pinterest is convenient for them.\u201d</p><p>For Pinterest, it also means keeping the conversation on its platform. That will lead to more Pins being shared, and more engaged users. For a network like Pinterest, where user engagement is its most valuable currency, that\u2019s a very, very good thing.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/w6BIchm_iQg?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></span></p>", "title": ["Pinterest Rolls Out Messaging So Pinners Can Have Conversations Around Shared Pins"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

The Commission, which is tasked with regulating privately owned electric, telecommunications, water, transit, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/puc/transportation/\">passenger transportation companies</a>, is now trying to figure out how ride-sharing companies fall into its regulatory framework. But in the meantime, it\u2019s been asking them to get off the road.</p><p>The letters sent to ride-sharing startups have apparently had little effect: While served more than a month ago, they\u2019re <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Putting-brakes-on-ride-sharing-apps-3927193.php\">just coming into the public eye now</a>. And in the meantime, Lyft, Sidecar, and Tickengo have all remained on the road with no apparent shutdown in service.</p><p>Zimride co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.lyft.me/post/33165777110/lyft-community-update\">addressed the letter in a blog post</a> this morning, defending Lyft\u2019s operations in spite of the regulatory scrutiny. Zimmer and Green characterized Lyft as just one more evolution in ride-sharing, which moved from physical ride boards at universities, to postings on Craigslist, to Zimride\u2019s own social platform online, to mobile devices through apps like Lyft.</p><p>According to Zimmer, the letters that were sent out were part of the CPUC\u2019s effort to understand how new technologies would fit under its current regulatory framework. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the technologies we use were never imagined when these regulations were written,\u201d Zimmer told me by phone.</p><p>Since receiving the letter, he says Lyft has been engaged in productive conversations with the Commission, and that the regulator has a better understanding of how its service works. Key to that understanding is convincing the Commission that Lyft operates in full compliance with that law, and that it already holds itself to a higher standard than other transportation services are expected to comply with. \u201cWhen you look at our criteria for background or driver checks, it\u2019s above and beyond what the limo services do,\u201d Zimmer told me.</p><p>For its part, Lyft runs potential drivers through a number of checks before allowing them to affix a pink moustache to their cars. That includes DMV and criminal background checks, followed by in-person interviews and vehicle inspections. Last we checked, about 5 percent of applicants are accepted as drivers, though it\u2019s been ramping up its fleet quickly, so that percentage might have changed. Lyft now has upwards of 250 drivers on board, compared to just 100 when it <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/25/lyft-san-francisco-launch/\">officially launched to the public in August</a>.</p><p>Sidecar also received a notice, even before Lyft, founder Sunil Paul told me by email. According to Paul, the letter asked Sidecar to cease and desist operating a \u201ccharter party carrier,\u201d which requires a license. Since he believes Sidecar is not a charter party carrier, the startup has remained on the road.</p><p>Paul writes that Sidecar is coming under scrutiny because it is a successful innovator \u201cupsetting the status quo,\u201d but that it was carefully designed to be 100 percent legal. \u201cWe are innovators committed to public safety. We built a system with safety in mind and will continue to expand safety and insurance features in the coming months,\u201d Paul wrote.</p><p>He also sought to differentiate Sidecar from other ride-sharing services. For one thing, he wrote, drivers know the destination of potential passengers, and so can choose whether or not they would like to pick them up. It also doesn\u2019t suggest a donation or set a price like other apps, instead using software to calculate the average price of a ride.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tickengo co-founder Geoff Mathieux claims to be a true peer-to-peer collaborative transportation platform \u201cmeant to fill empty seats in regular cars,\u201d and is not to be used for commercial purposes. While drivers on some other services are taking several passengers a day, that\u2019s not Tickengo\u2019s goal. In fact, it limits the amount drivers can make on a yearly basis to AAA\u2019s official annual cost of vehicle ownership, which is currently $8,776 per year.</p><p>Mathieux also sets Tickengo apart by saying that it\u2019s merely a platform for connecting individuals, not unlike the old ride boards Lyft alluded to above. \u201cWe are not engaged in the operation, hiring, or maintenance of driving professionals or commercial transportation vehicles,\u201d he wrote in an email.</p><p>While other services have either booked additional insurance to cover accidents during shared rides (Lyft), or are looking to do so (Sidecar), Tickengo says it has no need to. \u201cDrivers on Tickengo don\u2019t give rides several times a day like the others,\u201d Mathieux writes, therefore the trips shouldn\u2019t be considered livery or commercial. On that basis, driver insurance policies should be adequate to cover any damages that occur during one of its rides.</p><p>Of course, the new ride-sharing companies are hardly the first tech startups to face scrutiny from local regulatory agencies: Uber also received a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/24/ubercab-ordered-to-cease-and-desist/\">cease-and-desist letter from the CPUC</a>, and has come under fire from regulators and government agencies in a number of other markets that it operates in, including New York, Chicago, and Boston. Like Uber before it, Lyft plans to continue operating while the regulatory issues are worked out.</p><p>While the CPUC is still trying to figure out how ride-sharing fits under its regulatory purview, Lyft and others might get some aid from San Francisco\u2019s new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sfciti.com/initiatives#collaborative-consumption-working-group-the-sharing-economy\">Collaborative Consumption Working Group</a>, which is trying to understand the issues faced by companies like Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Getaround, and others that have created peer-to-peer marketplaces that allow users to more efficiently share resources, assets, or skills. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee is a big fan of the sharing economy, and this group seems committed to helping those companies overcome challenges related to entrenched industries and regulations that don\u2019t take into account new technologies.</p>", "title": ["While The California PUC Cracks Down On Ride-Sharing, Sidecar And Lyft Commit To Staying On The Road"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

It\u2019s able to do that because it is renting out cars that would have otherwise been left in long-term parking.</p><p>It\u2019s not that different from existing peer-to-peer rental services, except that it specializes in multi-day rentals at airports, whereas companies like RelayRides, Getaround, and Wheelz are focused on short-term rentals in cities. The service has first launched at San Francisco International Airport, with plans to expand to other airports in the future.</p><p>For car owners, allowing their vehicles to be rented is not just a way to save on parking, but also to potentially make some money while they\u2019re out of town. While travelers would typically pay about $18 a day to keep their car in Long Term Parking, FlightCar lets users keep their car at the company\u2019s lot \u2014 provided that they are willing to let the startup rent out their cars while they\u2019re gone.</p><p>FlightCar provides a valet service when travelers are at the airport and ready to drop their cars off.

But today the regulator <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M036/K204/36204017.PDF\">agreed to evaluate the safety of those services</a>, in what  in what could be a big step toward legitimizing ride-sharing in the state.</p><p>The CPUC, which regulates charter-party carriers in California, will be taking a look at services that \u201cutilize the Internet, social media, and location services\u201d as a way to connect drivers and riders. The regulator named ride-sharing services Lyft and SideCar, as well as Uber, as the types of services that it would evaluate in determining some balance between public safety and innovation.</p><p>While there\u2019s still a lot left to be determined, the good news is that the CPUC is backing away from a more combative stance in which it was seeking to shut these services down. In August, it issued cease-and-desist letters against Lyft, SideCar, and Tickengo for operating unlicensed charter-party services. About a month ago, it went a step further by issuing citations and $20,000 fines against the two ride-sharing services, as well as Uber.</p><p>The Order Instituting Rulemaking could potentially create a new framework for ride-sharing services that legitimizes their operation. Currently, Lyft and SideCar don\u2019t fit under its current charter-party classification. At the same time, they argue that their background checks, as well as reputation management systems that come from user-submitted ratings, go above and beyond existing CPUC regulations. The Order states: </p><p>In evaluating these new services, the CPUC is seeking comment on issues related to \u201cconsumer protection and safety implications of the new methods for arranging transportation services; whether and how the new transportation business models differ from longstanding forms of ridesharing; and the new transportation business models\u2019 potential impact on insurance and transportation access.\u201d Those who wish to comment will be able to do so over the next 30 days, and the CPUC plans to come to a ruling sometime over the next six months.</p><p>California isn\u2019t the only state looking to revise transportation regulations due to new services cropping up.

Although most car rental services try to offer a variety of makes and models (and usually struggling to provide it), Silvercar is taking that choice out of the equation completely. Befitting its name, Silvercar\u2019s fleet consists exclusively of silver 2013 Audi A4s. Luckily for those freedom of choice fighters, it\u2019s a pretty good looking car.</p><p>As to how it works: The Silvercar experience intends to be fully mobile. The startup will offer a smartphone app later this year, which will allow users to book a car in advance and manage their vehicle settings through their personal profiles. Riders will be able to unlock their silver Audis by scanning the vehicle with their smartphones, at which point the service will automatically push itineraries, destinations, etc. to the car\u2019s multimedia dashboard.</p><p>The goal of the mobile experience is to remove check-in lines and counters from the airport car rental experience, allowing those with reservations to go straight to their cars, which are guaranteed to be premium thanks to Silvercar\u2019s \u201cno clunkers, just Audis\u201d policy. For those who forget to book in advance, Silvercar provides self-serve kiosks and on-site assistance.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2013-audi-a4-fd.jpg\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/2013-audi-a4-fd.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199\" alt=\"\" title=\"2013-audi-a4-fd\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-672057\"></a> According to Silvercar CEO Luke Schneider (formerly the CTO of Zipcar and head of its FastFleet division), the price of rentals will be comparable to standard and full-sized cars from the big car rental companies.</p><p>Schneider, who worked at Flexcar before it merged with Zipcar, has a lot of experience in the car rental business, so it will be interesting to see how Silvercar comes out of the gates.

By\u00a0directly customizing\u00a0things for ourselves, our social and personal biases restrict the way we expose\u00a0ourselves to new information.</p><p>Additionally, it\u00a0becomes hard to estimate how\u00a0much personalization actually happens automatically and how it helps us in\u00a0discovering things. The wider the pool of\u00a0information, the more we have to work\u00a0to detect the signal from the noise.</p><p>At the same time, the user experience of a purely machine-powered\u00a0approach hasn\u2019t still crossed the \u201cuncanny valley.\u201d A machine telling us what\u00a0we\u00a0should be seeing and doing next has a dystopian aura, even in very mundane\u00a0circumstances. Many times the algorithmic suggestions that don\u2019t directly\u00a0reflect our social environment or past interactions appear to be too obtrusive\u00a0or outright ridiculous. Indeed, machine-powered Google Now focuses on\u00a0delivering\u00a0useful information instead of new explorative choices.</p><p>Discovery currently exists as a category of Internet\u00a0services and apps, as well as a functional feature in some content-specific\u00a0platforms (e.g., <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/\">Spotify</a>\u00a0and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/\">Snapchat</a>). But no one has come up with a universal\u00a0Discovery paradigm for the mainstream audience.</p><p>There are five main challenges faced by the universal Discovery\u00a0solution:</p><p><strong>Clear Value\u00a0Proposition And Use Case.\u00a0</strong>Universal Discovery lacks a clearly defined value proposition, and thus a crystal clear use case. Why do you need universal Discovery\u00a0in the first\u00a0place? In Search we are looking for specific and relevant answers.\u00a0In Social we\u2019re connecting and communicating with other people. But how do you\u00a0define a universal value proposition and use case for something so highly\u00a0subjective and contextual\u00a0as Discovery?</p><p>People don\u2019t think consciously\u00a0that they are \u201cdiscovering\u201d something. They might not even recognize\u00a0a need for \u201cdiscovery.\u201d On the contrary, a discovery happens often as\u00a0a by-product of some other activity.</p><p><strong>Frictionless User\u00a0Experience.\u00a0</strong>Current mainstream user interfaces and experiences haven\u2019t\u00a0been designed, developed or optimized for Discovery. For example, the news feed\u00a0and its\u00a0variations provide a very linear and limited way of presenting\u00a0information. Personalized Discovery requires a new design approach because finding\u00a0interesting\u00a0choices includes potential effort and friction.</p><p>Trial and error can form a\u00a0significant part of the exploration process. Friction emerges when\u00a0we encounter\u00a0unexpected choices or when we need to wait for something to happen. Additionally, the\u00a0experience should proactively pique our curiosity,\u00a0simultaneously outweighing\u00a0our personal and social biases.</p><p><strong>Technologies For Adaptive\u00a0Personalization And Content Presentation.</strong> Creating a universal Discovery solution brings together two\u00a0major technological challenges: unobtrusive personalization and sleek content delivery.\u00a0Adaptive personalization requires an unseen level of automated customization\u00a0based on our intricate selves. To achieve this, the system needs to be\u00a0able to\u00a0capture our meaningful interactions and utilize our diverse personal data.</p><p>Current\u00a0applications of personalization using human curation,\u00a0algorithmic systems and\u00a0machine learning methods \u2014 or their combinations\u00a0\u2014 don\u2019t yet learn or deliver\u00a0fast enough, nor do they let us express ourselves\u00a0as unique individuals. Concurrently,\u00a0the various forms and types of digital content are messy, and require a lot of sophisticated\u00a0processing to be\u00a0presented fluently in various screens and devices.</p><p><strong>Accessible Data And\u00a0Content.\u00a0</strong>The almost infinite sea we call the Internet has become a collection\u00a0of confined ponds with their own walls and rules. Platforms build their own understanding\u00a0of you, and usually they don\u2019t let you control how your data could\u00a0be used for your own benefit in other places.</p><p>Simultaneously, an increasing\u00a0amount\u00a0of content is becoming platform-exclusive. Major social platforms are\u00a0becoming content silos, enabling exploration on their own terms and only inside\u00a0their own boundaries. Media houses are locking their content behind specific\u00a0access points.</p><p><strong>Discovery Paradox.\u00a0</strong>Additionally, there\u2019s an inherent tension in combining\u00a0personalization and Discovery. Personalization is about customizing your\u00a0experience, guiding\u00a0your choices and serving information based on your needs\u00a0and personal preferences. Then again, discovery refers to the things that are\u00a0somehow new\u00a0and surprising. Indeed, discovery can be as much about questions as\u00a0it is about answers. It can be as much about irrational and serendipitous as it is\u00a0about rational and relevant.</p><p>The things that you recognize as meaningful discoveries\u00a0aren\u2019t necessarily what you expect them to be. You might\u00a0encounter something\u00a0you didn\u2019t know you wanted or you didn\u2019t even know existed. A discovery can be very\u00a0personal and context-specific, thus being\u00a0meaningful only to you.</p><p>So, is there a way to overcome this multitude of complex\u00a0challenges? Or is the universal Discovery solution just a Fata Morgana of the\u00a0early age of\u00a0personalization?</p><p>A truly smart universal Discovery system makes sense. The\u00a0amount of information is exploding, and we need better methods to make sense of\u00a0it. At the\u00a0same time, the current tools provide only a restricted access to the\u00a0information that is beyond our personal and social bubbles.</p><p>Personalized Discovery can find a balance between relevance\u00a0and serendipity, as well as rewards and friction, by creating favorable discovery\u00a0conditions for you as a unique individual. The system understands your\u00a0articulated and ambient interests by mapping the unique connections you see\u00a0around you.</p><p>A universal Discovery system provides choices instead of the one\u00a0specific answer. By understanding your interests, the system can expose\u00a0you to\u00a0things that you find surprising, even challenging. Simultaneously, it provides\u00a0meaningful information in easily digestible chunks that let you\u00a0choose your\u00a0preferred level of engagement. The presentation is modified based on\u00a0content form, type and context. To serve content from diverse\u00a0sources, the\u00a0Discovery system taps into the free as well as paid content pools on your\u00a0behalf.</p><p>As the amount of potentially discoverable information is\u00a0almost infinite, human curation and algorithmic methods are used to complement\u00a0each other.\u00a0Curation can be made a seamless part of the basic Discovery flow.\u00a0Your actions curate content for other people and educate the system at the same\u00a0time. The nuanced human assessment of quality is thus interwoven to the\u00a0machine-powered dynamics such as prioritizing recommendations and\u00a0presenting\u00a0information.</p><p>In Discovery, goal-driven and casual experiences can coexist.\u00a0The system brings together various content and action categories such as books,\u00a0music,\u00a0movies, travel, food, dating and news. By understanding your preferences\u00a0with movies and the latest pop culture news \u2014 and being able to detect your\u00a0current\u00a0mood \u2014 the Discovery system recommends new interesting music choices. Also, it can surface interesting weak signals and\u00a0unseen\u00a0opportunities. By understanding your daily activities, it can serve a surprising\u00a0micro-eureka moment when you get trapped in your mundane\u00a0routines.</p><p>Maybe Discovery itself is an ambient system. It\u2019s present\u00a0and available in the background, only activating when it makes sense to you. Time-consuming\u00a0complex stuff is hidden under the hood. The system notifies you when something\u00a0is happening or already waiting for you. Such a\u00a0Discovery solution is your\u00a0never-sleeping intelligent extension that doesn\u2019t need continuous actions from\u00a0your part.</p><p>This would be more in tune with\u00a0our natural experience of discovering\u00a0new, interesting things almost coincidentally. When digital and physical become\u00a0more and more entangled,\u00a0ambient Discovery can be the new user experience paradigm\u00a0for VR.</p><p>However, could any Discovery technology help us to find anything\u00a0truly new and meaningful if we\u2019re not open to exploration ourselves? Maybe a\u00a0well-tuned Discovery system could educate us to be more open toward diversity\u00a0and serendipity. And, potentially, finding the right dynamics for\u00a0personalized\u00a0Discovery could be the key for creating more human-centered and diverse digital\u00a0experiences for all of us.</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": ["Is Personalized Discovery A Feature, Category Or New Paradigm"], "author": ["Jarno M.

{"date": ["2015-01-18"], "text": "<p>\u201cIn the next five years, you\u2019ll see somebody introduce autonomous vehicles,\u201d Ford CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fields_%28businessman%29\">Mark Fields</a> said at a small dinner for press and analysts during CES. He was quick to qualify that statement (only in very defined areas, during good weather, etc.), but that\u2019s one of the few statements that stuck out from the fog of war that is spending a week in Vegas during <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/ces/\">CES</a>.</p><p>For years, self-driving cars looked like they were always at least ten years away from coming to market. If the notoriously conservative car industry thinks we are only five years away from somebody selling an autonomous car, then we\u2019re probably even closer than they expect.</p><p>Every major car manufacturer now makes the pilgrimage to Vegas in January to present its latest advances next to Samsung, Toshiba and hordes of Chinese iPhone case manufacturer \u2014 and if there was is one topic that they all wanted to talk about, it was its self-driving cars. And it wasn\u2019t just the car manufacturers, it was also the chip makers. Nvidia used most of its keynote to give us a rather boring lecture on how its new chips and recent advances in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://deeplearning.net/\">deep learning</a> will enable self-driving cars using only cameras instead of expensive sensors (most car industry experts still think other sensors are absolutely necessary, by the way). All of the products it hyped up during its time on stage were for cars and its booth <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/video/nvidias-upgrading-the-automobile/518588645/\">featured three sports cars</a>. Qualcomm <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/05/qualcomm-announces-some-stuff/\">didn\u2019t quite focus on cars quite as much,</a>\u00a0but it announced a number of concept cars that use its chips. Intel <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/06/intel-promises-300m-to-boost-the-representation-of-women-and-minorities-in-tech/\">talked</a> about autonomy in the context of drones, but there\u2019s no doubt it also wants to put its sensors into cars.</p><p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-1106933\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_4864.jpg?w=405&amp;h=205\" alt=\"IMG_4864\" width=\"405\" height=\"205\">Google obviously wants to play a role in this business, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/17/6982289/tesla-autopilot-is-a-non-revolution-for-self-driving-cars\">does Tesla</a>, but despite all of the hype around their projects, Detroit (and Wolfsburg and Munich and Stuttgart and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota,_Aichi\">Toyota</a>) may yet beat them to market. All of them are testing some kind of autonomous cars right now. Audi even drove five journalists from L.A. to Vegas in self-driving cars (only Audi prefers to call it \u201cpiloted driving,\u201d maybe because you can\u2019t start branding future technologies too early). Ford says it has autonomous cars on the road right now and the same is pretty much true for everybody else, too.</p><p>Five years isn\u2019t a lot of time, however, and there are plenty of unanswered questions around autonomous driving that still need to be answered. Who is at fault when an autonomous car crashes? How do you keep drivers from getting inattentive and how (and when) do you best hand control back to them? How do you keep drivers from getting carsick? Will driving still be fun? In the long run, there is also a risk for automakers that autonomous cars will change our relationship with our cars and have us rely more on car-sharing services. If that happens, they will sell fewer cars (but for now, growth is still good \u2014 especially in Asia \u2014 so they don\u2019t seem too worried about it).</p><p><img class=\"  wp-image-1106940 alignleft\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/1413566426241.jpg?w=400&amp;h=225\" alt=\"1413566426241\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\">But there are other questions, too. Because autonomous cars will mostly likely have to rely on highly detailed maps, drivers will have to have an ongoing relationship with the manufacturers in order to receive regular updates for them. Does that mean we, as drivers, will have to subscribe to those maps? Will car manufacturers band together and share mapping data?</p><p>There are also still many regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome before we can sit in the driver\u2019s seat and watch the landscape go by while an increasing complex and smart array of sensors and computers handle the driving for us. Everybody I talked to at CES was sure that whatever would hold autonomous cars back wasn\u2019t going to be technology.</p><p>The incumbent U.S. car manufacturers may not be the first to bring autonomous cars to market, though. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s less about who is first to market and more about who is the last to have an accident,\u201d a Ford representative told me at one point during the week. A few major accidents in a litigious society like the U.S., after all, will set the whole industry back years. And consumers will not buy these cars until they are absolutely sure they are safe \u2014 and because all drivers think they are great drivers, the autonomous cars have to be significantly better.</p><p>So over the next few years, expect cars to slowly gain more autonomous features. Adaptive cruise control will morph into a feature that will drive your car autonomously in traffic jams. Lane keeping alerts will turn into real lane keeping while you drive down the highway. Assisted parking will turn into fully autonomous parking. And all of these advances \u2014 plus many others \u2014 will accumulate over time. Hopefully this slow burn will help regulators to keep up and develop a framework that allows the integration of autonomous cars into regular traffic.</p><p>Then, as a final step, we will probably see highways and parts of cities where hand-steered cars will be outlawed because humans are simply too unpredictable and inefficient.</p>", "title": ["Autonomous Cars Are Closer Than You Think"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},
{"date": ["2015-08-22"], "text": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ford.com\">Ford</a> was one of the first major car manufacturers to bring connected car technology to its lineup with Sync in 2007, but while the first iterations of its Sync and \u2014 later \u2014 MyFord Touch infotainment systems were ahead of their time in the car world, they were also rather slow, cluttered and clunky.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/11/ford-ditches-microsoft-for-qnx-in-latest-in-vehicle-tech-platform/\">Sync 3</a>, which is now available on the 2016 Ford Escape compact SUV and Fiesta subcompact, is a welcome departure from\u00a0all of that.\u00a0Instead of trying to be innovative for the sake of it, Sync 3 goes back to the basics and provides drivers with\u00a0an infotainment system that stays out of the way and simply works.</p><p>Ford lent me a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ford.com/suvs/escape/gallery/photos/\">2016 Escape</a> earlier this month to get some hands-on experience with the new system.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1199371\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/ford-1-4.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680\" alt=\"ford-1-4\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\"></p><p>The last two iterations of Sync (the technology) and MyFord Touch (the touch-screen based interface to it) were based on Microsoft Auto.\u00a0After reviewers and consumers panned the first version, the company decided that it wanted to give drivers the opportunity to update their cars to the next version. That, however, meant that Ford was able to make a lot of software changes that made the last version significantly better than the first (though still far from great), but stuck with\u00a0the same slow hardware to ensure compatibility.</p><p>Ford switched to BlackBerry\u2019s QNX for Sync 3 and while switching screens and zooming around the built-in navigation system doesn\u2019t quite feel as smooth as on an iPad just yet, everything still feels plenty fast. In earlier versions, it sometimes felt like you were fighting against the system \u2014 now it works with you.</p><p>Sync 3 is a complete redesign of the earlier versions. Its focus\u00a0on large icons and easy to read text makes using the system about as easy as using an 8-inch touchscreen while driving gets.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1199370\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/ford-1-3.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680\" alt=\"ford-1-3\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\"></p><p>For the most part, all of the most often used features like climate and volume control still have physical counterparts on the center stack and wheel (at least in the Escape I drove).\u00a0For changing the volume, those physical knobs will always remain easier to use than screens, but when it comes to navigation or interacting with apps, Ford\u2019s\u00a0focus on a utilitarian design over fanciful flourishes helps you to get things done fast and your eyes back on the road.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1199372\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/ford-1-5.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680\" alt=\"ford-1-5\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\"></p><p>Voice control, of course, is also always an option (and probably the safer one). Over the years, Ford has gotten better at this, but don\u2019t expect a Siri- or Google-like experience. You can\u2019t just start chatting with Sync. \u201cOK Sync, please set the temperature to 72 degrees\u201d won\u2019t get you very far (but Sync 3 integrates with Siri\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/what-siris-eyes-free-feature-means-for-cars/\">Eyes Free</a> feature if you have an iPhone).\u00a0Sync still needs you to\u00a0stick to a small set of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://owner.ford.com/how-tos/sync-technology/myford-touch/in-vehicle-settings/explore-climate-by-voice.html\">pre-programmed voice commands</a>. Voice recognition works extremely well, but\u00a0I tend to find using voice\u00a0more distracting than just changing the temperature by hand.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1199391\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/ford-1-8.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680\" alt=\"ford-1-8\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\">Like the rest of the system, the navigation feature (which costs an extra $795) does exactly what it is meant to do (and you can get updates over WiFiwhen you\u2019re at home). It now features lane guidance, which wasn\u2019t all that useful on our trip to the Oregon coast, but makes a world of difference when you\u2019re driving through a new city.</p><p>Unlike other car makers, Ford always bet that drivers would bring their own connectivity <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/12/fords-applink-will-soon-support-third-party-navigation-apps/\">and apps</a> to the car. Sync 3 is no exception. Like in previous versions, a small number of approved apps like Pandora, Spotify, Glympse and iHeartRadio can interact with Sync directly and let you interact with them using the touchscreen and physical controls. My trusty old Nexus 5 had some issues connecting over Bluetooth at first, but once it did, everything worked as advertised.</p><p>With Sync 3, Ford has finally released an infotainment system that brings together all of the\u00a0disparate technologies it developed over the last few years (Sync \u2014 which actually debuted in 2007, MyFord Touch, and AppLink for\u00a0connecting the car to apps on your phone) into a single platform.\u00a0While it was one of the first to offer these technologies, others\u00a0car makers now offer similar functionality. \u00a0Ford says Sync 3 may support Apple\u2019s CarPlay and Android Car in the future, but it\u2019s unclear when/if that will happen.</p><p>For now, one thing is clear:\u00a0Sync 3 is\u00a0a reason to give Ford another look if you\u2019re in the market for a new car \u2014 and that\u2019s not something I would\u2019ve said about its first iterations.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1199394\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/ford-1-9.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=681\" alt=\"ford-1-9\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\"></p>", "title": ["Hands-On With Ford\u2019s Sync 3"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},

This will allow Ford drivers with compatible cars, including the 2012 Fiesta, Fusion, F-150, Super Duty, E-Series, Mustang and Expedition, to use their voice and in-dash controls to control the MOG app on their USB-connected smartphones.</p><p>Through AppLink, drivers will be able to access MOG\u2019s on-demand radio features, program radio station presets based on artists they like, select playlists and play songs from Billboard\u2019s Top 50 by using voice commands like \u201csimilar artists,\u201d \u201clist playlists\u201d and \u201ctop songs.\u201d</p><p>Despite <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/20/htc-where-innovation-is-bought-and-thats-a-good-thing/\">rumors</a> earlier this year that MOG was getting acquired by HTC, this acquisition hasn\u2019t materialized yet. The service currently offer users access to about 15 million songs on its iOS and Android app. The arrival of Spotify has obviously put some pressure on MOG, but the service, which was founded in 2005, continues to hum along nicely. To use MOG\u2019s mobile apps, users have to subscribe to the service\u2019s $9.99/month plan.</p><p>Other music-related apps currently supported by AppLink include Pandora, iHeartRadio, Stitcher SmartRadio, Slacker and NPR. Twitter fans who can\u2019t bear to drive without knowing that they\u2019re still connected to their favorite social network can also use OpenBeak to have AppLink read incoming tweets to you. I had a chance to test Pandora and AppLink in a 2012 Mustang earlier this year and it worked surprisingly well. It takes a moment to learn the voice commands, but once you have those down, the voice recognition system tends to work very well.</p><p>While Ford makes a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://secure.syncmyride.com/Own/Modules/Developer/Subscribe.aspx\">developer kit</a>\u00a0for AppLink available to developers, though, the program is still invite-only and the company is only working with a few select developers right now.

In addition to GM, Audi equips its vehicles with\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/audi-upgrading-existing-3g-service-with-speedier-in-car-lte-data-chip/\">Gemalto enabled</a>\u00a0mobile hotspot services through its Audi Connect service and Ford\u2019s new Sync 3, powered by BlackBerry\u2019s QNX, is included in more than\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/ford-swaps-microsoft-blackberry-sync-3/296229/\">30 million vehicles spanning 250 models</a>.</p><p>Because vehicle manufacturers are leveraging IoT platforms that enable connectivity via a network of mobile operators, passengers can connect their laptops, smartphones and tablets to the car to surf the Internet, watch movies and access social media. And for drivers, they\u2019re\u00a0loyal to the manufacturers who enable them to enjoy the benefits of this new in-car experience increases.</p><p>Over-the-air (OTA) software updates in cars are very similar to the software updates that occur in smartphones. Any software update for a vehicle\u2019s connected services is done wirelessly OTA, keeping the OEM in contact with the vehicle but removing the need for a dealership visit.</p><p>This matters because in the past year alone,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/business/a-year-of-record-recalls-galvanizes-auto-industry-into-action.html\">over 60 million</a>\u00a0cars were recalled in the U.S., many attributed to software glitches. The cost \u2013 and burden \u2013 that recalls place on the driver and the vehicle manufacturer can be severe.</p><p>Many manufacturers are making strides to increase OTA offerings. Thanks to Gemalto, Audi provides features such as parking and gas prices using OTA updates on its Audi Connect solution, while GM has been offering OTA updates to its Bluetooth platform using the OnStar embedded connectivity platform. OTA updates are slowly becoming an industry standard \u2013\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://telematicsnews.info/2014/11/20/la-new-chrysler-300-features-upgraded-ecall-and-uconnect-telematics_n5209/\">Chrysler Uconnect</a>,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/196618-best-tech-cars-of-2014\">Mercedes-Benz mbrace</a>,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.luxurydaily.com/bmw-aims-to-equip-connecteddrive-service-with-real-time-maps/\">BMW ConnectedDrive</a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/2486446/internet/smartphone-users-struggle-connecting-to-in-car-infotainment-systems.html\">Toyota Entune</a>\u00a0systems regularly send firmware OTA updates to fix software glitches in their vehicles.</p><p>Sure, cars have been enabling us to connect our devices via Bluetooth to make calls and navigate \u2013 but what about the ability to use your favorite streaming apps to get the content you love without having to fiddle with your phone while driving and consuming valuable data plans? By leveraging the always-on connectivity that IoT provides, today\u2019s connected car manufacturers are providing an entirely new interface for delivering and interacting with streaming content services like Spotify or Pandora.</p><p>IoT platforms also provide an easy way for content providers to monetize their services and optimize them for the connected car environment. Vehicle manufacturers, premium content providers, and even brick-and-mortar retailers can use IoT to give car owners a free trial of their services or other offers. OnStar\u2019s new\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2015/Jan/0104-atyourservice-gm.html\">AtYourService</a>\u00a0feature brings commerce directly to the car, connecting retailers to drivers while they\u2019re on the road. Online coupon services like RetailMeNot and Entertainment Book can deliver shopping coupons to the car\u2019s dashboard for retailers located in the driver\u2019s direction.</p><p>And IoT isn\u2019t just about getting the service to the car \u2013 it also enables providers to track usage (or non-usage) patterns, prompt drivers to try new features, top up a diminishing data allotment or upgrade the service when the time is right. IoT has become the strategic platform to help deliver and monetize these services.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p>Safety and security remain the most important aspects of any vehicle. And with today\u2019s connected cars, IoT enables the vehicle to continue to fulfill that role even after an accident has occurred. For example, IoT empowers pre-installed services like Volkswagen\u2019s Car-Net with 24/7 automatic crash notification, which can automatically alert emergency services when an accident has occurred.</p><p>These possibly life-saving features are wholly dependent on reliable, low-latency connectivity, because a delay in notification (and the resulting delay in medical response) can literally mean the difference between life or death.</p><p>Another emerging value-added service enabled by IoT is usage-based insurance (UBI), which tracks a driver\u2019s behavior to establish a personalized insurance rate plan for each driver. Whereas insurance providers were previously limited to providing rates based on general factors like age, average mileage, accident and history, IoT provides a myriad of opportunities for customization.</p><p>For example, Allstate\u2019s Drivewise program uses a small device deployed in your vehicle to collect information about your driving style. Data points collected include speed, brake activity and the time of day you drive. By collecting this data, Allstate can customize rates for each driver, incentivizing safe driving behavior and reducing premiums. Allstate has also\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.insurancetech.com/allstate-forms-pact-with-connected-vehicle-services-company-airbiquity/d/d-id/1313335?\">partnered with Airbiquity</a>, a provider of connected vehicle services, to further develop the insurer\u2019s Roadside Assistance program offerings that leverage driving data.</p><p>A number of startups are building off this idea of collecting driver data. Commercial plug-in modules like those from start-up Mojio connect cars to the cloud via embedded radio links and upload hundreds of data points about the car every minute, tracking everything from the brakes to the locks. It then uses these data points to provide connected car services in partnership with apps like\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2014/concur-launches-new-app-ease-tracking-driving-expenses/\">Concur</a>\u00a0to measure gas mileage and\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.glympse.com/what-is-glympse\">Glympse</a>\u00a0for GPS tracking.</p><p>IoT is turning the vehicle into a powerful hub, enabling developers, manufacturers and service providers to offer value-added services and effectively changing their relationship with customers.</p><p>Connected services strengthen the vehicle manufacturers\u2019 relationships with their customers and enhance brand loyalty \u2013 all while developing new and ongoing revenue streams throughout the life of the vehicle. Manufacturers can monitor customers\u2019 experiences in real-time and on the road, enhance product quality, and investigate potential post-sale opportunities. And in turn, service providers are encouraged to explore an open platform for the production of apps that bring innovation to drivers and their passengers.</p><p>Armed with the power of IoT, vehicle manufacturers are on the leading edge of evolving user experiences and new business models based on IoT services. It\u2019s no longer about a one-time product sale \u2013 it\u2019s about creating an ecosystem wherein they can deliver and monetize services on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The connected car industry\u2019s successes have been a guiding light for many other markets as we see businesses everywhere embrace the evolution from a product company to an IoT services company.</p>", "title": ["How Connected Cars Have Established A New Ecosystem Powered By IoT"], "author": ["Jahangir Mohammed"]},
{"date": ["2014-04-03"], "text": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://imgur.com/\">Imgur</a>, the image sharing service popular with Reddit users and a\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/video/best-bootstrapped-startup-imgur-crunchies-awards-2013/518118965/\">regular</a> <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/10/congratulations-crunchies-winners-kickstarter-wins-best-overall-startup/\">winner</a> of the \u201cbest bootstrapped startup\u201d award at the annual Crunchies event is no longer going it alone. Following acquisition rumors and courting by just about every VC firm in the Valley,\u00a0the\u00a0company is today announcing a $40 million investment from\u00a0Andreessen Horowitz. The round also included a smaller contribution from Reddit, the company says.</p><p>Along with the investment, Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s Lars Dalgaard\u00a0will join\u00a0Imgur\u2019s board.</p><p>The scrappy, San Francisco-based company had bootstrapped itself for five years to profitability, having grown in a large part thanks to adoption by the Reddit community, who often turn to the service to host their shared images or viral memes. Meanwhile, the company has been financially supporting itself via\u00a0a few different avenues, including donations, pro users accounts, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/10/imgur-expands-its-revenue-streams-with-latest-api-update-now-ready-for-commercial-use/\">enterprise image hosting</a> for customers like Yahoo and Stack Exchange, as well as advertisements.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-839349\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/rofoaks.png?w=364&amp;h=364\" alt=\"rofOaks\" width=\"364\" height=\"364\">However, the company claims that it\u2019s the latter which brings in most of its revenue today \u2013 a figure Imgur\u00a0declines to share, or even ballpark.</p><p>Given that the\u00a0company is growing and profitable \u2013 it reports over 130 million unique visitors per month \u2013\u00a0the question for Imgur is \u201cwhy raise now?\u201d And also, maybe, why Andreessen?</p><p>Explains Schaaf, \u201cover the course of the five years, we probably met with a dozen VCs and angel investors\u2026but we never really clicked,\u201d he says. The company was generating revenue, so it was never clear why they would need to team up with an outside firm, he tells us. \u201cBut once we sat down with\u00a0Andreessen Horowitz, from the very first meeting we were laughing, coming up with actual ideas on what to do with Imgur and where to take it \u2013 it was actually a productive first VC meeting, which is really unusual,\u201d Schaaf\u00a0adds.</p><p>Also of interest:\u00a0Andreessen Horowitz was the first VC that Imgur ever reached out to, and they only sat down with them\u00a0this\u00a0January to begin the discussions.</p><p>Another thing that Imgur liked about working with the firm, which also goes by a16z\u00a0referencing a computer science insider\u2019s<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quora.com/Why-is-Andreessen-Horowitzs-URL-a16z-com\"> joke</a>, was that it brought more than just its investment to the table.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got\u2026like 80 other people working for them, and those people are there just to help you,\u201d says Schaaf, speaking of the firm\u2019s model involving services for entrepreneurs. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a marketing department, a PR department, a department that can help you hire engineers, a department that can help you hire C-level or key hires,\u201d he says, ticking off the reasons Imgur was sold on a16z.</p><p>\u201cIt was my opinion that everybody else could just give you money,\u201d Schaaf continues. \u201cAndreessen Horowitz is not like that, we could have every single one of their partners around our conference table right now figuring out a problem. They all work together, and we\u2019re able to get help from any of them.\u201d</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-982635\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/imgur-photos.png?w=680&amp;h=481\" alt=\"imgur-photos\" width=\"680\" height=\"481\"></p><p>As for why now, Schaaf says it\u2019s because Imgur as a company has grown more ambitious over time. The team now\u00a0wants to focus on ramping up its product and improving the quality of its advertising. To date, Imgur has worked with a small handful of less than a dozen advertisers, including Rockstar Games (Grand Theft Auto), Paramount (Anchorman 2), USA (TV network), \u201cShark Tank,\u201d AMC <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/imgur-debuts-an-analytics-platform-for-pro-users-and-advertisers/\">and others</a> on campaigns which involve placing\u00a0a image-based ad on Imgur in the hopes of going viral. This January, the company also introduced more tools for these sorts of advertisers,<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/imgur-debuts-an-analytics-platform-for-pro-users-and-advertisers/\"> including analytics</a>. But the company knows it\u2019s not yet a \u201chousehold name.\u201d</p><p>In terms of the Imgur product itself, Imgur wants to make it easier for people to find not just the most popular images, as they can on the homepage today, but find those categories of photos that are most interesting to them. An update to Imgur due out in around a month will introduce this new content discovery feature, we\u2019re told.</p><p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-982638\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/screen-shot-2014-04-02-at-11-34-35-pm.png?w=356&amp;h=295\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-04-02 at 11.34.35 PM\" width=\"356\" height=\"295\">Meanwhile, on mobile, which today accounts for 30% or more of Imgur traffic, the goal is to offer a better experience that\u2019s optimized for people on the go, rather than what\u2019s currently closer\u00a0to a replicated desktop experience. These changes are further down the road, though. Today, the\u00a0company offers a iOS and Android app, as well as <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/16/imgur-brings-its-meme-generation-utility-to-iphone-with-new-memegen-app/\">a mobile meme generation tool</a>.</p><p>The additional funding will help across all these fronts, including both product and ads (more selective, quality ads, stresses Schaaf, not just <em>more</em> ads), as well as with hiring. Imgur expects to either double or triple its 13-person team over the next year.</p><p>In addition, the Reddit investment will finally formalize the already friendly relationship between the two sites, making them more symbiotic and maybe even more integrated in some way, though Schaaf declined to go into details as to what\u2019s ahead for the two, only saying that there\u2019s no promise of Imgur being Reddit\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d image host at this time.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-982641\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/3wdqxk8.png?w=356&amp;h=269\" alt=\"3wdqxk8\" width=\"356\" height=\"269\">Finally, asked to put to bed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/imgur-and-yahoo-acquisition-talks-2013-12\">the rumors of that Yahoo deal</a>\u00a0and going the VC route instead, Schaaf carefully replied, \u201cthose were just rumors,\u201d and \u201cwe just raised $40 million, I\u2019m pretty sure that Yahoo is out of the picture, if they were ever in the picture at all.\u201d</p><p>But, he insists that Imgur\u2019s goals remain the same, even if they\u2019re now thinking more seriously about scale. \u201cOur goal is to become a big, independent business,\u201d says Schaaf. \u201cMy pet peeve is people asking me what my exit strategy is\u2026we didn\u2019t start Imgur to just get rich and get out,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to conquer the internet in terms of self-expression and viral images.\u201d</p>", "title": ["After Five Years Of Bootstrapping, Imgur Raises $40 Million From Andreessen Horowitz & Reddit"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

{"date": ["2014-09-22"], "text": "<p>A few months ago, on-demand home services startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.handy.com\">Handy</a> opened up its first international office and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thenextweb.com/uk/2014/07/08/handybooks-cleaner-handyman-booking-service-now-available-london-priced-10-per-hour/\">launched services in London</a>. In an effort to quickly grow its business there, today the company is announcing it\u2019s acquired local competitor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mopp.com\">Mopp</a>, which also provides home cleaning services in select U.K. markets.</p><p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Handy co-founder and CEO Oisin Hanrahan characterized the acquisition as a multi-million dollar, all-stock transaction that will effectively serve to merge the two businesses in London.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the first strategic acquisition of its kind for Handy. In January, back when it was called Handybook, the company <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/15/handybook-sweeps-up-exec-for-under-10m-to-expand-west-coast-footprint/\">acquired San Francisco-based Exec</a> to gain additional market share in some cities where it didn\u2019t have as strong of a presence. Since it had previously focused primarily on the East Coast, adding Exec\u2019s service providers and customer based enabled it to quickly ramp up in a number of West Coast markets.</p><p>In the same way, its acquisition of Mopp is positioned as a way to establish stronger market share for its home services business in London. Just 18 months old, Mopp has seen its user base grow more than 900 percent in 2014, and it now processes more than 10,000 bookings per month.</p><p>Rather than compete against an already strong player in a new market, Handy decided to acquire and merge the two businesses in London. The 25-person Mopp team, including founders Pete Dowds and Tom Brooks, will remain on board and will actually take over operations of the combined business in the U.K.</p><p>\u201cWe saw these two guys and how talented they were,\u201d Hanrahan told me. \u201cWe thought, \u2018Let\u2019s figure out how to work with these guys rather than figuring out how to work against them.'\u201d</p><p>For Handy the big advantage to doing so was quickly adding liquidity in a relatively new market \u2014 i.e., getting a critical mass of cleaners and other service providers signed up to serve its customers. With the acquisition closed, service providers and customers who had used Mopp\u2019s system will be transitioned over to Handy\u2019s backend, and the Mopp website will be powered by Handy.</p><p>In addition to London, Mopp had also offered services in Manchester, Bristol, Birmingham, and Brighton. But Hanrahan says the primary focus of the combined company will be growing its business in the U.K.\u2019s capital. </p><p>For Handy, that follows its general strategy of trying to be the largest provider of on-demand services wherever it operates. After quickly expanding to 27 markets and growing bookings 60 percent month-over-month and growing 10 times its size since the beginning of the year, Handy is now focused on expanding its customer base and market share in each cities it serves.</p><p>\u201cFor the next six-to-nine months, I don\u2019t see us adding markets at any significant rate. We want to be the market leader in every market that we\u2019re in,\u201d Hanrahan said, noting that the company has added 14 markets this year. \u201cIt will take some time before we\u2019re operationally excellent in all of those markets.\u201d</p><p>The acquisition of Mopp follows a few other big announcements Handy has made over the last few weeks. The company went throguh a big corporate rebrand, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/16/handybook-rebrands-as-handy/\">changing its name from Handybook to Handy</a> last week. It also recently <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/11/handybook-cfo-jeff-pedersen/\">added new CFO Jeff Pedersen</a>, who had previously worked at major corporations like Amazon, Dell, and IBM.</p><p>Handy has raised a total of $49 million in funding since being founded in 2012, including a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/11/handybook-30m-revolution-growth/\">$30 million Series B round</a> led by Revolution Growth earlier in the summer. Other investors include General Catalyst, Highland Capital, David Tisch, and Bullhorn CEO Art Papas, among others.

The public market investment is as sophisticated as the private market investment.\u201d</p><p>In case you missed the run-up to Zendesk\u2019s offering, here are the brass tacks: Zendesk priced at $9 per share, in the middle of its expected (but lowered) range, bringing in\u00a0$100 million. According to Google finance, after its gains, its market cap is nearing the $1 billion mark. Revenue expanded from $38.28 million in 2012, to $72.04 million in 2013. Most importantly, the company\u2019s net loss declined from $24.15 million in 2012, to $21.83 million in 2013. So, as Zendesk\u00a0grew its top line from 2012 to 2013, its net loss decreased.</p><p>That\u2019s the key difference, looking at yearly data, between Zendesk and a few other companies \u2014 from a GAAP perspective \u2014 that are looking to go public.</p><p>Here\u2019s Box\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1372612/000119312514112417/d642425ds1.htm\">two most recent years</a>:</p><p><em>Fiscal year ending January 31st, 2013: </em></p><p><em>Fiscal year ending January 31st, 2014:\u00a0</em></p><p>And Good Technology\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1089196/000119312514198867/d520327ds1.htm\">most recent full calendar year periods</a>:</p><p><em>2012:</em></p><p><em>2013:</em></p><p>As you can see in both cases, their losses are expanding quickly, staying stubbornly over revenue in the case of Box, or in the case of Good, falling from a high to mid 70s percentage of revenue.</p><p>Box and Zendesk are SaaS plays, and the most quickly growing component of Good Technology\u2019s revenue is its \u201crecurring\u201d column, so they share much in common, even if each offers a different kind of enterprise-focused product.</p><p>There are two camps of people who look at the S-1s of SaaS companies: People who fret, and people who love the burn rate. A crop of non-GAAP financial metrics are useful to understand why normal accounting doesn\u2019t do a great job at showing off future growth, and profits, of companies that spend heavily to acquire customers, and then earn revenues off that customer in regular intervals for the future.</p><p>These methods compare\u00a0the cost to acquire a customer (CAC), with the average lifetime value of a customer (LTV). Conventional wisdom is that you want to have an average CAC that is no more than a third of your average customer LTV. Why? Because your CAC doesn\u2019t take into account a host of costs that you\u00a0will endure, and, of course, you want to have a net profit margin at some point.</p><p>How does this apply to the above? If you have up-front CAC costs, and LTV spread out over time, with a break-even period, of say,\u00a012 months, you burn heavily in the short-term to buy annual\u00a0recurring revenue (ARR) that will, provided your unit economics work out over the life of a customer, more than pay back those earlier expenses. So, in the case of Box, say, it\u2019s willing to pay heavily for ARR up front, because it will continue to enjoy the fruits of those losses for quarters to come.</p><p>It\u2019s a reasonable idea. Here\u2019s the sticking point: In Box\u2019s S-1, for example, here are the number of mentions of ARR, LTV, and CAC: 0, 0, 0. So, we\u2019re discussing abstract accounting principles,\u00a0with little in the way of handles to get our arms around Box\u2019s performance in this regard.</p><p>Returning to Zendesk, its sales and marketing costs rose 65% from 2012, to 2013, while its revenue expanded 88% in the same period. Sales and marketing is Zendesk\u2019s largest line-item cost, so this comparison, practically, allowed the company to reduce its net loss while quickly growing its top line.</p><p>While Zendesk\u2019s financial performance did improve on a GAAP basis from 2012 to 2013, in its updated S-1, Zendesk\u2019s first 2014 quarter showed a steeper loss than in its first 2013 quarter. Revenue grew from $13.91 million to $25.09 million on a year-over-year basis, while its net loss grew from $5.35 million to $10.20 million. Comparing single quarters is less compelling\u00a0than comparing full years, but it seems that Zendesk isn\u2019t afraid to pick up larger losses.</p><p>Speaking with Zendesk, the company seems to understand that a very careful approach to spending is the order of the day right now.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe\u2019re going to be prudent about spending our money,\u201d Svane said. That means no more acquisitions for now \u2014 even though the company noted in its<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463172/000119312514197968/d727136ds1a.htm\"> S-1</a> that it would be investing\u00a0\u201caggressively\u201d\u00a0in its growth. \u201cWe have had long and organic development. The opportunity to acquire Zopim out of Singapore was a little love affair that we had a hard time ignoring\u2026 but\u00a0</span>we\u2019re not in any acquisition considerations.\u201d</p><p>A wrinkle from Zendesk\u2019s S-1: \u201csubscriptions to our customer service platform and live chat software are shorter than most comparable SaaS companies.\u201d That could impact its expected CAC repayment periods, decreasing the short-term impact of its sales cycle, lowering its short-term net losses. A good thing? Not if shorter contracts lead to more customer churn at the expiration date, and thus less total gross profit per customer. But, again, we\u2019re speculating.</p><p>To sum up, Box and Good\u2019s financials look scary as heck from a GAAP perspective, while making more sense from a potential perspective. But in the case of Zendesk, it differs from its SaaS\u00a0brethren because it has delivered a full-year period of revenue growth with a smaller\u00a0recorded loss. That\u2019s compelling. Its wider Q1 2014 loss could be indicative of a change in strategy, but proving that you can lose less while growing is worth something.</p><p>The above may help explain why Zendesk\u2019s IPO has performed as well as it has, and why Box and Good may\u00a0have a harder time convincing investors that yearly nine-figure GAAP losses are reasonable investments in future cash flows.</p><p><small style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#a5a5a5;\">IMAGE BY FLICKR USER\u00a0<a>Antonio Morales Garc\u00eda</a>\u00a0UNDER\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">CC BY 2.0</a>\u00a0LICENSE (IMAGE HAS BEEN CROPPED)</small></p>", "title": ["Zendesk\u2019s Stellar IPO And The Current Tech IPO Climate"], "author": ["Alex Wilhelm", "Ingrid Lunden"]},

He was a visionary, and took Apple from a relatively low point to being one of the most successful companies in the history of the world. But trying to <em>be</em> him, or just like him, would be a vain endeavor.</p><p>An hilarious tipster brought to our attention that Jack Dorsey, a Twitter co-founder and Square founder and CEO, may be attempting the latter. In fact, the tipster was gracious enough to bundle up all the evidence in a cute little <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stevejobsspirit.tumblr.com/post/29544010983/thoughts-on-jack\">Tumblr</a>. </p><p>In 1987, Jobs was fired from Apple, from which he went on to work with NeXT and Pixar, later returning to be the CEO of Apple. But when he was asked to leave the company he had helped build, he told Playboy the following:</p><p>Dorsey suffered through a similar situation, wherein he was made chairman of Twitter but no longer an employee. He told Vanity Fair:</p><p>Steve Jobs was a part of many unprecedented changes. The iPod changed the music industry. The iPad changed the computing industry. The iPhone? The iPhone changed everything. </p><p>But Jack Dorsey is a pioneer in his own right. He built a massive social network that has changed the way news travels. He is totally disrupting the credit card industry. So it only makes sense that the two would have the same feelings on their accomplishments. But apparently, they also have the same exact wording to describe it. </p><p>Jobs in 2010 at the D8 Conference:</p><p>Dorsey speaking with Kara Swisher in May 2011:</p><p>In 2008, Jobs explained that part of what makes Apple so successful, moreso than other tech companies, is that they\u2019ve managed to turn such a huge profit on so few devices. He said to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0803/gallery.jobsqna.fortune/6.html\">CNN Money</a>:</p><p>In February of this year, Dorsey had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/168477686484836352\">this</a> to say in celebration of Square\u2019s 3rd anniversary:</p><p>\u201cSurprise and delight\u201d is an incredibly common phrase in the tech world. Companies are always looking to please customers. In fact, \u201cdelight\u201d is a word I hear a lot out of Microsoft executives. But lo and behold, it\u2019s yet another thing that Mr. Jobs and Mr. Dorsey have in common. </p><p>Jobs at a 2010 Apple press conference:</p><p>Dorsey in 2011:</p><p>Both Steve Jobs and Jack Dorsey have a fondness for The Beatles. Jobs even went so far as to use the iconic four-man band as an example of how to manage and be a part of a team:</p><p>Dorsey also makes The Beatles a regular part of his work life:</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/does-jack-dorsey-want-to-be-just-like-steve-jobs/screen-shot-2012-08-16-at-10-39-47-am/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-629534\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screen-shot-2012-08-16-at-10-39-47-am.png?w=602&amp;h=602\" alt=\"\" title=\"Screen shot 2012-08-16 at 10.39.47 AM\" width=\"602\" height=\"602\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-629534\"></a></p><p>As has been made perfectly clear, Apple is all about focus. Rather than releasing hundreds of products a year, the company spends months and years developing a single product, perfecting it as much as possible. In any production environment with these standards, timing becomes very important. Sometimes, you must simply \u201cput it on the shelf\u201d and return another day. </p><p>Not surprisingly, Dorsey feels the same way:</p><p>Our tipster has a whole page full of examples, so I encourage you to head over to the Tumblr <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://stevejobsspirit.tumblr.com/post/29544010983/thoughts-on-jack\">Steve Jobs Spirit</a> and check it out.

{"date": ["2013-02-15"], "text": "<p>For student jobseekers, in these challenging economic conditions, internships still rank as one of the best ways to prevent yourself from joining the growing ranks of the overeducated and underemployed. In fact, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/article/surveys-reveal-internships-are-precursors-to-landing-a-job-and-keeping-a-job-20130211-00188#.UR4JBVpATxE\">A recent study by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE)</a> found that interning in college not only increases your chance of landing a job, but actually keeping it, too.</p><p>The report reveals that 63 percent of paid interns received \u201cat least one job offer upon graduation\u201d in 2012, compared to the 36 percent of grads who had no internship experience. In turn, 75 percent of employees that were hired out of internships were retained after a year, compared to 60 percent for those who didn\u2019t.

But <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/facebook-phone/\">Facebook Home</a> lets you chat in an overlaid drop-down window as you use Google, Yelp, Maps or any other app, bringing the productivity of the desktop to the small screen. Home\u2019s cover feed and responsive design are nice, but you could call them <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/04/facebooks-phone-is-a-triumph-of-mediocrity/\">mediocre</a>. Chat multi-tasking, though, merges the communication and computing sides of the smartphone.</p><p>Innovation doesn\u2019t need to hit you over the head. It just has to solve a problem in a new way. Until now, a real hinderance to text messaging on mobile was context switching. You were either communicating with someone, or you were in another app. \u2018Or\u2019. Not \u2018And\u2019. What Android and iOS call \u201cmulti-tasking\u201d is really just more rapid switching. Even with pop-over notifications, you still had to leave one app and open another to respond. That moment you see your current activity fade to black and a messaging app ascend to replace it causes a mental break.</p><p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-793777\" alt=\"Facebook Chat Heads During Google Search\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/facebook-chat-heads-during-google-search.png?w=188&amp;h=352\" width=\"188\" height=\"352\">This context switching is unnatural and unhelpful. Often we are communicating <em>about</em> what we\u2019re computing \u2014 giving someone the answer to a question, making a joint decision, guiding someone to a destination, or discussing a piece of content found online. I\u2019ve definitely had to go back and forth multiple times in frustration between SMS or Facebook Messenger and other apps when I couldn\u2019t remember a set of directions or other complicated string of information I was trying to pass to a friend. The best option was to carry on a voice call over speakerphone as you navigate around the phone, and some connection types don\u2019t even support this.</p><p>Our desire to converse as we cruise around the digital world stems from pre-mobile behavior patterns. Humans have always been able to talk while doing something else at the same time. Since the days of IRC and (TechCrunch parent company) AOL\u2019s Instant Messenger, you could browse the web or use other apps with a chat window floating on top. We were led to believe there simply wasn\u2019t enough space on our little mobile screens to do this. Maybe on big phablets like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi69xfyf6C4\">Galaxy Note II</a> or full-size tablets like the iPad, but not a traditional-sized smartphone screen.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s designers weren\u2019t satisfied with that. They are obsessed with modeling mobile after how we conduct our lives in person. That\u2019s why they built \u201cread receipts\u201d into Messenger a year ago. They mimic the body language cues that tell us someone heard what we said At the time, I asked <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/04/facebook-messenger-read-receipts/\">Facebook Director Of Product Peter Deng</a> who oversees messaging about the philosophy behind alerting people when their messages are read by their recipients. He told me:</p><p>Chat multi-tasking in Home is the next step he was alluding to. When someone messages you, a little bubble with their face pops up over the top of whatever app you\u2019re using. A preview of the first dozen characters of the message splays out sideways from their head. What\u2019s special is that if you tap their face, rather than closing your current app and opening Facebook Messenger, the bubble scoots to the top of the screen and an overlaid message window drops down from it with part of your currently used app still visible. Tap their face again and the message window retracts, revealing what you were doing with no context lost. When I used it in the launch event\u2019s demo area, I was very impressed by how seamlessly it worked into typical mobile activity. Rather than being interruptive, chatting felt complementary to whatever I was doing.</p><p>This system brings us one step closer to bonafide simultaneous messaging and mobile activity. In my opinion, the only serious shortcoming is that you can\u2019t park the overlaid chat window on part of the screen and scroll around the exposed background app behind it. There isn\u2019t a ton of room for this on the HTC First screen and some standard Androids, but I still think it\u2019d be useful. Luckily the trend is growing screen sizes, so we\u2019ll likely have more space soon.</p><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-793778 alignleft\" alt=\"Chat Heads While Instagramming\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/chat-heads-while-instagramming.png?w=182&amp;h=355\" width=\"182\" height=\"355\">Everyone I showed the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/04/hands-on-with-the-htc-first-running-the-gesture-powered-facebook-home-video/\">Facebook Home hands-on video</a> to or described the homescreen replacement app to has fixated on chat multi-tasking, which Facebook has given the silly name of \u201cChat Heads\u201d. When I showed the Home video to a group of three decidedly non-techie 27-year-old women in Washington, DC, it was Chat Heads that surprised and elated them. It was met with calls of \u201cI want that\u201d and even one \u201cI want to buy that\u201d in regards to the HTC First running Home.</p><p>The feature is a true game-changer because I believe we\u2019ll see similar functionality emulated and improved upon in other apps and operating systems. I would be extremely surprised and disappointed if the next version of Apple\u2019s iMessage didn\u2019t have some kind of chat multi-tasking. The same goes for the Google\u2019s rumored <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.techmeme.com/130319/p11#a130319p11\">unified messaging system</a> that\u2019s supposed to launch at some point in the near future. Hopefully they\u2019ll offer true, simultaneous messaging and other app usage.</p><p>Until then, Chat Heads could be the feature that convinces people to download Facebook Home or buy an HTC First. The messaging space has gotten extraordinarily hot these last few years as companies realize just how long we spend texting, and how much valuable data about who we care about comes with it. Instant, asynchronous mobile messaging brought us the ability to communicate as we go about our offline days. That\u2019s why SMS got so popular. But as we increasingly live digitally within the infinite potential of our smartphones, we need messaging broken out of its silo.</p><p><em>Read more of our <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/facebook-phone/\">coverage and analysis</a> of the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/04/facebook-home-launch/\">Facebook Home Launch</a>.</em></p>", "title": ["Chat Multi-Tasking, Facebook Home\u2019s Game Changer, Could Rattle Apple And Google"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},

After they enter their initial search, Pinterest will show a slideable row of additional terms that can be tapped to refine a search. For example, a search of \u201cPlants\u201d will reveal suggestions like \u201cfor shade\u201d \u201cpotted\u201d and \u201ckeep mosquitos away\u201d.

Silbermann described how the Pinterest team picked the traditional categories available from the homescreen \u00a0somewhat haphazardly and there was a lot of debate about what to offer next. Custom Categories allow you to \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d (the theme of the press event), finding categories that match your taste no matter how obscure.</p><p>You can browse pins about the category, and slide through a slick row of suggestions of related categories that looks similar to the additional search suggestions from Guided Search.</p><p>While these updates aren\u2019t revolutionary, they could make Pinterest both more accessible to new users who don\u2019t know what to search for, and hardcore who are always looking for ways to spend more time combing the service for inspiration and delight.

The iPhone gaming startup with several hits on its hands was founded by Bart Decrem, who will join Disney as a senior VP.  COO Andrew Lacy is also joining Disney as a  senior VP.  Disney is very interested in social and mobile gaming, having recently invested in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/21/playdom-steamboat-bessemer-venture-round/\">Playdom\u2019s $33 million round</a>.</p><p>Tapulous is a hot iPhone gaming startup which has raised only <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/tapulous\">$1.8 million</a> from angel investors including Marc Benioff, Jeff Clavier, and Andy Bechtolsheim. Legendary Silicon Valley mentor and Stanford professor Rajeev Motwani, who <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2009/06/06/silicon-valley-grieves-over-rajeev-motwani/\">passed away last year</a>, was also an investor.   Its flagship game, <em>Tap Tap Revenge</em>, has numerous versions which have been downloaded millions of times.  The basic game, which lets players tap to the rhythm of songs with their fingers is free, but players must pay for new songs.  Its latest game is <em><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/02/tap-tap-revenge-ipad/\">Tap Tap Radiation</a></em> for the iPad.</p><p>Tapulous\u2019 music-oriented games appeal to a younger crowd in particular.  The company puts out versions of Tap Tap Revenge featuring the songs of specific artists such as Justin Bieber Revenge, Lady Gaga Revenge, Nickelback Revenge, and Nine Inch Nails Revenge. Its other mobile music, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/07/riddim-ribbon-tapulous/\">Riddim Ribbon</a> is also a hit.</p><p><a href=\"http://disney.go.com/disneyinteractivestudios/\">Disney Interactive Studios</a> sells a slew of video games built around Disney movies and characters such as Toy Story, Cars, and Hannah Montana.  Most of these games are for consoles like the Xbox, PS3, or GameBoy.  Buying Tapulous gets it into the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad gaming platform and gives it a strong presence in music-related games.</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: And here is the <a href=\"http://tapulous.com/blog/2010/07/tapping-on/\">Tapulous blog post</a> by Decrem confirming the deal.</p><p>He also notes that Tap Tap Revenge has been downloaded more than 35 million times and played 1 billion songs.  The price was not disclosed.</p><p><strong>Update 2</strong>:  I spoke with Decrem on the phone.

For now, he is focussing on keeping Tapulous humming, but he will influence mobile games across Disney Interactive\u2019s portfolio.  It also sounds like he is ready to hire in Palo Alto  \u201cWe really want to build a big footprint here in the Valley,\u201d he adds, noting that there is a lot of empty office space in the old Facebook headquarters.</p>", "title": ["Breaking: Tapulous Acquired By Disney"], "author": ["Erick Schonfeld"]},

That may soon change though, as a pair of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wmpoweruser.com/verizon-nokia-lumia-822-real-life-pictures-leak/\">newly leaked images</a> point to the existence of a Lumia 820 variant meant for Verizon\u2019s airwaves.</p><p>As you\u2019d expect, the device \u2014 which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wmpoweruser.com/verizon-nokia-lumia-822-real-life-pictures-leak/\">WMPowerUser</a>\u2019s tipster refers to as the Lumia 822 \u2014 reportedly packs the same WVGA display and 8-megapixel rear camera that its cousin the 820 does, and there\u2019s a strong chance that internals remain similarly unchanged. That tell-tale stamp on the 822\u2019s butt means the device is also meant to play nice with Verizon\u2019s 4G LTE network as well, though that\u2019s really not much of a surprise.</p><p>Nokia has clearly taken some liberties with regard to industrial design here, as the 822 appears to be a much rounder affair and the other 800 series Windows Phones the Finnish company has signed off on. Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t seem quite as thick as the downright brick-like Lumia 810 that T-Mobile recently laid claim to. It\u2019s also worth noting that the model number attached to the device seems like a peculiar choice for a Lumia, but it\u2019s not like Nokia doesn\u2019t throw the occasional numerical curveball.</p><p>Perhaps naturally, this is isn\u2019t the first time Verizon\u2019s Lumia has been spotted.

Of course, a render can only tell you so much. Hell, even with these new images to consider, a number of the Lumia 822\u2019s particulars still can\u2019t be discern with any real degree of certainty. For now we\u2019ll just have to wait until Verizon comes clean on this little guy\u2019s existence \u2014 or for some new leaks to blow everything wide open.</p>", "title": ["Nokia\u2019s Not-So-Shy Lumia 822 Caught On Camera Clad In Verizon Branding"], "author": ["Chris Velazco"]},

{"date": ["2012-03-22"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm\">Glassdoor</a> has taken a look at how Google and Facebook compare in the eyes of employees and job candidates, and has extracted a number of interesting data points related to CEO approval, benefits, perks and more. For background, Glassdoor is a jobs and career community where employees can anonymously rate companies and CEOs.</p><p>First, Glassdoor says that so far in 2012, Google has overtaken Facebook in employee satisfaction company ratings. In fact, this is the first time Google has overtaken Facebook in the past four years, says Glassdoor. In 2012, Google\u2019s company rating reached a 3.9, surpassing Facebook\u2019s 3.7 rating. From 2009 through 2011, Facebook received a higher company rating from its employees (2009: 4.4; 2010: 4.7; 2011: 4.2), than Google did from its employees (2009: 3.8; 2010: 3.7; 2011: 4.1).</p><p>For <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/13/facebook-google-apple-and-rackspace-rated-best-places-to-work-in-2012/\">2011\u2019s rankings</a>, Facebook ranked two spots higher on the list than Google, taking the third spot. Facebook actually slipped from the top spot in 2010 to number 3 on the 2011 list and Google had moved up to the fifth slot from number 30 on 2010\u2019s list. Ratings are based on at least 10 reviews per year per company and on a 5-point scale: 5=very satisfied, 3=OK, 1=very dissatisfied.</p><p>Glassdoor also reports that Google CEO and founder Larry Page is currently rating slightly higher than Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Google employees are giving Page a 94% approval (6% disapproval) rating, which is just a tad bit higher than what Mark Zuckerberg earned from his own employees, which is a 92% approval (8% disapproval) rating.</p><p>Among employees\u2019 company reviews on Glassdoor, a larger percentage of Google employees talk about the food as a \u2018Pro\u2019 of working at the company (Google: 29%, Facebook: 25%). When it comes to benefits, the breakdown is as follows: (Google: 21%, Facebook: 17%) and perks (Google: 21%, Facebook: 12%).</p><p>However, when it comes to a favorable opinion on salary and compensation, it is neck and neck (Google: 9%, Facebook: 10%). Specifically, Glassdoor says that long hours and work/life balance are the biggest downsides of working at Facebook. More Facebook employees mention long working hours as a \u2018Con\u2019 than Google employees (FB: 9%, Google: 3% of employees). However, more Google employees cite politics and stress as \u2018Cons\u2019 over Facebook employees.</p><p>It\u2019s still only March, so this is hardly an indicator of how things will stack up for Facebook and Google for 2012\u2019s overall ranking. But in light of the talent wars in Silicon Valley, especially amongst these two companies; it is interesting to see Google\u2019s employee satisfaction rising.

The idea is reminiscent of other startups like\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://apps.facebook.com/beknown/profile/import\">BeKnown</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.branchout.com/\">BranchOut</a>, the latter of which\u00a0raised a similarly priced <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/19/branchout-25-million-users-funding-series-c/\">Series C of $25 million in April</a>. Also competing in this space is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.identified.com/\">Identified</a>, which scores job seekers based on how in-demand they are. This startup, too, raised a good-sized <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/05/identified-series-b/\">$21 million Series B this June</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/31/with-40-of-traffic-from-outside-u-s-glassdoor-raises-20-million-series-d-to-expand-internationally/sample-member-home-page/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-687638\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sample-member-home-page.png?w=640&amp;h=682\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sample Member Home Page\" width=\"640\" height=\"682\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-687638\"></a></p><p>But the difference with Glassdoor\u2019s \u201cInside Connections\u201d is that the Facebook data is only used to augment Glassdoor\u2019s content, as opposed to being the key product. Generally, users don\u2019t just visit Glassdoor to find out who works where; they visit for the other content the site hosts, including\u00a0company reviews, ratings, salary reports, interview questions and reviews, job listings, and more.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve grown now to about 3 million pieces of content on 200,000 companies in the world. We have data from about 190 countries. And when we took all of that, and laid it on the social graph, it was really valuable for users,\u201d explains Glassdoor CEO\u00a0Robert Hohman. \u201cWe did a really good job prior to Facebook for telling you what you needed to know about a company\u2026but by connecting with Facebook, we could finally tell you <em>who</em> you should know at a company.\u201d</p><p>Hohman says that deeper integration with Facebook has been the focus over the course of 2012, but things really hit critical mass this summer. \u201cThe result is now we\u2019re seeing about one new user every two seconds join Glassdoor,\u201d he says. That\u2019s 600 percent year-on-year growth. Over\u00a0the past year, traffic to Glassdoor.com has grown 160 percent to more than 13 million monthly unique visitors. When new users are introduced to the service, they find it helpful, Hohman adds, and one in 10 users ends up leaving content on the site.</p><p>In addition to user growth, Glassdoor has also seen revenue growth of 175 percent over the past year, but Hohman declined to provide exact figures. The company sells various packages to its 800 employer partners, offering branding and analytics solutions, as well as a way to target users as potential job seekers. Because the site is a destination for job seekers who have the luxury of researching employers for fit, many employers want to advertise what it\u2019s like to work at their respective companies, as well as what benefits they offer, for example. They can also track how their brand is perceived in the community, what other companies job seekers looked at besides them, and how they rank against their competition, among other things. Plus, because 98 percent of Glassdoor users connect with Facebook, the site is also able to help employers target job seekers by matching up potential positions based on social profile data.</p><p>With the additional funding, Glassdoor will now grow its sales team and focus on international expansion. Forty percent of its audience comes from outside the U.S. \u2013 a notable figure, given that the site is English-only at present. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting to be 40 percent international at this point,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat is what happens when you start to be successful with Facebook \u2013 it rips you in the direction of international.\u201d\u00a0Mobile is also in its sights, Hohman tells us, and promises they\u2019ll have more announcements on that front soon.</p>", "title": ["With 40% Of Traffic From Outside The U.S., Glassdoor Raises $20M Series D To Expand Internationally"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

Barbara Diniz, 29, and Mariana Penazzo, 27, who met studying Economics at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.insper.edu.br/\">Insper</a> in S\u00e3o Paulo, launched the business last year with their own capital after respective careers working in finance.</p><p>\u201cThe point was to do something that was online and interested us,\u201d Penazzo told me on a Skype call from S\u00e3o Paulo with Diniz. Penazzo had left her job a year and a half earlier so she could tinker with new ideas, while Barbara was still doing equity research for an investment fund. \u201cWe always joke that I\u2019m the poor one and Barbara is the rich one,\u201d says Penazzo. \u201cI had to go to a wedding and said, \u2018Can I look at your dresses and borrow one?\u2019\u201d The next thought: Could they\u00a0rent them?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Neither woman had heard of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.renttherunway.com/rtr_home\">Rent the Runway</a>, which by then had amassed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rent-the-runway\">over $80 million </a>in venture capital, until they had lunch with Endeavor\u2019s Institutional Relations Director, Fernanda Antunes. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Calm down, do you want to open Rent the Runway in Brazil?\u2019\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1145398 \" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/barbara-almeida-e-mariana-penazzo.jpg?w=388&amp;h=584\" alt=\"Barbara Almeida e Mariana Penazzo\" width=\"388\" height=\"584\">The undisclosed Series A from Kaszek Ventures (Kaszek is reticent to share exact numbers) follows a seed investment of R$1 million [$320,000] in 2013 from Brazilian firm <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/a5-internet-investments\">A5 Internet Investments</a>. Kaszek\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/nicolas-berman\">Nicolas Berman</a> will join the board along with Penazzo, Diniz and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/paulo-humberg\">Paulo Humberg</a> of A5, and Brazilian fashion heavyweight Marcella Kanner and former President of Louis Vuitton Brazil <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/carlos-ferreirinha/11/625/98b\">Carlos Ferreirinha</a> are set to join the company as advisors.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The co-founders say the financing will primarily go towards growing the team and expanding the inventory, which currently sits at 2,500 pieces (Rent the Runway has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2014/08/26/the-secret-mojo-behind-rent-the-runways-rental-machine/\">over 65,000</a>). \u201cWe talked to the Rent the Runway girls early on,\u201d Diniz says. \u201cThey said the business is more capital intensive than people imagine, and it really is, because you are always buying new dresses. The business grows proportionate to the dresses.\u201d</p><p>\u00a0In addition to relying on a heavy investment in inventory, the rental model is a logistically demanding one, requiring partnerships for fulfillment, delivery and cleaning. \u201cLogistics in Brazil surprised us, and not in a positive way,\u201d says Penazzo. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same logistical capacity as the US, and had to organize ourselves around it in a lot of ways, including expanding the amount of time we allocate for the dress to arrive and come back. Logistics was our first big challenge.\u201d</p><p>Dress &amp; Go is currently over a thousand dresses per month, mostly by Brazilian designers, at a price point of R$150-R$800 [US$50-$260], and expects to close 2015 with sales in excess of $R8 million [US $2.55 million]. And while the price point may seem to peg Dress &amp; Go as a service exclusively designed for Brazil\u2019s elite, or \u201cA\u201d class, Diniz and Penazzo explain that renting is a more affordable option than purchasing for a socio-economic range of Brazilian women.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThe dry-cleaning fee alone is over R$100 [US$35] here,\u201d explains Penazzo, \u201cand we include that in the price of the rental, whether it\u2019s a dress for R$200 [US$70] or R$5,000 [US$1,600].\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIn the US you have a lot of outlets and incredible sales,\u201d Diniz adds. \u201cYou can get a great dress at a good price.\u201d That doesn\u2019t exist in Brazil, where foreign goods get hit with a hefty import fee that doubles the price on everything from Kind bars to imported cars.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Pair pent-up demand with what Diniz and Penazzo describe as \u201cthe best clients on the planet for renting brand dresses\u201d to understand the implications of the Rent the Runway model in Brazil.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cBrazilian women are party girls. We\u2019re vain, we lead the world with plastic surgery, we love to look good and make ourselves up, and rare are the women who will leave their house without putting at least some blush on,\u201d Diniz generalizes. \u201cAnother point \u2013 Brazilians love brands. We love buying fake Louis Vuitton, fake Chanel, because we love to show we have the brand. On the other hand, the majority of Brazilians don\u2019t have the acquisitive power to buy them, so renting is a way for them to be wearing the latest fashions at an accessible price. We are even shipping dresses to favelas.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Diniz and Penazzo say there are over one million weddings per year in Brazil. According to research they conducted for their business plan, the number of women who can pay R$350 [US$110] or more to purchase a dress in Brazil represents a market opportunity of over R$3 billion [$960 million] per year.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThere\u2019s weddings in the rest of the world, and there\u2019s weddings in Brazil,\u201d explains Penazzo. \u00a0\u201cBrazilians invest surreal amounts of money in their weddings. So we have a lot of events for women from the A and B, even C [working middle] classes, where instead of going to have a dress made, they can rent a super-stylish one for the same amount. We don\u2019t have the pretense to segment social clients. The big brands are the big point, but you can find more economic dresses by the same brands. Our dream is to not worry about social class.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Love Mondays: Love Your Job</strong></p><p>If Dress &amp; Go is improving access to fashion beyond one\u2019s purchasing power, Love Mondays, an employer review site dedicated to helping Brazilians forge their career paths, also has accessibility as a core value.</p><p>With anonymous employee reviews and salary disclosures of over 20,000 Brazilian companies, the company\u00a0is announcing an undisclosed seed round with Kaszek Ventures.</p><p>\u201cOur mission is to help professionals like you make good career decisions,\u201d says the Love Mondays, which receives over 650,000 visitors per month from Brazilians considering a jump or seeing how they stack up against their peers.\u00a0\u201cFeel free to share what you like or don\u2019t like about the company you work for, share your salary, and help other professionals negotiate fair remuneration.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1145405\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/love-mondays-team.jpg?w=680&amp;h=453\" alt=\"Love Mondays Team\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">While employer review sites are well-trodden for the TechCrunch audience, from TheFunded and Glassdoor to \u00a0new players like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/memo-app-lets-workers-vent-anonymously-1421805377\">Memo</a>, Love Mondays co-founder and CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/luciana-caletti\">Luciana Caletti</a> says it\u2019s a radical concept in Brazil.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMost people outside of Brazil don\u2019t realize that Brazil has a very hierarchical work culture,\u201d she tells me on a Skype call from S\u00e3o Paulo, referencing the Hofstede Power Index ranking Brazil above Japan in its belief that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://geert-hofstede.com/brazil.html\">hierarchy should be respected and inequalities amongst people are acceptable</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt\u2019s surprising for someone who looks at Brazilian culture from the outside and sees that it\u2019s very informal and relaxed, in terms of leisure time. But in corporate culture, people are much more careful with what they say and what they do in front of their workmates and bosses,\u201d Caletti says. \u201cI get calls from HR directors who tell me they aren\u2019t getting real feedback from their internal surveys and ask how we can get them to post to Love Mondays.\u201d</p><p>Caletti started Love Mondays in 2013 with co-founders <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://br.linkedin.com/in/davecurran1/en\">David Curran</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://br.linkedin.com/in/shaneog/en\">Shane O\u2019Grady</a> after a non-linear career trajectory that is atypical for Brazilians, but not uncommon for tech entrepreneurs.</p><p>A week after completing law school in Brazil, Caletti decided not to become a lawyer and moved to London.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to live abroad since I was fourteen,\u201d she explains in impeccable English, \u201cand worked as an English teacher on the side through school so I could travel abroad.\u201d</p><p>After odd jobs as a waitress, call center attendant, and sandwich vendor, she got a job with the Brazilian Consulate, helping Brazilian citizens who were in trouble in the UK. Then she moved into management consulting and traveled globally for four years before getting an MBA at Oxford and joining Johnson &amp; Johnson to lead new consumer product launches and slowly work her way out of grad school debt.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI was getting to a point of my career where I\u2019d have to give up too much,\u201d Caletti recalls, \u201cSo I thought, either now or I won\u2019t do it later.\u201d She jumped to a \u201ckind of investment fund\u201d in Dubai to run \u201ca kind of advertising startup\u201d, where she shot the first TV commercial in post-war Iraq. Then she was ready to move back to Brazil with Dave Curran, her fiance who she met at Oxford, and Shane O\u2019Grady, a longtime friend of Curran\u2019s and the company\u2019s CTO.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI noticed a huge difference from the Brazil I\u2019d left almost ten years ago,\u201d Caletti says. \u201cPeople were looking for a job that made them happy. In early 2004, unemployment was high, around 12%, and people who had a job that paid the bills at the end of the month considered themselves very lucky. Over the last ten years, the unemployment rate has fallen steadily, and with lower unemployment comes the choice of where to work. That\u2019s a huge shift.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The observation is not just anecdotal. Caletti cites a recent study by Robert Half International indicating Brazil had the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/noticias/no-brasil-turnover-cresce-o-dobro-da-media-mundial\">highest turnover rate in the world</a> in 2013, for all kinds of jobs from factory floors to corporate suites.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The trend has slowed in recent months with Brazil\u2019s economy on the brink of disaster, thanks to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-05/petrobras-now-262-billion-poorer-exposes-busted-brazil-dream\">corruption scandal</a>of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/04/04/how-much-of-brazils-economy-got-lost-in-petrobras-scandal/\">surreal proportions</a> with federally owned oil giant Petrobras. The turnover is shifting from employees hopping to bigger offers, to employers replacing poor performers, but that may be a momentary blip on the radar. A 2014 report by the Boston Consulting Group says Brazil\u2019s talent gap is only growing, and will reach <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/management_two_speed_economy_public_sector_global_workforce_crisis/\">over 40 million people by 2030</a> \u2014 prime conditions to support a cultural shift towards an employee\u2019s market. And LinkedIn has already taken root in Brazil, with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://idgnow.com.br/ti-corporativa/2015/02/09/linkedin-supera-marca-de-20-milhoes-de-usuarios-no-brasil/\">over 20 million</a> members. \u201cThat\u2019s great for us,\u201d Caletti says.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThat\u2019s where we saw the opportunity,\u201d Caletti explains. \u201cIf there\u2019s that demand for qualified professionals, who now have a choice of where to work, how do they make that choice?\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After initial funding from the three co-founders, R$200,000 [US$64,000] from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://startupbrasil.org.br/\">Startup Brasil</a>, a R$45 million [US$15 million] federal program to foment startup culture, and entry into the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aceleratech.com.br/\">Aceleratech</a> accelerator in S\u00e3o Paulo, the co-founders struck out for seed capital.\u00a0 While they spoke with Brazilian investors, they went the direction most Brazilian entrepreneurs we\u2019ve covered in TechCrunch have gone and took on foreign capital, closing an undisclosed seed round with Kaszek in Buenos Aires. Kaszek\u2019s Nicolas Berman will join Caletti and Curran on the board.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The seed capital will be spent towards growing the team and community, and then to explore monetization. A mobile launch in January doubled the site\u2019s traffic to 650,000 visitors per month.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The site closed out March with 160,000 reviews and salaries for over 20,000 companies in Brazil, with IT professionals leading the content seeding. Most of the growth is coming through social media or news stories citing data Love Mondays is aggregating on items like the biggest drivers for employee <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://exame.abril.com.br/carreira/noticias/o-mais-estraga-a-qualidade-de-vida-dos-profissionais\">satisfaction</a> (a good work environment) and\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://exame.abril.com.br/carreira/noticias/o-mais-estraga-a-qualidade-de-vida-dos-profissionais\">dissatisfaction</a> (a weak boss).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWe released a Happiest States report, which shows Brazil\u2019s southern states are happiest,\u201d Caletti explains. \u201cThat was inspired by Lulu, the app where women rate their dates. They did a map of the most popular man in each state.\u201d (Lulu was taken down voluntarily\u00a0in Brazil and expects to be back online soon.) Caletti also cites Glassdoor and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.themuse.com/t\">TheMuse</a> as inspirations.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As to the finer process of cultivating good community and honest content, Caletti tacks off some of the basics, like requiring users to register before they post, reviewing content before it goes live, and snooping around LinkedIn to check questionable posts to verify the poster\u2019s career history. To encourage people to post content as well as consume it, Love Mondays requires visitors to register and post their own review to access past the first page of content.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Plans to monetize are not far off. Caletti says they want to allow companies to attract talent through Love Mondays. \u201cPosting jobs, but more than that,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe want to get employees to tell the story of the company and build the brand, and enable companies to attract talent that way.\u201d As for the now-maligned Petrobras, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lovemondays.com.br/trabalhar-na-petrobras\">88%</a> of its 345 anonymous Love Mondays reviewers would recommend the company to a friend.</p>", "title": ["In Latest Deals Brazilian Investor Kaszek Ventures Doubles Down On Women Entrepreneurs"], "author": ["Julie Ruvolo"]},

So Grantoo lets college students earn grants to help pay for those costly tuitions and, in turn, requires them to donate between 10 and 100 percent of their winnings to a charity of their choice (which includes The Hunger Project, Partners In Health, Pencils of Promise, MAMA and Engineers Without Borders, to name a few).</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/avg_00.jpg\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/avg_00.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200\" alt=\"\" title=\"AVG_00\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-671986\"></a> Under this model, students win, as do charities. While the overall impact on the colossal student debt problem is minimal at this point, but with Grantoo\u2019s obvious no-brainer value for students, if it can encourage brands to continue signing by continuing to refine incentives, with scale that impact grows. And that\u2019s not to discount the importance of building games that don\u2019t suck. Without engaging gaming experiences, the heart-warming social good means little.</p><p>The other conspicuous value prop here, for brands, is that those sponsoring Grantoo\u2019s tournaments get to participate in the charitable giving as well, as the money they put up is exclusively dished out to college students. This gives them serious brownie points with students who themselves are a much coveted demographic for many brands and can be vocal supporters \u2014 online and on social networks, if not financially.</p><p>Traditionally, brands don\u2019t get much credit for the donations they make to academic scholarships and other charitable causes, say Grantoo\u2019s co-founders, so the startup is working to provide them with ample branding opportunities on its platform, allowing companies to customize the tournament interface to reflect their brand\u2019s ethos. To date, Grantoo has hosted tournaments sponsored by WePay, KRED, Grooveshark and AVG, and Sillam says that 10 Fortune 500 companies are currently in the pipeline to sponsor tournaments this year.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/grantoo_v2_campaign_0000_avg-tournaments.jpg\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/grantoo_v2_campaign_0000_avg-tournaments.jpg?w=640&amp;h=396\" alt=\"\" title=\"Grantoo_v2_Campaign_0000_AVG - Tournaments\" width=\"640\" height=\"396\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-671987\"></a></p><p>Because all of the sponsorship money is distributed to students, Grantoo uses its own advertising to cover operational costs, though it will likely have to construct another revenue stream if it plans to be around for the long haul. However, the co-founders did say they\u2019re planning to raise a larger, series A round this winter, and it\u2019s true that living at the intersection of student debt, unemployment, social gaming and the globalized workforce \u2014 some of the hottest topics of the day \u2014 could be a benefit to Grantoo. Especially if it can convince brands that it\u2019s offering a \u201cnew\u201d type of business model \u2014 sustainable charity that can help a company\u2019s bottom line.</p><p>At launch, Grantoo is offering one trivia game to start on its web platform, with two new, original mobile games coming out on iOS and Android in November. In the long run, the co-founders say that they want to offer a variety of games \u2014 eschewing those based on luck to instead focus on addicting quiz and word games \u2014 and to get to a point where they\u2019re hosting multiple tournaments per day. There\u2019s a long way to go, but so far, Grantoo seems to be on the right track.</p><p>Find <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://signup.grantoo.org/\">Grantoo at home here. </a></p>", "title": ["Grantoo Nabs $1.7M, Steals EA Canada CTO To Help Students Pay Tuition By Playing Social Games"], "author": ["Rip Empson"]},

Users have also created more than 750 million boards in that time. (<strong>Update:</strong> Our initial story said 30 million, not 30 billion. Big difference.)</p><p>That growth has stemmed, in part, from the introduction of Related Pins, something the company released about a year ago. Nowadays more than 90 percent of Pins have Related Pins connected to them, and the number of people who repin Related Pins has grown by 20 percent.</p><p>Silbermann compared Pinterest to curation that already exists elsewhere in the world. Specifically, how collections on Pinterest are like curated art in museums, articles and photos in magazines, and collections of clothing at a retail location.</p><p>As Pinterest has grown up, it\u2019s sought to provide a lot more information about the things its users are Pinning.

In the official blog post, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick expressed optimism that the TLC would enable UberTAXI to return to NYC streets sometime next year, and cited Boston and Toronto as markets where the service was still available.

{"date": ["2010-02-07"], "text": "<p><img class=\"shot2\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/riddimshot.png\" alt=\"\">Back in July 2008, <a href=\"http://www.tapulous.com\">Tapulous</a> released a music game for the iPhone called Tap Tap Revenge (TTR).  The game proved to be a massive hit, growing to <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/31/tap-tap-revenge-approaches-1-million-users-music-industry-takes-notice/\">1 million</a> users within its first few weeks. \u00a0Over the last year and a half, TTR and its sequels have become the most popular series on the App Store, with over 25 million installs.  And tonight, Tapulous is ready to release an entirely new music-focused gaming series: <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/riddim-ribbon-feat-the-black/id350897007?mt=8\">Riddim Ribbon</a> (iTunes link), featuring the Black Eyed Peas.</p><p>Riddim Ribbon is a fusion between racing, popular songs, and to some extent, remixing music.  After choosing a song, the game throws you into a hyper-colorful racetrack, where you pilot a futuristic spherical vehicle. The track is filled with small orbs (which are good) and obstacles (which are not), and there\u2019s a path showing you where you should be driving.  To control your vehicle, you tilt your iPhone from side to side.  Most of this is standard fare for racing games, but Riddim Ribbon comes with a twist: you actually can modify the music you\u2019re listening to during the race depending on how you navigate the course.</p><p>It\u2019s easier than it sounds.  At multiple points in each track, you\u2019ll find yourself at a crossroads, where each route will play a different segment of the song you\u2019re listening to.  So, for example, in the track for \u2018Boom Boom Pow\u2019, there\u2019s a point midway through the track where you can choose to listen to either remixes by DJ Will.I.Am or Zuper Blahq (they sound different, but they\u2019re still the same song).  In effect, with every race you\u2019re stitching together multiple song segments to create your own custom mashup.  Of course, if you happen to leave the track for more than a second, the music starts to become scratchy and slowed down (it returns to normal once you steer back to the track).</p><p>This initial version of the game features three songs by the Black Eyed Peas for $2.99, with additional levels available for a dollar each (including a section for content by other artists). CEO Bart Decrem\u00a0says that this game was actually inspired by a conversation he had with will.i.am, who has been involved in the development of the game. \u00a0And while Decrem declined to comment on any specific future versions, Tapulous will almost certainly be releasing followups, including a generic Riddim Ribbon game (where most of the content is obtained through in-app purchases). Future releases will also include more features, including multiplayer support and more social functionality.</p><p>You can expect Riddim Ribbon to be at the top of the App Store\u2019s bestseller lists very soon, and not just because the game is fun.  Tapulous will be able to to cross-promote the new application through its install base of 25 million Tap Tap Revenge users, which Decrem says is the largest distribution channel on the entire App Store.</p><p>Decrem is very optimistic about the game\u2019s ability to monetize through the App Store\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/15/apple-announces-in-app-purchases-for-free-iphone-applications/\">in-app purchases</a>, which allow developers to upsell new virtual goods, songs, and features after a user has installed an application.  Decrem says that in-app downloads have become the biggest revenue stream for Tapulous (as opposed to selling premium apps), and that the company has noticed a big uptick in in-app purchases since the holiday season.</p><p>Also see the Zune HD game <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reZLsJAzO1c&amp;feature=related\">Audio Surf</a>, which has a lot of similarities to Riddim Ribbon.</p>", "title": ["With One Huge Hit Under Its Belt, Tapulous Debuts Another Music Game Series: Riddim Ribbon"], "author": ["Jason Kincaid"]},

In fact, the landlords, property managers and brokers who are looking for ideal candidates can clear through the clutter by listing on Zumper.</p><p>Zumper CEO Anthemos Georgiades says the apartment rental process is ripe for the picking but that it won\u2019t happen overnight: \u201cThis will take years, not months, but we\u2019re committed to making this work and we\u2019re very excited by the early traction we\u2019re seeing.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zumper-disrupt12/screen-shot-2012-09-09-at-3-09-59-pm/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-645116\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-09-at-3-09-59-pm-e1347229082344.png?w=640&amp;h=320\" alt=\"\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-09-09 at 3.09.59 PM\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-645116\" height=\"320\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p>So why would anyone want to use Zumper? For starters, it\u2019s free to use and list. Apartment hunters simply need to enter a few parameters (price, neighborhood, etc.) and you\u2019re then shown a flurry of listings that are plotted on top of Google Maps. If more than one unit is available in any given area, they\u2019re clustered together and denoted with the number of units available. Otherwise, you\u2019ll just see the price for a unit. All apartments listed are no more than five days old or as fresh as an hour old. Listings also include a bevy of photos, descriptions for both the unit and neighborhood, along with stats like the number of baths, sq. footage, etc.</p><p>You can favorite neighborhoods, for instance, for a customized news feed that\u2019s refreshed every five minutes. Each neighborhood page lists the number of types of units available (studios, 1 bedroom, etc.) so you can skim at your convenience. You can also favorite individual listings to keep tabs on potential new dwellings.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zumper-disrupt12/screen-shot-2012-09-09-at-3-10-08-pm/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-645118\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-09-at-3-10-08-pm-e1347229223507.png?w=640&amp;h=366\" alt=\"\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-09-09 at 3.10.08 PM\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-645118\" height=\"366\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p>To inquire about an apartment, you can contact the appropriate party through Zumper\u2019s messaging system instead of a random email address the way you do through Craigslist.</p><p>Zumper\u2019s listings are up to date and carefully curated to avoid all the noise (read: spam) found elsewhere online. The listings are not scraped either, which is great for all parties involved. The San Francisco-based startup will generate revenue through promoted listings and aggregate sales data of both listed and closing prices for trend forecasting and the like. A mobile app is expected in the next year.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/zumper-disrupt12/screen-shot-2012-09-09-at-3-16-52-pm/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-645119\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-09-at-3-16-52-pm.png?w=640&amp;h=408\" alt=\"\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-09-09 at 3.16.52 PM\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-645119\" height=\"408\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p>Zumper\u2019s team is comprised of Georgiades who comes from a real estate family; Taylor Glass-Moore, the COO, a native of San Francisco and real estate broker for over seven years; and Russell Middleton and Leah Jones, Zumper\u2019s technical co-founders, who were previously at Google as full-stack engineers.</p><p>When asked about the name, Georgiades had this to say: \u201cThe name came from a play on a British word \u2018<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazumping\">gazump</a>\u2018 which originally had negative connotations about house sellers dealing with multiple offers at the very last minute. We wanted to reinvent it to keep the positive aspects of live time data and offers and to combine it with a qualified rental inquiry platform. We want to empower tenants with as much data as possible to make the right decision in their apartment hunt.\u201d</p><p>If only I\u2019d known about Zumper earlier this year, I might not have re-signed the lease on my place for another two years!</p>", "title": [], "author": []},

For the full-year period that ended January\u00a02014, Box\u2019s revenues grew to\u00a0$124 million, up from\u00a0$58.8 million the year prior.</p><p>However, the company\u2019s net loss also expanded in the period, with Box posting losses of $168 million for the full-year period that ended January 2014, more than its total top line for the period.

It\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zendesk.com/blog/welcome-zopim\">made its first acquisition</a> \u2014 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zopim.com\">Zopim</a>, a Singapore-based startup whose flagship product is live chat software that is used by some 120,000 websites in 140 countries. And it has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463172/000119312514137878/d665368ds1.htm\">filed for its IPO</a>, which will see Zendesk list on the New York Stock Exchange to trade under the ticker \u201cZEN.\u201d The S-1 filing notes that Zendesk plans to raise $150 million.</p><p>Zendesk doesn\u2019t disclose the financial details of the Zopim acquisition in its press release, but it does in its SEC filing. According to the S-1, the Zopim deal is\u00a0worth up to $29.8 million. </p><p>The first part of that is the upfront payment of $15.9 million, with $5 million in cash and $10.9 million in common stock, with $1.1 million of the cash and $2.4 million of the common stock consideration \u201cheld back between 12 and 18 months as partial security for standard indemnification obligations and which is payable in the future under terms specified in the stock purchase agreement.\u201d The second part is an additional earn-out of up to $13.9 million in cash and equity \u201cover two and three years, respectively, to Zopim employees in connection with their continued employment.\u201d</p><p>Prior to today, Zopim had raised <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/zopim\">less than $400,000</a> since being founded back in 2008. (In comparison, Zendesk has raised some $85.5 million with investors including Christoph Janz, Charles River Ventures, Benchmark Capital, Matrix Partners, Redpoint Ventures, GGV Capital, Goldman Sachs, Index Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank.)</p><p>The IPO filing notes that Zendesk, which has 40,000 businesses as customers, made $72 million in revenues in 2013, growing 88% over 2012. It also posted net losses of $24.4 million and $22.6 million, in 2012 and 2013, respectively. (More on the IPO filing <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/10/zendesk-ipo-bears-striking-similarities-to-box/\">here</a> from Ron.)</p><p>As a result of the Zopim acquisition, Zendesk will be phasing out its own chat software and integrating Zopim\u2019s \u201csuperior\u201d one into its platform, writes\u00a0Adrian McDermott, SVP of product development, in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zendesk.com/blog/welcome-zopim\">blog post</a> announcing the news. But at the same time, Zopim will also continue to be sold as both a free and paid product, as it is today, the company noted in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zendesk.com/company/press/zendesk-acquires-live-chat-leader-zopim\">press release</a> about the news.</p><p>In fact some of that integration may have already started; the S-1 notes that the deal was actually, quietly completed in March of this year.</p><p>\u201cReal-time chat has become the foundation for how customers want to communicate online today. It is convenient for customers and makes companies more approachable to more people,\u201d said Mikkel Svane, founder and CEO of Zendesk, in a statement. \u201cZopim has a proven track record of providing tools for proactive engagement. Most importantly, the Zopim team shares our belief in building products that are beautifully simple and easy for any company to use.\u201d</p><p>Zopim is based in Singapore, and its entire team is joining Zendesk, with Zopim becoming a Singapore-based subsidiary of Zendesk. This gives the San Francisco-based company a bolted-on extension into Asia, as Zendesk notes in its S-1 that the team will remain there. One of its primary functions, Zendesk notes, will be as an R&amp;D center for the live chat operations. Currently some 41% of Zendesk\u2019s customers come from outside the U.S.</p><p>The other side of the Zopim is that it gives Zendesk a product that is already widely used across hundreds of thousands of websites, representing an opportunity to sell those websites other Zendesk services if they do not use them already. It also, of course, gives Zendesk another product that it will be able to upsell existing customers with.</p><p>\u201cWe acquired Zopim to accelerate our chat functionality and to bring our users a beautifully simple product they can use to engage their customers in real-time,\u201d writes McDermott. \u201cZopim has a great track record of providing tools for proactive customer experiences to customers worldwide. They offer both free and paid plans for customers, and have focused on making their product intuitive, transparent, and fun.\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s not an all-fun backstory for Zopim.</p><p>Zendesk notes two issues Zopim had prior to Zendesk\u2019s acquisition. The first had to do with a data breach:</p><p>(Zendesk, if you recall, faced its own security breach in 2013, affecting <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/21/zendesk-hacking-affects-tumblr-pinterest-and-twitter-customers/\">several high profile customers</a>.)</p><p>The second is that Zopim had, in the past, traded in Iran and made other violations of U.S. export control and sanctions laws, which it had already filed disclosures for on March 18 (presumably the day or just before the Zendesk deal closed):</p><p>Zendesk is clear that it might face violations itself if the U.S. government doesn\u2019t accept Zopim\u2019s disclosures of these activities:</p>", "title": ["Zendesk Buys Live Chat Provider Zopim For Up To $29.8M As It Files For $150M IPO"], "author": ["Ingrid Lunden"]},
{"date": ["2012-08-28"], "text": "<p>How many iOS charger cables do you own? You know, the 30-pin connector that\u2019s been packaged alongside every iPod, iPhone and iPad for as long as I can remember. Personally, I own seven. Each of my friends and colleagues has (at the very least) more than one of these wires. Essentially, if you\u2019ve owned an iThing for more than a few months, especially an iPhone, you probably own more than one cable, too.</p><p>But the next-gen iPhone, and its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/22/this-is-most-probably-the-new-iphone-cable/\">8-pin mini port</a>, will change more than the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/29/think-of-the-docks-could-the-new-iphone-have-a-microusb-connector/\">iThing accessories industry</a>. Sure, there are millions of docks, charging cases, etc. that will have trouble with this transition. But Apple will no doubt sell a connector for backwards compatibility, probably for around $30. This will cause some confusion with people less well-versed in technology, and it will probably take a couple years to get back to cable/dock ubiquity.</p><p>Remember the shift from serial ports to USB ports in computers? That mess took more than a decade to get settled, and PCs shipped with serial ports for a few years after USB was implemented as an industry standard. It\u2019ll be a long road ahead.</p><p>But the real issue isn\u2019t the accessories ecosystem, it\u2019s the ubiquity of the current iCable model.</p><p>Think of it this way. Last we heard, Apple had sold <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/confidential-apple-samsung-sales-figures-outed-in-court-filing-7000002447/\">167 million iDevices</a> in the U.S., including the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. For the record, that\u2019s about half of the U.S. population. Globally, the company has sold over <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/11/apple-wwdc2012-iphones-ipads-sold/\">365 million iThings</a>. And those are just devices. Now consider the fact that most of those iDevice owners have multiple cables, and that many of them are repeat customers, meaning they have one for each iThing they\u2019ve purchased.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/iphonecable.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/iphonecable.jpeg?w=640&amp;h=360\" alt=\"\" title=\"iphonecable\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-636548\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p>That is <em>a lot</em> of charging cables. And the kicker is that we\u2019ve grown accustomed to this lifestyle. Forgot your charger? No worries. Your friend has one at his house, or your mom has one in her car. Hell, the waitress at the restaurant probably has one.</p><p>The other night, I was at dinner with a few friends. One of them reached for his phone, held it out to the waitress, and asked that she plug it in. It wasn\u2019t attached to a charger, but it was an iPhone. To my surprise, she took the phone and plugged it in near the kitchen \u2014 an iPhone charger was already ready and waiting for a device to charge.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/iphonecable2.png\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/iphonecable2.png?w=197&amp;h=287\" alt=\"\" title=\"iphonecable2\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-636590\" height=\"287\" width=\"197\"></a>When the new iPhone launches, there will probably be millions of new iPhone owners in the U.S. within the first few weeks. But for each owner, there will be only one cable. Granted, that little white block that plugs into the wall with a USB port will still work with your new cable, but all your old cables instantly become useless with the new iPhone.</p><p>Losing your new 8-pin cable is out of the question, unless you\u2019re clever enough to stock up on <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/21/iphone-5-launch-date/\">iPhone day</a>. Proud fanbois will need to undergo a pretty major adjustment in their mindset, being ever-mindful of their bat-life situation, and remembering to bring a charger with them everywhere.</p><p>Remember, the iPhone 4S had some <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/31/iphone-4s-battery-life-bugs-got-you-down-try-this/\">pretty nasty battery life issues</a>, so it\u2019s just plain foolish to think the next iPhone will be any better. In fact, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/10/iphone-5-battery-images-leak-only-slighter-larger-than-iphone-4s-battery-despite-expected-lte/\">we\u2019ve learned</a> that the iPhone 5 will only get a 10mAh boost from the iPhone 4S battery, at 1440mAh. That\u2019s less than half of the 3300mAh battery in the Droid Razr Maxx, the current heavyweight champion of smartphone batteries.</p><p>Then let\u2019s weigh in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/11/apple-announces-ios-6-wwdc/\">new Siri capabilities</a> \u2014 hopefully the personal assistant will actually be useful, and thus used, this time around. Add to that a 4G LTE radio, which will most certainly be present in the next iPhone, along with more energy efficient tech like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/27/here-comes-passbook-latest-leak-points-to-nfc-equipped-next-gen-iphone/\">NFC</a> and Bluetooth 4, and what are you left with? Really shitty battery life.</p><p>But when you\u2019re out in the world, having dinner at a friend\u2019s house, that familiar little white wire probably won\u2019t be there for you anymore. You didn\u2019t think to bring your own cable because you rarely ever had to. And while all your friends are tweeting, Instagramming, and being generally merry, you\u2019ll be staring into your brand new iPhone watching that spinning wheel of death expel the final breaths from your precious.</p><p>It sounds like a first world problem. And it is. But I can assure you of this: A month after the iPhone launches, once battery life really begins to wear on people, the number of new iPhone owners will be far greater than one percent.</p>", "title": ["Winter Is Coming: The Great iPhone Cable Shortage Of 2012"], "author": ["Jordan Crook"]},

Perhaps the most major in a while, definitely as far as we can remember. Venture money that a year ago was going into consumer deals <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2013/01/18/startups-face-tighter-market-for-venture-capital-fuel/\">is now flowing into</a> enterprise, as the Series A crunch and reticence about Facebook\u2019s lackluster IPO has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324731304578193631342612220.html\">dampened investor enthusiasm</a>\u00a0for photosharing apps and their ilk.</p><p>In contrast to Facebook, a series of stellar enterprise IPOs like\u00a0Palo Alto Networks, Splunk and (perhaps the original enterprise cool kid) Workday have fired the collective entrepreneurial\u00a0imagination. \u201cWe see entrepreneurs come in every other day telling us how they\u2019re going to reinvent Splunk,\u201d Sequoia\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/aaref-hilaly\">Aaref Hilaly</a> tells me. \u201cThe successful enterprise IPOs serve as beacons for the companies that come after them.\u201d</p><p>Although the VC profits baseline has traditionally come from enterprise deals, they certainly weren\u2019t media darlings. Consumer startups, despite their high beta and tendency to be outliers, were the belle of the mainstream tech blog ball. \u201cConsumer technology tends to create fewer winners. Its easier to keep track of what a Facebook or a Twitter may be doing than myriad enterprise software vendors,\u201d NetSuite CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/zach-nelson\">Zach Nelson</a> notes. \u201c[There it] may take decades to decide the actual winners.\u201d</p><p>But the hype <em>is</em> changing. Conversations about \u201cthe next Instagram\u201d at Coupa, The Creamery or on Caltrain have been replaced with staid assessments about the future of Big Data, storage and the cloud. The mobile, social, local gold rush of 2011 has been put on pause, at least as far as consumer Internet is concerned. VCs are\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/16/vmware-cto-steve-harrod-joins-general-catalyst-to-boost-enterprise-investments/\">staffing up</a> with enterprise experts to handle the sharp shift in focus. We\u2019ve even heard someone was working on something described only as, \u201ca Path for enterprise.\u201d<strong><br></strong></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/fb-vs-wday-vs-panw.jpg\"><br><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-745113\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/fb-vs-wday-vs-panw.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=384\" alt=\"fb-vs-wday-vs-panw\" width=\"1024\" height=\"384\"></a></p><p>While the phenomenon is recent enough that the exact flow of investment dollars from consumer to enterprise has yet to be captured in a study, the data points are beginning to pop up. For example 2012 was the\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/firstround/status/294885296821125120\">first year in First Round Capital\u2019s history</a> in which consumer companies were less than 50 percent of investment dollars, according to a report it published this week. Expect to see many more of these sorts of reports. And more enterprise coverage on TechCrunch.</p><p>Enterprise startups are finally the cool kids. Nay, sexy.</p><p>\u201cI would say the market is schizophrenic,\u201d says Marc Andreessen, on why Workday &gt; Facebook might not mean the end of investor interest in social. \u201cRight now we are in an era where the market wants enterprise companies. I am just saying, \u2018Wait a year, that will flip again; wait another year after that, that will flip again.'\u201d</p><p>For now it\u2019s enterprise\u2019s time to shine. Due to the ubiquity of mobile computing, the cloud and the Bring Your Own Device movement, the lines are blurring between enterprise startups and consumer startups.\u00a0Is Google Apps an enterprise product? Is Dropbox? Is Evernote?\u00a0With an increasing proliferation of these sorts of <em>enterprisumer</em> startups, we\u2019re a far cry from the<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.computermuseum.li/Testpage/IBM-SAGE-computer.htm\"> IBM SAGE era</a>, where the only computing customers were literally big businesses.</p><p>In the past everything was top down. Large corporations and the government spent a lot of money on R&amp;D, and technologies developed in that R&amp;D like the mainframe/computer, the color TV and even the Internet would trickle down from large institutions to the mainstream user. Once these products hit the mainstream, the gravitational pull of the mainstream and its purchasing power slowly changed the adoption cycle from top down to bottom up.</p><p>\u201cConsumers can make buying decisions much more quickly than businesses can,\u201d Andreessen points, \u201cbecause for the consumer, they either like it or they don\u2019t, whereas businesses have to go through these long and involved processes.\u201d He maintains that the reason the enterprise wasn\u2019t particularly appealing for many entrepreneurs between 2000-2008 was that consumer software was the only software that anybody could adopt.\u201d This is no longer the case, as the enterprise world <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/05/02/benchmarks-peter-fenton-on-the-air-war-disrupting-the-enterprise-midas-list/\">evolves from a sales-driven to a product-driven</a> approach.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/screen-shot-2013-01-27-at-3-46-19-pm.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-745217 aligncenter\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/screen-shot-2013-01-27-at-3-46-19-pm.png?w=564&amp;h=354\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-01-27 at 3.46.19 PM\" width=\"564\" height=\"354\"></a></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/christian-gheorghe\">\u00a0</a></p><p>\u201cThe user is now the buyer, and the center of gravity is no longer in IT, it\u2019s actually in the line of business themselves,\u201d says <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/christian-gheorghe\">Christian Gheorghe</a>,\u00a0CEO of mobile first metrics management startup\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tidemark.com/\">Tidemark</a>, outlining the factors in that evolution. \u201cThe cloud is not just a cost-based improvement, but a new computational platform. And mobile is surpassing the desktop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demand for \u2018consumer-grade\u2019 enterprise technologies \u2014 from the\u00a0standpoint\u00a0of having strong UX, being mobile, and platform agnostic \u2014 is an\u00a0irreversible\u00a0trend,\u201d says Levie. \u201cTo the point that hard-to-use enterprise software will soon become more surprising than well-designed enterprise software (give it a few years).\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday all the consumerized enterprise stuff is as easily usable by the small business as it is by the large business,\u201d Andreessen explains. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s probably more easily usable by the small business than it is by the large business, because with a small business, it\u2019s like you can just use it. You don\u2019t have to go through a long process, you don\u2019t have to have a lot of meetings, you don\u2019t have to have committees, you don\u2019t have to have all this stuff. You can just start picking up and using it.\u201d</p><p>Because of this confluence of elements, an enterprise startup\u2019s \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy has become more complex than having a huge sales force or wining and dining the CIO. It actually boils down to making a product that people want to use, as consumers are already using cloud products, and fall back on them when their older enterprise solutions fail.</p><p>\u201cThe Exchange Server is down? No problem, I\u2019ll use Gmail. Email policy doesn\u2019t allow an attachment over 2 GB.

Those calls eventually turned into deals. In fact, one could argue that consumer startup Dropbox was the best thing to ever happened to Box, familiarizing the layman with cloud file sharing. Box then innovated on the use case, by offering increased security and controls to appease CIOs and enterprise execs.</p><p>\u201cThe first generation of this new enterprise wave was replacement technologies at lower prices (like Salesforce and SolarWinds),\u201d says Asana co-founder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/justin-rosenstein\">Justin Rosenstein,</a> \u201cbut the new wave is technologies that compete by being better products. The *new* inefficiency to compete against isn\u2019t just total cost of operations (through SaaS) or cost \u2013 it\u2019s beating them with a better product.\u201d</p><p>Because adoption is getting easier and other related factors, we\u2019re seeing an onslaught of entrepreneurs building products for businesses that employees actually can use or want to use. We\u2019re even seeing the emergence of companies like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.okta.com/\">Okta</a>, which are enterprise only, but still display the ease of a consumer startup.

As a user, you can log in to your company\u2019s admin page and access both private data hosted on your company\u2019s server (intranet) and data from cloud products like Box, Salesforce and Google Apps. Administrators can easily manage the credentials across various applications and devices.</p><p><strong>Competitors:</strong> Salesforce has just launched Salesforce Identity to compete directly with Okta.</p><p><strong>Secret sauce:</strong>\u00a0Okta is compatible with every web app you can think of. The startup has raised $52.5 million in\u00a0funding from Greylock Partners, Khosla Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, FLOODGATE and Sequoia.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cloudera.com/\">Cloudera</a> is the solution <em>de jour</em>\u00a0for managing big data in a company, offering software, services and support for databases. When a user needs to analyze raw data to find a trend or to see if they can find valuable answers in unused data, Cloudera (built on top of Hadoop) allows them to complete more efficient queries.</p><p><strong>Competitors:</strong> MapR\u00a0and Hortonworks, but they are much smaller. For big companies, they can ask for custom solutions from IBM, but it\u2019s a lot more expensive.</p><p><strong>Secret sauce:\u00a0</strong>Timing and it handles everything (software, development, support\u2026). Cloudera has big funding as well, having raised $141 million from\u00a0Greylock, Accel, Meritech Capital Partners, In-Q-Tel and others.</p><p>The original \u201csexy\u201d enterprise startup, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.box.com/\">Box</a>\u00a0allows you to store, manage and collaborate on your documents in the cloud. Founded back in 2006 (before Dropbox!), the company is helmed by the colorful Aaron Levie. Like Okta, Box\u2019s main advantage is that it integrates well with many enterprise apps and offers security in addition to collaboration functionality. Interoperability is crucial: Users can find their files uploaded to Box in their favorite CRM apps, etc.</p><p><strong>Competitors:</strong> Microsoft SharePoint, consumer products, Dropbox, Google Drive\u2026</p><p><strong>Secret sauce:</strong> It was there first! Box effectively competes by constantly iterating on its product, focusing on enterprise even when Dropbox caught on, and good partnerships. Box has thus far raised $284 million from Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Scale Venture Partners,\u00a0Andreessen Horowitz and others.</p><p>Developers need a place to track and share their code changes, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, with social coding features that make it really easy for open source projects, is the repository of choice. GitHub is so popular that its version control technology, Git, is replacing SVN based on merit. GitHub offers premium subscriptions and self-hosted versions, and many companies and startups have switched to private GitHub repositories, some very early (Spotify).</p><p><strong>Competitors:</strong> Google Code for the social coding aspect, self-hosted repositories on an Intranet.</p><p><strong>Secret sauce:</strong> Git. Git is such an ace technology that developers couldn\u2019t resist adopting it, and GitHub is *the* best way to use Git. The runner up in the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/31/crunchies-dropbox/\">Bootstrapped Startup</a> category at the 2011 Crunchies, GitHub eventually relented and took $100 million in Series A funding from Andreessen Horowitz last year.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zendesk.com/\">Zendesk</a> is user-friendly help desk software that allows companies to handle support requests in bulk. Zendesk is IPO-bound and, like enterprise pal Workday, might be another point of light in a series of lackluster tech IPOs.</p><p><strong>Competitors:</strong>\u00a0Tons of companies are building desk software, and there are many open source apps for small and medium companies. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://Desk.com/\">Desk.com</a> (formerly Assistly, acquired by Salesforce) and Tender Support are quite popular, but Tender Support doesn\u2019t have the same breadth of resources as Zendesk.</p><p><strong>Secret sauce:</strong>\u00a0Zendesk was the first modern help desk, but Desk.com is gaining a lot of traction with Salesforce behind it. The company has plenty of money in the bank, having raised $85.5 million from Charles River Ventures, Benchmark Capital, Matrix Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Index Ventures, GGV Capital, Goldman Sachs and Silicon Valley Bank.</p><p>Taking the lessons they learned from an early stint at Facebook, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://asana.com/\">Asana</a> co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Justin Rosenstein have built a beautiful and streamlined collaboration tool with a focus on to-do lists. The interface is flexible and easy to understand. In Asana, everything is a to-do item. The platform\u00a0doesn\u2019t try to do it all, but its design is very very intuitive, adhering humbly to its core goal of\u00a0easing communications within a team.</p><p><strong>Competitors:</strong> Basecamp from 37signals, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://Do.com/\">Do.com</a> from Salesforce, and other communication tools that may make it useless (think Yammer) and many small alternatives (Producteev, Flow, etc.). For all these companies, the closest competitor might be basic emails.</p><p><strong>Secret sauce:</strong>\u00a0The Asana product is relatively easy to use, and this is important for a latecomer to the collaboration software space. Pricing is friendly, too. For small companies, many of which have yet to switch to a collaboration tool, you can basically use it for free.

Its simplicity and \u201cout of the box\u201d integrations make it ideal for small and medium enterprises. GoodData has $53.5 million in funding from\u00a0Andreessen Horowitz,\u00a0General Catalyst Partners,\u00a0Tim O\u2019Reilly and others.</p><p>\u201cThe coolest thing to come out of Australia,\u201d according to Accel\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ping-li\">Ping Li</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.atlassian.com/\">Atlassian</a> is low-cost project management software. It provides a series of enterprise web apps: Jira is a project-tracking tool focused on software development; Confluence is a more traditional collaboration and communication tool; and developers use many of its other smaller product offerings in their workflows. Finally, Atlassian acquired HipChat, a hip chat app.</p><p><strong>Competitors:</strong> Open source project management solutions and native apps compete with Jira. Confluence competes with Basecamp, Yammer, etc. HipChat competes with Campfire from 37signals.</p><p><strong>Secret sauce:</strong> Founded in 2002, Atlassian is not a kid anymore. Over the years, it has proved to be a reliable web app developer. The company has thus far raised $60 million in Series A solely from Accel Partners.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nimblestorage.com/\">Nimble Storage</a> is a provider of flash-optimized hybrid storage solutions. It has found a way to provide a large storage capacity with 5x the performance and 5x the capacity as existing products from EMC and NetApp. Nimble Storage has a unique caching system based on the flash storage commonly found in PCs and mobile phones. The result is a great speed increase, comparable to putting an SSD drive in your old computer. That technology is patented for online data storage.</p><p><strong>Competitors:</strong> EMC, NetApp, Amazon S3 and other online storage solutions.</p><p><strong>Secret sauce:</strong> Improving read/write speeds is a great challenge for hosting solutions these days, and Nimble is faster than its competitors, yet costs the same. It has received $81.7 million in funding from Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and others.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mobileiron.com/\">MobileIron</a> is a device management tool for system admins. Now that the BYOD trend is taking over businesses, admins have to find new ways to handle security settings and push mobile apps to employees \u2014 all of this across multiple phones, tablets and operating systems. MobileIron provides a single platform to manage all devices even though most of them are personal devices that employees bring to the workplace.</p><p><strong>Competitors:</strong> In-house solutions and restrictions, checking security settings one phone at a time or choosing not to care about security.</p><p><strong>Secret sauce:</strong> MobileIron makes it much easier for system admins to handle custom phone settings. If you convert one system admin, the entire company will switch to MobileIron. Since 2007, it has raised $96.8 million from Sequoia Capital, Storm Ventures and Norwest Venture Partners.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/screen-shot-2013-01-27-at-3-49-18-pm.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-745219\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/screen-shot-2013-01-27-at-3-49-18-pm.png?w=1024&amp;h=333\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-01-27 at 3.49.18 PM\" width=\"1024\" height=\"333\"></a></p><p>\u201cThey are all basically new companies,\u201d says Andreessen, who agreed with many of the \u201cCool Kids\u201d choices. \u201cI think who is not on that list are all the existing companies that sell business software.\u201d And being younger, more agile companies automatically makes them much more interesting.

The advantage of the enterprise companies is that they have revenue numbers off the bat if they\u2019re good, and thus they are not as subject to consumer trends, fads or behavior, which is why investors, having raised less money to invest in 2013 in the first place, are being cautious.</p><p>\u201cFolks have realized that businesses buy close to $300 billion worth of software ($285 billion according to Gartner in 2012),\u201d says Rosenstein, \u201cand that companies who exhibit those attributes have the potential to build *very* large businesses. This is compounded by the opportunity to grow very quickly, since the economics of scaling a software business have been forever changed by things like Amazon on the backend, and self-service sales on the frontend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe businesses are good, which is nice,\u201d Andreessen adds, \u201cand then I think it\u2019s also sector rotation. We talk to a lot of the big hedge funds, mutual funds. It\u2019s really funny. We are talking about big hedge funds, mutual funds \u2014 about six months ago they all started saying, well, you know, we really think there is going to be a rotation from consumer and enterprise and we are going to really get ahead of that. And I am like, yeah, you and 10 other guys in the last two weeks have told me the same thing. It\u2019s like, good job, like you are way out ahead on the leading edge on this.\u201d</p><p>You have to give credit to the foresight of the Levies, Bhusris, Svanes of the world who took a bet on enterprise when it wasn\u2019t the new girl in school. And, especially, the Ellisons and Benioffs for building the school. In fact, there is a salacious rumor making the rounds that Levie actually has a picture of Ellison as his iPhone home screen. \u201cNo comment,\u201d he says.</p><p>As DFJ partner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/andreas-stavropoulos\">Andreas Stavropoulos</a> brings up, \u201cInterestingly, enterprise companies like Box that are gaining traction now were started in 2004-2007 when it wasn\u2019t cool to be enterprise-focused. This shows some of the best innovations happen when most of the market is looking the other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy running joke has been, it\u2019s like little kids,\u201d says Andreessen. \u201cLike everybody out of the consumer pool, everybody into the enterprise pool.

This is absolutely huge news for developers, and will likely lead to a fundamental shift in the way applications are marketed and priced. It\u2019s hard to overstate just how much this will change the App Store.</p><p>Up until now developers of premium applications have faced a major problem: they had no way to offer a feature-restricted version of an application for free that users could pay to unlock if they liked what they saw \u2014 a model that\u2019s quite common on desktop software. This led to the creation of the so-called \u2018Lite\u2019 versions of applications, which generally offer a reduced featureset, but require users to download an entirely new application to access more features, which obviously isn\u2019t ideal. Now, they won\u2019t face this hurdle. They\u2019ll be able to ditch the Lite version entirely, switch their currently premium app over to free (which will lead to more impulse downloads), and give users the chance to upgrade their featureset down the road.</p><p><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/inapppurchases.png\"></p><p>This will also have a massive impact on free games that thrive on the sales of virtual goods, like Tapulous and Zynga. Up until now Tapulous has been unable to sell new songs through its flagship applications Tap Tap Revenge 1 and 2, because these are both free. In order to take advantage of the in-app purchase feature that Apple launched earlier this summer, Tapulous was forced to launch TTR3 as a 99 cent application. The app has still done extremely well, leading the Top Grossing charts for days, but it would have almost certainly gotten even more downloads had it been free.</p><p>Likewise, games like Zynga\u2019s Mafia Wars and SGN\u2019s Mafia: Respect and Retaliation have had to offer Lite version of their games, not necessarily because they wanted to restrict features to users, but because they had to charge something so that users could purchase virtual goods down the line. It looks like Zynga and others won\u2019t be able to use virtual currency, which Apple has basically forbidden.  However, don\u2019t be surprised if they offer \u201cpacks\u201d of upgrades that you can buy.</p><p>There have been various rumors as to why Apple restricted in-app purchases in free games to begin with.  Some have speculated that Apple is concerned this will lead to many free apps that tempt users to download them and then do essentially nothing until you pay to unlock them, which is still a valid concern.  Others believe it has to do Apple\u2019s payment system, which may lack credit card information for users who only download free applications.</p><p>Here are some guidelines Apple is giving to developers for their integration of in-app purchases into free games:</p><p>-No virtual currency</p><p><b>Note:</b> This means that content owners won\u2019t be able to let their content expire.

(Something Facebook has fallen afoul of before \u2014 or at least had to take steps to adjust its modus operandi, by <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/21/facebook-turns-off-facial-recognition-in-the-eu-gets-the-all-clear-from-irelands-data-protection-commissioner-on-its-review/\">turning off facial recognition in the EU</a> this fall to help it through a privacy review conducted by Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner.)</p><p>The ULD goes on to demand that Facebook ceases to enforce the real-name policy in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, noting: \u201cTo ensure the data subjects\u2019 rights and data protection law in general, the real name obligation must be immediately abandoned by Facebook.\u201d</p><p>Thilo Weichert, Privacy Commissioner and Head of ULD said in a statement: \u201cIt is unacceptable that a U.S. portal like Facebook violates German data protection law unopposed and with no prospect of an end.\u201d</p><p>Facebook told TechCrunch it plans to \u201cvigorously\u201d fight the ULD\u2019s ruling. A spokesperson provided the following statement:\u00a0\u201cIt\u00a0is the role of individual services to determine their own policies about anonymity within the governing law \u2014 for Facebook Ireland European data protection and Irish law. We believe the orders are without merit,\u00a0a waste of German taxpayers\u2019 money\u00a0and we will fight it vigorously. \u201d</p><p>Ireland is a key battleground for Facebook in Europe because that\u2019s where its European headquarters are located, meaning it must be compliant with Irish data protection law \u2014 as well as wider European data protection law. But it remains to be seen whether Facebook can be forced to comply with German law.</p><p>Weichert\u2019s statement flags up the legal uncertainties the Commissioner is hoping to clarify, noting:\u00a0\u201cThe aim of the orders of ULD is to finally bring about a legal clarification of who is responsible for Facebook and to what this company is bound to.\u201d</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: Marit Hansen,\u00a0Commissioner Weichert\u2019s deputy, has explained what will happen next. \u201cThe next step is that Facebook has to officially answer our letter.\u00a0Either they confirm that they will act according to the law (as stated\u00a0in our letter), or they have to react by lodging an objection (written\u00a0statement to be sent to ULD) and to request suspensive effect at\u00a0Verwaltungsgericht (administrative court) Schleswig. This will be the\u00a0beginning of a regular lawsuit,\u201d he wrote in an email to TechCrunch.</p><p>For its part, Facebook will doubtless argue that mandating real names is an essential feature of its network, differentiating it from other types of social networks and providing increased security and certainty for its users. That\u2019s not to say everything that exists on Facebook today is 100% bona fide:\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/reality-check-10-15-of-social-media-fans-likes-and-reviews-will-be-fake-by-2014-says-gartner/\">fake Facebook fans and likes</a>\u00a0are a growing problem, while in August Facebook admitted there were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/02/facebook-83m-profiles-bogus-fake\">83 million fake profiles</a> on its network, including duplicate accounts and pages set up for pets.</p><p>The ULD\u2019s ruling follows below in full</p>", "title": ["Facebook Users Must Be Allowed To Use Pseudonyms, Says German Privacy Regulator; Real-Name Policy \u2018Erodes Online Freedoms\u2019"], "author": ["Natasha Lomas"]},

Silvio Berlusconi was outed as one of the key investors in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.square.com\">Square</a> clone <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.payleven.de\">Payleven</a>; and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zalando.com\">Zalando</a>, inspired by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zappos.com\">Zappos</a> in the U.S., is reporting 2012 net sales of \u20ac1.15 billion and reaching breakeven in its core markets of Germany, Austria and Switzerland.</p><p>The two items are significant because Rocket Internet \u2014 the German-based e-commerce incubator and investment vehicle from the Samwer brothers that has created a range of businesses effectively recreating ideas first developed elsewhere \u2014 is known for being somewhat oblique when it comes to giving out certain facts about its portfolio companies, whether it\u2019s the size of funding rounds, how many users they have, or who is backing them.</p><p>TechCrunch understands that Berlusconi and his family invest in Payleven through their B Cinque vehicle \u2014 \u201ccinque\u201d meaning five in Italian, and referring to his five children. Furthermore, this was the identity behind <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/20/payleven-the-samwers-answer-to-square-takes-a-high-single-digit-million-dollar-round-led-by-a-mysterious-new-investor/\">last month\u2019s news that Payleven had received an additional \u201chigh single digit million dollar\u201d investment</a> from a mystery backer, in addition to named backers New Enterprise Associates, Holtzbrinck Ventures, ru-Net and the Samwer brothers\u2019 Rocket Internet. That news was first published in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin-aktuell/startups/article113648911/Berlusconi-Familie-steigt-bei-Berliner-Start-up-ein.html\">German press</a> yesterday.</p><p>But TechCrunch also understands that B Cinque may be investing already or plans to invest in further Rocket enterprises: its \u20ac40 million investment fund was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.you-ng.it/news/politica-e-attualita/item/5105-famiglia-berlusconi-nasce-la-b-cinque.html\">first made public</a> in December 2012, and our source described it as a \u201cvery potent investor.\u201d</p><p>Berlusconi, in addition to having been prime minister of Italy three separate times, is also the controlling shareholder of Italian media giant Mediaset, as well as owner of the A.C. Milan football club. He has also been in court for tax evasion and in the press over alleged sex scandals.</p><p>Putting all that color aside, though, making an investment in Payleven could pave the way for the mobile payments company to make a move into Italy, and even strike deals for usage through one of Berlusconi\u2019s other operations (for example, selling goods at A.C. Milan games). Italy is a mobile-crazy country, and like other economies in southern Europe, it has a high concentration of small merchants who are not enabled to accept credit cards \u2014 meaning there is a natural audience there. One of Rocket\u2019s competitors, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/14/sumup-another-european-square-expands-to-italy-spain-and-holland-now-covering-7-countries-12-weeks-into-launch/\">SumUp, already offers services in Italy</a> as well as Spain.</p><p>Perhaps hoping to get Rocket\u2019s name out in a more positive light, today Rocket also put out some numbers on how Zalando, its online shoe/fashion site with some 150,000 styles from 1,500 brands, is doing. Given that Rocket doesn\u2019t generally release these kinds of numbers, it\u2019s worth taking a look:</p><p>Its net sales of \u20ac1.15 billion, Zalando says, are just over double what the company made a year ago (\u20ac510 million). Zalando claims that this makes it the first company in Europe to reach \u20ac1 billion in net sales annually within four years of opening for business. It also puts Zalando into breakeven (earnings before interest and taxes) in its core markets of Germany, Austria and Switzerland.</p><p>That growth works out to a rate of 125% over the last couple of years across the 14 markets where it operates, as you can see in this chart:</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-758875\" alt=\"zalando net sales 2010-2012\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-15-at-11-45-04.png?w=680&amp;h=172\"></p><p>\u201cBy launching shops in several new countries we have now established a broad footprint. This will be the basis for Zalando\u2019s growth for the years to come,\u201d Robert Gentz, Zalando MD and co-founder, said in a statement.</p><p>In addition to its three core markets, Zalando is also active in Netherlands, France, Italy, UK, Sweden, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, Finland, Poland and Norway. As with Rocket\u2019s most successful exits \u2014 most recently with its daily deals operation CityDeal going to Groupon \u2014 the operation continues to complement the work done by Zappos in the U.S., a fact that has not gone unnoticed by investors, who have pumped hundreds of millions into the operation.</p><p>Backers of Zalando include Yuri Milner\u2019s DST Global, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Quadrant Capital, and AB Kinnevik, which is the company\u2019s largest shareholder, in October taking a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kinnevik.se/en/Media/Pressmeddelanden/KINNEVIK-ACQUIRES-AN-ADDITIONAL-10-OF-ZALANDO/\">further 10% stake in the company for \u20ac287 million</a>.

{"date": ["2014-05-16"], "text": "<p>Venture capitalist Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures made waves recently\u00a0when he told TechCrunch\u2019s Ingrid Lunden that by 2020, (that\u2019s less than 6 years, folks),<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/05/vc-fred-wilson-in-20-years-apple-wont-be-a-top-3-tech-company-google-and-facebook-will/\">\u00a0Apple won\u2019t be a top-3 tech company</a>\u2013and Google and Facebook would be.</p><p>Wilson argued that Apple\u2019s lack of understanding of the cloud would eventually do it in, while Google and Facebook, which are inherently more cloud friendly, would survive. He left the door open for a third company we haven\u2019t heard of for the remaining top spot.</p><p>It\u2019s an interesting theory, but I\u2019m here to tell you that each of these companies has a profound weakness by which any one of them could be undone. It\u2019s also important to note that in spite of these weaknesses, each company is so wealthy that they can find ways to buy their way out of trouble for many years to come and maintain their market dominance through brute force, if not through innovation.</p><p>Let\u2019s start by looking at Apple. Wilson is spot-on, of course. In spite of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gigaom.com/2010/10/25/apples-new-north-carolina-data-center-ready-to-roll-2/\">opening an expensive data center in North Carolina</a> several years ago, it never really seemed to understand the cloud. There have been fits and starts, of course, with iCloud being the latest iteration in a line of failed attempts, but even as someone\u00a0who uses cloud products on a daily basis\u00a0and who writes about the industry, I find iCloud obtuse and difficult to understand. I\u2019ve talked to tech-savvy friends who have similar feelings.</p><p>For Microsoft, its big weakness is mobile. As hard as it has tried to make headway in the mobile space, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.computerworld.com/windows-phone/23904/windows-phone-stuck-3-world-market-share-time-call-android\">marketshare remains mired worldwide around 3 percent</a>. This after years of trying different ways to encourage more adoption. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/15/4433082/microsoft-paying-companies-100k-windows-phone-apps\">Microsoft has tried paying developers</a>. They have bought Nokia, their best brand, and nothing seems to work.</p><p>Up until recently, you could have said Facebook didn\u2019t get mobile either, and you would have been right, but they are adjusting and over the last several months, they\u2019ve done better. They have numbers in their favor of course in terms of users, but that user base is not fixed to them, and if they continue to abuse users around data and privacy issues, not to mention constant interface changes and a complete lack of transparency about data usage, their hold on that audience is not guaranteed.</p><p>Facebook is also a closed system meaning that beyond ads, that many of us ignore, it doesn\u2019t have meaningful linkage out to the open web. If I want to buy something, I\u2019m going to go to Amazon or other shopping site for that. If I want to watch a video, I\u2019m going to YouTube. If I want to make travel plans I\u2019m going to Kayak or Airbnb. Facebook is great for sharing stuff and asking what my friends like, but when I actually want to do something, I\u2019m leaving, and that could hurt\u00a0Facebook eventually.</p><p>Finally, we have Google which in spite of having its fingers in all kinds of pies, is ultimately a one-trick pony when it comes to actual profits. It makes the vast amount of its money to this day on Internet searches. That\u2019s all well and good, but as my friend <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jeffrutherford.com/\">Jeff Rutherford</a>, a public relations and marketing professional pointed out to me, they lack a social sense. That is,\u00a0you can search for restaurants in Brooklyn and all the companies that bought keywords or which people clicked on most frequently will surface to the top, but so far at least, the ones my friends like aren\u2019t part of the results.</p><p>\u201cI define social search as when I go onto Facebook and ask, \u2018Hey everybody, I\u2019m headed to NYC tonight, what new restaurants should I definitely eat at this weekend in Brooklyn?\u2019 That\u2019s a search that will not flow through Google,\u201d Rutherford told me.\u00a0And he\u00a0believes that lack of social savvy could\u00a0haunt Google in the long run. I agree.</p><p>Will any\u00a0of these companies fade by 2020 or will it be just Apple as Wilson suggested? Nobody knows of course, but any of these weaknesses could eventually undermine any one of these companies, and then there is the unknown entity, that third company Wilson suggested that will swoop in and become a force. That is in fact very likely to happen.</p><p>But what impact that will have on the market is hard for any of us to gauge. It\u2019s fun to speculate and it makes great headlines, but none of us knows what the future brings. We only know that we have a handful\u00a0of powerful, extremely well-heeled companies battling it out.</p><p>But\u00a0Wilson is probably right about one thing, the market is going to shift in some significant way in the next 5 or 6 years and for at least one of these mega brands, their weakness\u00a0will be their undoing. How that\u00a0plays out though is anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>PHOTO CREDIT: <!-- HTML Credit Code for Can Stock Photo--> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.canstockphoto.com\">(c) Can Stock Photo</a></p>", "title": ["Let\u2019s Face It, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft All Have Weaknesses"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},

Or not even been conceived of as a mainstream project at all.</p><p>But, post-Snowden, there\u2019s a perfect storm of <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/04/spying-bad-for-business/\">cloud-computing concerns</a> amassing to undermine the convenience of mainstream online services. And, after a month seeking crowdfunding on Kickstarter, Pixeom has passed its funding target of $50,000 \u2014 with close to 400 backers, and still has 15 days left to run on its campaign.</p><p>In addition to the funds it\u2019s currently raising on Kickstarter, Pixeom has also secured\u00a0more than $500,000 in private funding to get this personal cloud device to market.</p><p>It\u2019s clear that Snowden has shone a light on something very rotten lurking at the core of mainstream cloud services. Sure, web mail clients are handy \u2014 and you get a chunk of free storage \u2014 but you\u2019re also effectively handing the keys to your inbox over to the NSA (et al) should they happen to feel like dipping into your personal correspondence one lunchtime or other.</p><p>And of course it\u2019s a given that your personal data will be mined by the service provider; it\u2019s a free service, so your privacy is the product.\u00a0This general snooping on/data-mining of users is a routine business model for the majority of free cloud-based services and apps.</p><p>Multiple big name tech giants have built hugely lucrative businesses off of selling your likes and dislikes to advertisers in exchange for furnishing you with a platform where you can share that data in the first place. Or store the personal stuff they need to peek at to gather sellable intel on you.</p><p>Plus there\u2019s also the sloppy security of (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/31/hackers-claim-to-publish-list-of-4-6m-snapchat-usernames-and-numbers/\">certain</a>) startups that leak your personal info all over the Internets just because they\u2019re more interested in expanding their user-base than expending effort on adequate security measures.</p><p>So it goes.</p><p>Or so it has, but \u2014 whipped up by the storm of snooping revelations \u2014 some counter-currents are (finally) emerging to challenge the accepted wisdom that accessing the convenience of cloud services necessitates giving up your personal data and abandoning any shred of privacy in the process.</p><p>Projects like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/15/blackphone/\">Blackphone</a> or the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/05/dark-mail/\">Dark Mail Alliance</a>. And now <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixeom/pixeom-the-personal-exchange-device\">Pixeom</a>.\u00a0Pixeom\u2019s makers say they want to facilitate a new type of data exchange for Internet users which is hosted on an anti-corporate cloud that sits in your own home \u2014 i.e. not somewhere in a vast datacenter in California where giant branded spiders can crawl all over it.</p><p>One half of the Pixeom founder team, Sam Nagar, who previously worked as a software engineer at Microsoft in Mountain View, describes the device as follows:</p><p>What exactly is Pixeom? It\u2019s a personal, encrypted cloud device that plugs into your home Internet via Ethernet and provides cloud storage for your digital content without having to go through any third party intermediaries, and with support for unlimited expansion of said storage \u2014 either by chaining together multiple Pixeoms, or by plugging in additional USB hard drives.</p><p>The device is not just focused on storage though. The Pixeom platform also offers alternative cloud apps to replace online services \u2014 name-checking the likes of Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, Microsoft Sharepoint, Facebook and Amazon as services it wants to offer an alternative to \u2014 in a simpler (and potentially cheaper) way than by having to set up a NAS box or host your own server.</p><p>The three apps that will be included with Pixeom at launch are called File Exchange; Club Exchange; and Market Exchange \u2014 and they support, respectively, file-sharing &amp; document back-up, collaboration &amp; syncing across multiple devices; discussion boards for secure communication and digital socialising; and an interactive storefront for buying and selling, with Dwolla payment processing built-in.</p><p>Or, in other words, alternatives to stuff like Google Docs, Dropbox, Facebook, and Amazon Marketplace.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-953113\" alt=\"Pixeom screenshot\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-05-at-12-20-49.png?w=633&amp;h=376\" width=\"633\" height=\"376\"></p><p>There are also no subscription fees for using Pixeom or its apps. The business model relies solely on selling the hardware itself \u2014 at least for now. Sam Nagar tells TechCrunch that it may look for additional revenues streams in future.</p><p>\u201cWhile we will make more than enough money off the sales of our devices to support ourselves (we are a very lean startup with high profit margins), we will later consider monetizing off of the Pixeom Exchange Network in more non-traditional ways,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOne of our ideas is if a device owner wanted their content to be discovered more easily, they can pay to have it show up higher on the listings, similar to how Google does it with their search engine, or how Facebook allows you to \u2018sponsor\u2019 a post.\u201d</p><p>The Pixeom device is powered by a Raspberry Pi microcomputer \u2014 making it low power and helping to keep the cost down (early bird Kickstarter pledges for a $100 Pixeom are all gone but you can bag the device for $125). Each Pixeom has 16GB of internal storage, expandable via two USB ports to plug in your own hard drives.</p><p>Pixeom users can also choose for their device to stay private or invite trusted friends to collaborate within the secure network. There\u2019s also an option to join a global network of Pixeom devices so that public content can be shared/advertised within that wider network.</p><p>The collaborative core of Pixeom\u2019s platform means that a Pixeom owner can share content with anyone else (provided they have the ability to access a webpage). There\u2019s no requirement for the content viewer to purchase Pixeom hardware or download their application, although there is a free mobile app for accessing the Pixeom Exchange Network of public content, as an alternative and richer point of entry to accessing this content via a web browser.</p><p>\u201cThe only time someone else needs to buy a Pixeom device is if they want to have their own private area that no one else can see, or if they want to start publishing their own public content on the Pixeom Exchange Network. Otherwise, a team of 25-100 people can all easily share and collaborate on one single device using their web browser,\u201d adds Sam Nagar.</p><p><span style=\"line-height:1.625;\">If all goes to plan Pixeom\u2019s founders are aiming to ship to backers in May. \u00a0You can see the pair\u2019s full Kickstarter pitch in the below video.\u00a0</span></p><p>How many Pixeom\u2019s do the founders reckon they can ship in the first year? \u201cWe project selling 400,000 \u2013 500,000 units worldwide,\u201d says Sam Nagar. \u201cWe are currently lining up channel partners and finalizing the designs for more types of hardware that our stack can run on which will appeal to a variety of users, and after talking with many of them as well as from our own research, we feel this is a fair estimate.\u201d</p><p>The startup also has plans to expand the apps it offers in future \u2014 with cloud games one area it\u2019s already working on \u2014 starting with \u201csomething like a trivia game or a more traditional one like chess/checkers\u201d.</p><p><span style=\"line-height:1.625;\">\u201cPeople could have private games with each other, or match up with each other on the exchange network, all hosted on their devices. Their scores could be published and we could even give away benefits to the top public score of the day like promoting their content within the network. We want to be regularly involved with our user base and will continue to see how we can make using Pixeom regularly to become a fulfilling experience,\u201d adds Nagar.\u00a0</span></p><p>It\u2019s also working on con\u00a0conferencing and telepresence apps, everything from voice to screen sharing, he adds.</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": ["Pixeom Is An Anti-Corporate Cloud Device That Wants To Give You Back Your Data Privacy"], "author": ["Natasha Lomas"]},
{"date": ["2015-10-03"], "text": "<p></p><p>This summer, as Chairman of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://smallbusiness.house.gov/\">House Small Business Committee</a>, I had the opportunity to honor an innovative business accelerator called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cincinnatimade.org/firstbatch/\">First Batch</a>. This isn\u2019t your typical business accelerator. First Batch is a product accelerator in my hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio, that focuses on helping entrepreneurs and makers bring physical products to market. It\u2019s a great resource supporting the intersection of technology and manufacturing, and it\u2019s another example of the resources communities are using to build entrepreneurial ecosystems.<u></u><u></u></p><p>When you think about the entrepreneurial community, you probably picture Silicon Valley. In reality, entrepreneurship is thriving in communities between the coasts. Colorado, Utah, Texas, Kansas, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio are just a few of the states making a real effort to build systems that support new firm formation.</p><p>Efforts to organize business accelerators, make seed funding more available, reduce licensing hurdles that come with starting a new business, provide access to networks of experienced mentors and forge partnerships with local universities are making real headway in fostering communities that welcome disruptive innovation.<u></u><u></u></p><p>And all of this couldn\u2019t come soon enough.<u></u><u></u></p><p>From my post at the House Small Business Committee, I\u2019ve witnessed the disturbing trend of business deaths exceeding the number of business births. To put it simply, more businesses are closing their doors than opening them. It started after the economic downturn in 2008 and has yet to reverse itself. This is a real problem for a number of reasons.</p><p>First and foremost is job creation. Based on the data available, we know that small businesses create the majority of new jobs. If we peel back one more layer though, we find that young firms, those less than five years old, are responsible for the vast majority of net new jobs. A new hair salon may employ a dozen people, but a new technology may create an entirely new industry. And it\u2019s that dramatic economic impact that we risk losing when entrepreneurship declines in America.<u></u><u></u></p><p>The good news is that leaders in business and government recognize that their communities are stronger with more entrepreneurship, and they are doing more to support it. Cincinnati is a case study in these efforts and the transformational power of entrepreneurship.<u></u><u></u></p><p>Besides First Batch, regional leaders have worked to increase the resources available to startups. These include organizations like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.brandery.org/\">Brandery</a>, one of the nation\u2019s top 10 accelerators; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hcdc.com/\">HCDC</a>, the top incubator in the state of Ohio; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cintrifuse.com/\">Cintrifuse</a>, the first regional fund-of-funds in the country; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cincytechusa.com/\">CincyTech</a>, the leading seed-stage investment firm in the Midwest; and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.qca.com/\">Queen City Angels</a>, a local investing group of experienced business leaders.</p><p>In addition, there are four regional universities\u00a0committed to expanding the area\u2019s entrepreneurship by providing unique programming that is driving collaborative relationships and new business development. Moreover, the state of Ohio has furthered these efforts with groundbreaking <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://weare.techohio.ohio.gov/\">public policies</a> that put experienced entrepreneurs on the front lines of state development. All of these resources collectively are designed to attract venture capital to the region, increase deal flow and encourage new business formation. And it\u2019s working.<u></u><u></u></p><p>These entities have breathed life into historic Cincinnati communities like Over-The-Rhine (OTR), which was once infamous as one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in America. Today, it is a thriving urban hub experiencing a renaissance. If it wasn\u2019t for a thoughtful regional strategy that understood the value of entrepreneurship, none of it would be possible.\u00a0\u00a0<u></u><u></u></p><p>These results should motivate every elected official in every part of the country to embrace policies that provide a good starting point for entrepreneurs, and it should motivate entrepreneurs to start these conversations \u2014 now.</p><p>This includes removing barriers to capital and supporting new innovative models of funding, such as peer-to-peer lending and equity-based crowdfunding. It also requires a flexible, light-touch regulatory environment that embraces disruptive technologies. Finally, we must rethink how we utilize public resources. More emphasis should be placed on helping the underserved learn entrepreneurial skills, because these are the building blocks that will create more opportunities.<u></u><u></u></p><p>At the federal level, some positive actions have already been taken. A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate have introduced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/962\">the Startup Act</a>. I am an original cosponsor of this bill, which would create an entrepreneur visa program for immigrants looking to start a business in the United States, and a STEM degree visa program, so that high-skilled graduates from American institutions can stay and create jobs in America.</p><p>The bill would also make permanent the 100 percent exemption on capital gains for investments in small businesses and create a targeted R&amp;D tax credit for startups. While many of the policies that build successful ecosystems for entrepreneurship will rely on local decisions made by local officials, these are certainly a handful of national policies that would give communities a leg up.<u></u><u></u></p><p>We must also look for ways to support STEM education, as it is critical to communities setting out to build modern economies. It probably comes as no surprise that a significant portion of San Francisco\u2019s workforce is employed in STEM-related jobs.\u00a0But it may surprise some to learn that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-stem-jobs/\">places like Boise, Albuquerque and Kansas City</a> are not far behind \u2014 and some towns, such as Huntsville, Alabama, already boast a greater percentage of its workforce in STEM fields.<u></u><u></u></p><p>In many of these communities, the introduction to STEM doesn\u2019t start when a student is deciding what to major in at college; it starts in elementary schools, where teachers integrate STEM into every aspect of their curriculum. It\u2019s used to break down educational silos and start teaching students how to think holistically.</p><p>For example, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.concentratemedia.com/features/annarborSTEAM0323.aspx\">one Michigan teacher explains</a> that instead of just teaching math and then history, her students create pie charts to illustrate the percentage of patriots and loyalists at the start of the revolutionary war. This is the kind of teaching that builds connective tissue between concepts and ideas. And it is exactly what will prepare a new generation of innovators to continue pushing our economy forward. \u00a0\u00a0<u></u><u></u></p><p>So as communities between the coasts take action to support entrepreneurship, it is critical that national leaders take note. The more we strive to empower individuals with entrepreneurial-minded policies, the sooner we can begin to view our national issues as opportunities waiting to be met, and challenges as bumps in the road to creating a successful and valuable company.</p>", "title": ["The Rise Of Entrepreneurial Communities"], "author": ["Rep.

The app is the second we\u2019ve heard from to hit the milestone (Facebook <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/25/facebooks-iphone-app-has-1-million-users/\">reached it</a> last week), and is another testament to the extremely rapid growth some applications have seen on Apple\u2019s newly launched App Store.</p><p>Tapulous CEO Bart Decrem says that the application has been downloaded about 900 thousand times since its launch, and expects to hit the 1 million user milestone over the weekend.  Tapulous\u2019s iPhone Twitter client Twinkle is significantly less popular, with around 80,000 installs, but it was released after Tap Tap Revenge.  Decrem notes that there is a total install base of about 5-6 million iPhones and iPod Touches running the 2.0 firmware (which is compatible with the App Store).  With about 1 million downloads, this puts Tapulous applications on around 20% of all devices \u2013 a very impressive feat.</p><p>One of best features in the original version of the game (which was only available on hacked iPhones) was that users could create tab sheets and play the game with any song in their iPhone\u2019s library.  Unfortunately, Apple prohibits any developer from accessing the iPhone\u2019s library with a native application, so Tapulous has been forced to come up with a different way to introduce new content to the game.  For the time being they\u2019re offering free downloads of new songs directly through the app, but these songs have all been submitted to the company by indie artists (impressively, 2.5 million songs have been downloaded so far).</p><p>As it turns out, a number of record labels have taken notice of Tap Tap Revenge\u2019s quickly growing install base, and are eager to use it as a means of exposing users to new music.  Decrem says that the company is in talks with both indie and more well known artists to create a premium package of songs, which will likely be released in the App Store as a separate game for a small fee.  Subsequent packages will also likely be released as their own independent games, as Apple does not currently offer a way for developers to sell new content from within an application.</p>", "title": ["Tap Tap Revenge Approaches 1 Million Users, Music Industry Takes Notice"], "author": ["Jason Kincaid"]},

Tapulous\u00a0founder Bart\u00a0Decrem says that this game launch has been \u201ctwice as fast, and twice as big\u201d as TTR 3 was in the same time span.</p><p>The launch of Tap Tap Revenge 4 comes around six months after the company was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/01/tapulous-acquired-by-disney/\">acquired</a> by Disney for an undisclosed sum.</p><p>Decrem, who now serves as SVP and General Manager for Disney Mobile, says that the game is seeing around 25,000 downloads per hour right now, which is on par with what it saw on Christmas day last year (app downloads see a major spike on Christmas as people try out their new iPhones and iPod touches, so expect this number to surge even higher this year). Decrem says this is the fastest any of Tapulous\u2019s games have ever hit #1, and it may be the fastest growing game ever (though he doesn\u2019t know that definitively).</p><p>Given that the company has such a large existing install base \u2014\u00a0Decrem says Tapulous is coming up on 50 million total downloads between all of its applications \u2014\u00a0Tapulous can more easily gain traction with a new game than a small-time developer could, because it can send promotions to existing users. But Decrem says that Tapulous is only tapping into around a third of its viral channels so far (namely, interstitials in TTR3), and that it will save its other big guns like emails and push notifications for once the initial buzz for the game dies down.</p><p>Among the new features introduced with TTR4 are support for Apple\u2019s Game Center, higher resolution graphics for the iPhone\u2019s Retina Display, a stronger social component where you can \u2018Like\u2019 songs and challenge users with similar tastes, and a wider selection of both free and premium music downloads.</p><p>Decrem says that Tapulous has some other big news coming up: in January it will be announcing its lineup for the leadership team of Disney Mobile based out of Palo Alto. Decrem also says that both Tapulous and other Disney applications are going to begin incorporating a standard set of\u00a0analytics\u00a0and advertising libraries, as it looks to become the App Store\u2019s largest freemium gaming network.<br>\n</p>", "title": ["Tap Tap Revenge 4 Surges To #1 On The App Store With 25,000 Downloads Per Hour"], "author": ["Jason Kincaid"]},

We\u2019ve more-than expected Apple Maps, iCloud features, and Facebook integration, but the rumor mill had taken us further than that, with hopes of Siri APIs, Siri for iPad, and even deeper customization, with live apps not unlike the live tiles seen in Windows Phone\u2019s metro UI.</p><p>So which dreams came true, and which will be left for later generations of the software?</p><p>All that after the break (and I\u2019ll be updating as the announcement is made so be sure to hit refresh).</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/mgt3606.jpg\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/mgt3606.jpg?w=640&amp;h=426\" alt=\"\" title=\"_MGT3606\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-569613\" height=\"426\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p><strong>Some Thoughts:</strong> The fact that Siri is tapping into other apps to launch, and playing so nicely with Twitter leads us to believe that Siri APIs aren\u2019t far off, even if Apple doesn\u2019t announce them today.

Email, which should come in handy on the iPad, seems split down the middle with around a quarter of users saying they email with Siri daily, and another 30 percent saying they don\u2019t use Siri for email at all.

Based on this latest leak, it would appear that much-awaited NFC will fill that hole.</p><p>Apple\u2019s traditionally been great at keeping its forthcoming products under wraps, but this pre-iPhone season has been <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/21/is-this-apples-new-iphone-yeah-sure-why-not/\">particularly fruitful</a>. If we take all the evidence provided and pair it up with common sense, NFC seems like a very real possibility.

The company, which says it\u2019s now seeing over a million monthly visits from web and mobile, had first announced this feature<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/zumper-zapp/\">\u00a0last fall</a>. However, at the time, it was only available in beta on web and Android, even though Zumper\u00a0expects most usage to take place via iOS.</p><p>The feature, which is now known as \u201cInstant Apply,\u201d could help give potential renters an edge over others in competitive real estate markets, like that of San Francisco where Zumper is currently headquartered. Explains CEO\u00a0Anthemos Georgiades, there are always multiple offers on the same apartment, so being able to apply immediately from your phone can help you beat others looking at the same\u00a0property.</p><p>\u201cUsing Zumper\u2019s iPhone app, renters can apply for the apartment from their phone in the open house,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because Zumper has very strong B2B adoption through 10,000+ Zumper Pros, renters\u2019 applications are guaranteed to be reviewed when they carry the \u2018Instant Apply\u2019 symbol,\u201d he adds.</p><p>In addition to offering a mobile-friendly rental application, Zumper\u2019s iPhone users can also purchase a $10 credit report directly from the new iPhone app, which they can pay for using Apple Pay. That report is then submitted alongside their application, which can speed up the sometimes cumbersome process of compiling all the necessary paperwork needed for a rental application.</p><p>Georgiades also notes that Zumper is now powering over 10% of the rental applications \u2013 meaning several hundred per month \u2013 in San Francisco, the first market where Instant Apply went\u00a0live. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s B2B tool <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zumper.com/pro\">Zumper Pro</a> originates over 25% of all the rental listings in major U.S. markets, including not only San Francisco, but also New York, Boston and Chicago.</p><p>\u201cBecause the majority of applications and Experian credit reports are submitted when one of our B2B\u00a0Zumper Pro users requests a renter\u2019s application, well over 75% of applications are successful in closing the apartment,\u201d the CEO claims.</p><p>Now a team of 19, Zumper has raised <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/03/zumper-6-5m-kpcb/\">$6.5 million to date from KPCB</a> and others, including\u00a0Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock, CrunchFund [disclosure: founded by TechCrunch\u2019s founder], and The Experiment Fund.

{"date": ["2011-10-31"], "text": "<p>It hits you when you least expect it. It slips away under a mask of dormant inactivity. And it can ruin your entire day. </p><p>It\u2019s your iPhone 4S battery life, and it <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/27/apple-iphone-4s-battery-life-suck-less/\">sucks</a>. </p><p>It\u2019s been 17 days since the iPhone 4S was released \u2014 19 since iOS 5 \u2014 and just like the madness that was Antennagate, complaints are churning out left and right. As Erick so clearly pointed out, the iPhone 4S is meant to offer 8 hours of talk time, or \u201cup to 6 hours\u201d of Internet use on 3G. For so many of us \u2014 including iPod touch and iPhone-not-4Ses running iOS 5 \u2014 that simply isn\u2019t the case. But there may be hope. </p><p>To start, there are a few possible bugs in iOS 5 that may be sucking an inordinate amount of life out of your battery: a calendar bug and a time zone bug (one of which can be summarily blamed on location services, as can most of the other battery life killers in iOS 5/iPhone 4S). </p><p><strong>The calendar bug</strong> is still somewhat unclear, but has been reported in <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/message/16581689#16581689\">Apple forums</a>. Basically, when your calendar app is turned on in the Notifications Center, events are \u201cre-ordering themselves near-constantly,\u201d which sucks the life straight out of the phone. The only fix as of now, unfortunately, seems to be disabling the calendar app within the Notifications center.</p><p><strong>The Time Zone bug</strong>, however, seems to be solved (although again, by disabling things). Oliver Haslam over at <a href=\"http://www.idownloadblog.com/2011/10/27/tip-cure-iphone-4s-battery/\">iDownloadBlog</a> noticed, like many of us, that iOS 5 was sucking his iPhone 4 battery dry. He realized that by going into Settings &gt; Location Services &gt; System Services (all the way at the bottom) &gt; Setting Time Zone, and toggling off the location services, his battery life nearly doubled. According to Haslam, iOS 5 probably has a bug that constantly pings the servers to update location, and thus update time zone settings. </p><p><strong>When it comes down to it, iOS 5\u2019s location services are most usually the culprit</strong> in cases of random battery life drainage for no apparent reason. It allows your apps and other services to ping for your location way more often than before, but in many cases it\u2019s totally unnecessary (like TapTap Revenge, for example). Just head into Settings &gt; Location Services and browse through the various apps using the phone\u2019s location.

And, any one of the services you turn off can always be turned back on. No harm done. </p><p><strong>Email, especially with certain settings, can really wear on your battery</strong> since the Mail app can be set to ping mail servers almost constantly. An easy way to help spare some green bar is to really take a look at your account(s) and what you need out of them. If most of your emails tend to be about daily deals or new book releases, do you really need them pushed immediately to your phone?

{"date": ["2013-01-27"], "text": "<p><em>In doing research for a post on <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/27/the-enterprise-cool-kids/\">\u201cThe Enterprise Cool Kids\u201d</a> at the tail end of last year, I interviewed Silicon Valley veteran <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marc-andreessen\">Marc Andreessen</a> about where he thought the enterprise was headed. </em></p><p><em>While excerpts of that interview made it into the post, the transcript of the entire interview was so good it deserved to be published in its entirety.</em></p><p>************************</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: Since people like me (millennials) are putting pressure on our IT departments to buy products that we can actually use and aren\u2019t blinded by, what do you think the enterprise space will look like in the next five years?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Yeah. So let me maybe start with sort of \u2013 top-down and bottoms-up is how we think about it, because both are important \u2014 so let me start with historical context and then maybe go to the stuff happening right now. Is that all set?</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: Yeah, it\u2019s perfect.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> So the computer industry started in 1950 and basically ran for 50 years with the same model, which was a model where all of the new computers, all the new technology, all the new software started out being sold for the highest prices to the biggest organizations.</p><p>So originally the customer was the Department of Defense. It was the first customer for the computer. In fact, one of the big first computers was called SAGE, which was a missile defense, the first missile-defense computer, which was like one of the first computers in the history of the world which got sold to the Department of Defense for, I don\u2019t know, tens and tens of millions of dollars at the time. Maybe hundreds of millions of dollars in current dollars.</p><p>And then five years later computers became \u2014 they dropped half in price and then the big insurance companies could buy them, and that\u2019s when Thomas Watson, who ran IBM at the time, was quoted as saying, \u201cThere\u2019s only a market need in the world for five computers.\u201d</p><p>The reason that wasn\u2019t crazy when he said it is because there were only five organizations that were big enough to buy a computer. So that\u2019s how it started. And then IBM came along and productized the mainframe, and then all of a sudden big normal companies \u2014 manufacturing companies and banks \u2014 could start to buy computers. And then DEC came along and came out with the minicomputer, and then all of a sudden smaller companies could start to buy computers. And then the PC came out and then all of a sudden individuals could start to buy computers. But the PC only ever got to hundreds of millions of people. It never got to billions of people.</p><p>Now, the smartphone has come out and it can get to billions of people.</p><p>And so it has always been this kind of trickle-down model for 50 years. We think that basically about 10 years ago the model flipped. And so we think that the model flipped to a model where, today, where the most interesting and advanced new technology now comes out for the consumer first. And then small businesses start to use it. And then medium-size businesses start to use it, and then large businesses start to use it, and then eventually the government starts to use it. But this is a complete change from the way it has always worked.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis</strong><strong>: It\u2019s grassroots versus trickle-down.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Versus trickle-down. And the reason is because \u2013 the reason fundamentally is because now that you have got these things, you have \u2014 now that you have a computer in everybody\u2019s hand, all of a sudden all these barriers \u2014 it used to be these barriers to market entry were so big, it used to be there just weren\u2019t that many early adopters in the world. To bring out a new technology for consumers first, you just had a very long road to go down to try to find people who actually would pay money for something.</p><p>And now all of a sudden you have got this global market of all these early adopters that have smartphones connected to the Internet, and they can just pick up their things and run with them.</p><p>And of course consumers can make buying decisions much more quickly than businesses can, because for the consumer, they either like it or they don\u2019t, whereas businesses have to go through these long and involved processes.</p><p>So that\u2019s the big, big, big change that\u2019s happened. And that\u2019s been reflected in the entrepreneurial community, where entrepreneurs, especially between 2000 and 2008, entrepreneurs really only wanted to do \u2014 for the most part wanted to do consumer software, because that\u2019s the only software that they could actually get anybody to adopt. It became very hard to get businesses to adopt new stuff.</p><p>In the last five years, there\u2019s been this sort of acknowledgment of the consumerization of the enterprise, which is consumer product development, design methods applied to business software, of which SaaS and cloud and all these things are examples. Salesforce.com, Evernote is an example. So now you have got the rise of this new set of companies that are sort of consumerized technology for businesses.</p><p>Then from a bottoms-up standpoint what you said is exactly right, I think, which is that the new generation of employees grew up on smartphones and tablets and touch and everything, social networking and Twitter and everything else. And so if you take a typical mainframe or, even these days, PC-based system and you give it to a 22-year-old college graduate, it\u2019s like beaming in products out of the Stone Age. Why would you do that? Why would you force people to use all this old stuff?</p><p>And then that leads to the big thing that\u2019s starting to happen right now, which is this \u201cBring Your Own Device\u201d movement, where more and more companies are saying, well, basically, if I have to support smartphones and tablets anyway, and my CFO is probably carrying around an iPad and all my new employees are coming in with iPhones, so I have already got to support this stuff, so then I might as well encourage it.</p><p>And I might as well basically have a model where instead of issuing a company laptop to everybody or even a company phone, why don\u2019t I just let people bring in whatever device they want and just plug-in and access it.</p><p>And then they get all excited, because then they say, well, not only are my employees going to be happier and more productive, but then I don\u2019t have to buy them hardware anymore, so I can cut my budget. So that\u2019s the big thing that\u2019s starting to happen right now.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: So how does it affect the way people are building? I have about five companies that have made this list. Some of them are yours \u2014 Okta, which is big on the Bring Your Own Device thing, because you are logging in through Okta. Okta, Cloudera, Box, GitHub, Zendesk, and Asana. Are there any that I have missed?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> We just invested in this company called ItsOn, that we announced yesterday.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>Oh, the mobile \u2014</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> The mobile billing. The advantage \u2014 the thing that that\u2019s going to be able to do is do split billing in a new way, between the business and the consumer. So on a single device you will be able to cleanly build data usage by application. So your employer can pay for your Salesforce.com and your Workday data usage on your phone and you get to pay for your Facebook and your Hulu usage. So that will be another enabler for a lot more of the Bring Your Own Device stuff.</p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> We have a bunch of stealth investments. I mean, this is a big, big thing \u2014 big change for us, so we have a bunch of stealth investments \u2014 I mean, companies that haven\u2019t talked about what they are doing yet.</p><p>Who else? I mean, there is a bunch, who else should we have \u2014</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>Platfora.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> What\u2019s that, Platfora? Yeah, Platfora is the actual user interface layer on top of Hadoop. So sort of Platfora and Cloudera kind of go hand in hand.</p><p>Actually \u2014 we have another one actually that is \u2014 well, it sounds esoteric, but it actually is very relevant. We have a company called Tidemark, which is in a category. It\u2019s called Enterprise Performance Management, which is kind of a weird term. It\u2019s basically large-scale financial planning and analysis for big companies.</p><p>The significance is it has a \u2014 I believe it only \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it only or primarily, but I think it only has an iPad UI. So it\u2019s the first complex financial system for big companies, where the assumption is that the user is on an iPad.</p><p>That\u2019s a really big deal, because that category of software, line managers and businesses have never actually used that software themselves. Instead they employ analysts to use the software who become highly trained on the software.</p><p>By putting the iPad UI all of a sudden you can have anybody in the business have access to all the financial analysis and planning. Even in a very deep sort of sector of enterprise software where most people would never see it, this change is having a big impact.</p><p>What else? Asana you mentioned.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: Asana, Box, Zendesk, these are the companies that I am assuming I will be using four years from now to run my business.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Yeah, exactly! Exactly right! Then of course Workday, of course, Salesforce.com, of course NetSuite, 37signals. We probably have three or four others in our portfolio that I am blanking on, but yeah, this is sort of the \u2014 and then by the way, the corresponding thing is that a lot of this is on how you run a business and then how you do marketing, of course; AdWords and Facebook and Twitter, all these systems and then all the enabling systems for that; so HootSuite and Marketo and \u2014</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: GoodData.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Oh, another one, GoodData. So GoodData is at the intersection of kind of marketing and business. So GoodData is an actual easy-to-use analytics package. It\u2019s sort of like a supercharged version of Excel that lets you suck in data, you can suck in all your Facebook advertising campaigns, you can suck in all your Salesforce.com data, and you can run \u2014 you can actually, yourself, as a small business person, actually analyze and find friends and data.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: I have heard good things about them and they just sent us a guest post.\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> They are very good. So then you add up all these companies and you are like, \u201cWell, okay, so number one, they are all basically new companies. I think who is not on that list are all the existing companies that sell business software.\u201d</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>SAP, Oracle \u2026 I mean I wrote <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/03/zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz/\">a post about this </a>that was supremely misunderstood and then today SAP came out with SAP Jam, which is a competitor to Yammer and to Salesforce, but it\u2019s their own socialized CRM, like HR management software. I worry about this because it\u2019s not going to work. You can\u2019t fight the future.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Oh, right, right, right. I mean, the joke about SAP has always been, it\u2019s making 50s German manufacturing methodology, implemented in 1960s software technology, delivered to 1970-style manufacturing organizations, like it\u2019s really \u2014 yeah, the incumbency \u2014 they are still the lingering hangover from the dot-com crash.</p><p>So a lot of incumbent business software companies did what a lot of big companies actually did and other industries, media companies after the dot-com crash, which is they said, \u201cOh, thank God we don\u2019t have to worry about this Internet thing. It\u2019s over. Stick a fork in it. It\u2019s not going to be a big deal.\u201d And then it turned out that it actually wasn\u2019t over, and they still haven\u2019t adjusted.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: Yes, and we are watching that now. And so the other reason that I am very interested in delving deep into this space is that it seems like IPOs like Workday, Palo Alto Networks are sort of \u2014 they have metrics and analytics that Wall Street understands, more so than a Facebook; like \u201cWe are going to sell X number of this in the next year.\u201d So it would seem like they are an antidote to, or at least less offensive than, social/consumer Internet companies are to the public markets.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> For now. The whole market goes back and forth in whether they prefer enterprise businesses or consumer businesses. The argument in favor of consumer businesses is you don\u2019t have these crazy end of quarters like when the IT purchasing manager doesn\u2019t buy the product and the company misses the whole quarter.</p><p>The advantage of the consumer businesses is they tend to be much broader-based, much larger number of customers, that tend to over time be a lot more predictable. The advantage of the enterprise companies is they are not as subject to consumer trend, fad, behavior.</p><p>But I would say the market is schizophrenic. So right now we are in an era where the market wants enterprise companies. I am just saying like wait a year, that will flip again; wait another year after that, that will flip again.</p><p>It\u2019s sort of the picks and shovels thing. Like everybody \u2014 it\u2019s like the consumer businesses get really hot and then everybody realizes that there is lots of competition and that those models have \u2014 they are complicated businesses and they have their issues, and then everybody gets all excited about picks and shovels.</p><p>And everybody rediscovers the picks and shovels analogy and says, \u201d Oh, the Gold Rush in California, the people that made all the money were the guys who were selling picks and shovels to the prospectors.\u201d And then people realize the picks and shovels business is really hard, and then everybody says, \u201cOh, we should invest in the consumer company because they\u201d \u2014 so it\u2019s just \u2014</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: It\u2019s cyclical.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> It\u2019s cyclical. It\u2019s deeply cyclical. But we are in an environment right now, to your point, where there has been huge rotation out of the consumer companies into the enterprise companies.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: It seems like the consumer market is starting to cool \u2014 I mean, not starting, but the signaling is there.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Yeah. It\u2019s unpredictable. All you need is for one of the new enterprise companies to completely whiff a quarter and their stock will collapse and then everybody will get all freaked out. I mean, it\u2019s just a continuous \u2014 the reality is every single business is hard.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: I love this.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> There are no easy businesses in the world other than maybe Google, but other than that, there is no easy business anywhere in the world. So what happens is Wall Street gets enamored by the businesses that look like they are easy, until it turns out that they are not, and then Wall Street gets disillusioned and freaked out, and then rotates into the businesses that they think are going to be easy, and then they get endless disappointment. It\u2019s like a seventh or eighth marriage at some point.</p><p>At some point the problem isn\u2019t with your seventh wife. At some point the problem is with you.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: Is the solution \u201ckeep calm and carry on,\u201d or what is the solution to this?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> There is no solution; it\u2019s a permanent state of affairs. So this is a big part of what actually we do. A big part of why venture capital actually is important and enduring is because the public market is flighty and late-stage investors are flighty, and customers for that matter are flighty, and so you can\u2019t \u2014 if you are running one of these companies you can\u2019t \u2014 you just can\u2019t rely on people being balanced. They are just not going to be.</p><p>And so you have to have a level of determination to just stick through the good times and the bad times. And you need to have investors at the core of your company who are going to support you through that.</p><p>The big advantage that we have as a venture capital firm over a hedge fund or a mutual fund is we have a 13-year lockup on our money. And so enterprise can go in and out of fashion four different times, and we can go and invest in one of these companies, and it\u2019s okay, because we can stay the course.</p><p>And then what happens is everything tends to get better, all the products tend to get better, all the companies tend to get better over time if they are working hard at it. So we are fine. Like if everything we are investing in goes out of fashion, we are not going to change anything we do, because we can\u2019t change anything. We are already invested in these companies; we can\u2019t sell our stock. We don\u2019t have to sell our stock. So we just say, we will go back to work. And then at some point it really gets exciting again.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: I guess the trick is to be hyper-aware.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> So the big thing we try to do is be aware of the difference between the reality and the psychology, and the reality tends to progress in a certain way and then psychology tends to whip all over the place.</p><p>It was very educational for a lot of us to go through the dot-com crash, because you remember, in 2002, like there were a number of universal truths asserted in 2002; the Internet didn\u2019t matter, consumer Internet business was dead. Larry Ellison in 2002 came out and gave a speech and said the correct model for enterprise software, enterprise computing, will last for 1,000 years.</p><p>He said all these kids that were trying all this new stuff and it didn\u2019t work, and now we know it didn\u2019t work, and so the model is going to be the existing IBM and Oracle for the next 1,000 years. And everybody kind of said, hmm, you know, that makes a lot of sense, like all that innovation stuff didn\u2019t work, and so \u2014</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: That\u2019s what David Sacks <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/19/sad-sacks/\">said</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Exactly, this is the fact. People reach a point where they start to get a little bit too rich, maybe a little bit too old, and they start to say these things.</p><p>And then so here we sit 10 years later and we are in the middle of a complete reinvention of everything in enterprise computing, and it\u2019s like, okay, like that\u2019s the reality. People happen to be excited about it again at the moment. That\u2019s great. I am happy for that. But wait two years and they will be depressed about it again, but that won\u2019t keep it from happening. It will still happen.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: It\u2019s just like the fashion industry. So because it\u2019s heavily fashionable now, do you see it being over in a year?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> No, I don\u2019t mean to make a specific prediction. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a year, two years, four years. Look, all of the products are going to keep getting better. All of the trends that we are talking about are going to keep continuing. Nothing is going to stop consumerization of the enterprise. Nothing is going to stop Bring Your Own Device. Nothing is going to stop Software-as-a-Service. Nothing is going to stop cloud. All those things are just going to keep going.</p><p>I am just saying people are going to be \u2014 they are all excited about them now. At some point again they will be unexcited about them and then at some point after that they will be excited about them again. So it\u2019s hard to draw conclusions about the importance of the trends or the progress of the trends by the current level of press coverage, the current level of Wall Street enthusiasm.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: So beyond the press coverage, beyond the fickleness of trends, beyond the application layers \u2014 because most of those companies are just apps \u2014 what are the real opportunities you see in the enterprise stack as it stands right now?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Well, there is a whole bunch. So there is a big thing \u2014 there are a couple of big things that are happening. So one of the really big things that\u2019s happening is, historically the best enterprise technology was only \u2014 it\u2019s a trickle-down thing \u2014 the best business technology was only ever available to the biggest companies.</p><p>And so if you were a Fortune 500 company with a big IT department, you had a huge advantage over a small business that was trying to compete with you, because you just had so much more budget and staff and professionals and expertise and access to all these big vendors and you could spend tens and millions of dollars on all this stuff.</p><p>So it was very easy for \u2014 in the old world it was very easy for big companies to use IT as a weapon against small companies.</p><p>The classic was Walmart versus local retailer, right? Walmart\u2019s advantage in logistics and in pricing and in data analytics was just so great that they could kill small retailers at will.</p><p>Today all the consumerized enterprise stuff is as easily usable by the small business as it is by the large business.\u00a0In fact, it\u2019s probably more easily usable by the small business than it is by the large business, because with a small business it\u2019s like you can just use it, like you don\u2019t have to go through a long process, you don\u2019t have to have a lot of meetings, you don\u2019t have to have committees, you don\u2019t have to have all this stuff, you can just start picking up and using it.</p><p>So the best technology for inventory management and for financial planning and for sales-force management and for online marketing can now be used just as easily or more easily by a small business. There is an opportunity here for a shift of the balance of power for big businesses to small businesses.</p><p>And then for vendors, the companies we fund, there\u2019s an opportunity to really dramatically expand the market, because a company like Oracle, as successful as it is, it only really has about 5,000 customers that really matter worldwide. Whereas, a company like Box or a company like GitHub could have 500,000 customers or 5 million customers that really matter, and that\u2019s a huge change.</p><p>So market expansion, small business versus big business, what else? Oh, the shift, the other big one, the shift from CAPEX to OPEX. So the shift from buying a lot of servers and databases and software licenses and networking equipment, the shift instead to just renting it all. So the shift towards cloud services.</p><p>So we don\u2019t have \u2014 no company that we invest in anymore actually ever buys any hardware. I mean, they buy their laptops and that\u2019s basically it. And increasingly they might not buy their laptops, because their employees will just bring their own devices. But they don\u2019t buy servers. They don\u2019t buy storage devices. They don\u2019t buy any of this stuff, they just rent on AWS. And they don\u2019t buy sales-force automation software, they rent on Salesforce.com.</p><p>And so having sort of a much lighter-touch way for businesses to be able to get funded, you just need a much smaller budget. And that\u2019s why you see these \u2014 you see it in the startup world, you see three or four kids with laptops who are able to go do amazing things on a global scale for no money. And I think businesses are going to figure out more and more how to do that as well.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: Do you think that the biggest inefficiencies are at the network layer, the database layer, or the storage layer currently?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> All the above. They are all changing. I think they are all changing.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>What do you think about the interplay between the enterprise market becoming more efficient and the explosion of the consumer market because you don\u2019t have to pay for something like storage?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s sort of all intertwined. I mean it\u2019s all \u2014 because a lot of what businesses do is then offer consumer services based on all these changes. So it\u2019s kind of all \u2014 that\u2019s why I say it\u2019s kind of all happening at the same time, a lot of the same stuff.</p><p>I would say the consumer Internet companies \u2014 in a lot of ways if you go inside the consumer Internet companies and you see how they run, it\u2019s how all their businesses are going to run. They are going to be doing all of the same kinds of things. The big businesses are just in the process of trying to figure out how to catch up.</p><p>So everything, Hadoop and scale-out architectures and cloud services, and the whole thing it\u2019s all \u2014 and use of new technologies like Box and GitHub, the consumer Internet companies all are just built this way. And then if you go inside a big consumer product\u2019s company or a big manufacturing company, they are all trying to figure out how to make the jump. But it\u2019s all kind of the same stuff.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: So which of the big incumbents do you think are most likely to get disrupted by this new wave of the enterprise cool kids?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Yeah, this is the part where I get into the most trouble.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: That\u2019s why we save it for the end.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Yeah, exactly! I don\u2019t know if I am going to \u2014 let\u2019s see, I am going to try and figure out if I am even going to answer the question.</p><p>So I would say for sure \u2014 like the systems companies, like the companies that provide hardware, the server companies and networking companies, the bad news for them is the end customers are not going to buy as much stuff; the good news is the cloud companies are buying a lot of stuff.</p><p>So for every server that\u2019s not bought at a manufacturing company, there\u2019s a server being bought at Amazon. So it\u2019s a change in purchasing pattern for all the gear, but the gear is still being bought.</p><p>I think it\u2019s at the software layer where the big disruption happens. I think it\u2019s application software in particular and just sort of an extended infrastructure software. It\u2019s like anything for which there is a \u2014 any piece of installed software for which there\u2019s a web or a cloud equivalent, I think is in real trouble, and I think that\u2019s just now becoming clear.</p><p>The other thing that\u2019s happened is 2012 seems to be the year of the actual SaaS tipping point, like where big companies are now saying, you know what, it\u2019s fine, like I can do it, I can do Salesforce, I can do Workday. Because there used to be lots of issues around can I trust the security issues or liability issues, and an awful lot of big companies are now saying, \u201cYou know what, I am going to save so much money, the service is going to be so much better, my users are going to be so much happier, more productive. I have got to make this stuff work on iPhones anyway, so I have got to do something new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy old software vendors are charging me these huge upgrade and maintenance prices. I can switch to SaaS for less than the cost of the maintenance on the old software.\u201d Like, at a certain point it becomes \u2013\u201cOh,\u201d and then on security it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, I may have concerns about SaaS security, but it turns out I have the concerns about my own internal security anyway.\u201d</p><p>So every one of these companies has had an employee steal a laptop that has 25 million customer records on it, and they are like, \u201cWell, okay, if I can\u2019t even lock that down, then why am I that worried about whether somebody is going to break into Salesforce.com?\u201d And by the way, Salesforce.com has gotten much better at security.</p><p>So there is a bunch of new technologies coming out that are going to make cloud and SaaS even more secure, and I think are going to end up making \u2014 I think cloud and SaaS are going to end up being a lot more secure than anything inside the firewall. So that\u2019s the other thing that\u2019s about to happen.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>So which enterprise companies are doing their best to adapt to just this tidal wave of trends and which ones are just completely failing?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> The problem is I have conflicts on this issue, because I am on the HP board in particular, so I can\u2019t really \u2014 unfortunately I am kind of gagged on the topic of the big companies.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>Are you happy with how HP is doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> This is exactly what I can\u2019t talk about. I just can\u2019t talk about it. So the problem is I can\u2019t talk about HP and I can\u2019t talk about HP\u2019s competitors, so it\u2019s just a no-fly zone for me.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: I respect that.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> So I have to stick to the startups.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>Let\u2019s see, what about other companies that aren\u2019t in your portfolio?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Although I have a lot of opinions. You mean startups?</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>What about startups that aren\u2019t in your portfolio, because you said that only 10, 15 companies a year are responsible for 97 percent of the returns. Which enterprise companies that aren\u2019t in your portfolio are you interested in?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> So let\u2019s see, there is this category of kind of outsourced work.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>TaskRabbit.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Well, there\u2019s TaskRabbit and Zaarly and companies like that on the consumer side; and then on the business side there\u2019s eLance and oDesk and RentACoder. So these companies that are kind of for \u2014 in the sort of mechanical term, distributed workforces and outsource work being run online.</p><p>So like oDesk, oDesk you can actually have remote contractors working on a project, and one of the features is that it actually takes snapshots of their screen every five minutes. You can see if \u2014 anybody who actually manages anybody, number one that sounds spooky, but number two, \u201cWow, that sounds great, like, I sure wish I can do that.\u201d</p><p>So there is sort of the whole category of an outsourced workforce that sort of \u2014 it goes back to what you said about the employees is, you will have \u2014 it feels a lot like in the new economy you will have a lot more contractors. You will have a lot more people with sort of fluid careers contracting on a project basis, and then all this technology is going to be an enabling layer for that.</p><p>So anybody on their laptop, anywhere in the world, being able to tap in and be able to get work and do work, whether it\u2019s for small companies or big companies like that. There is a whole layer of software there. We haven\u2019t seen anybody really punch through on that yet, but I am very fascinated by it. We haven\u2019t made an investment there yet. That\u2019s one layer.</p><p>Let me think, what else haven\u2019t we done? I mean, Cloudera is I think a good \u2014 we haven\u2019t actually done an investment at that. We haven\u2019t done an investment at the Hadoop layer. We have done \u2014 Platfora is our investment, which is the intelligence layer above Hadoop, but Cloudera definitely deserves to be on the list.</p><p>Zendesk and kind of its generation of companies are definitely for real, or so it appears.</p><p>What else? We have been pretty active. I mean, we have been trying to take down mostly good companies. We haven\u2019t done anything yet with this whole category of marketing, the new marketing software so like Marketo and HootSuite and companies like that, we haven\u2019t really done anything yet, but that\u2019s a big deal.</p><p>It\u2019s sort of like \u2014 if you are starting a new company it\u2019s so obvious that you would want to do most of your marketing on Google and Facebook and Twitter, whereas a lot of the existing companies still haven\u2019t wrapped their heads around that.</p><p>Education \u2014 there is actually going to be more and more. So actually companies are going to get a lot more interested in education for two reasons.</p><p>Number one is, a lot of companies need to actually educate their customers or their partners, and a lot of that has to happen online.</p><p>And then the other thing is companies are having \u2014 if you talk to anybody running a company, they are having real trouble hiring enough qualified people. So companies are going to have to take a more direct role in educating the candidates or educating their current employees.</p><p>So the sort of model of employees just show up and they are either educated or they are not is not working very well. There\u2019s lots of mismatches. It\u2019s one of the reasons unemployment is running as high as it is, is people just don\u2019t have the skills they need for the jobs.</p><p>So I think employers are going to have to get a lot more actively involved in making sure that the supply of candidates is actually educated and that they can hire somebody who doesn\u2019t yet know what they need to know and actually educate and train them, and a lot of that is going to happen with the new technology.</p><p>So we have this company Udacity as an example, that\u2019s going to be, I think, important in all of that.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: I think the model there is if someone shows up and they have got 80 percent of the skills.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Yeah, let\u2019s teach them \u2014 right, exactly, the employer says let\u2019s teach them the other 20 percent. And it\u2019s like, well, instead of literally sending them to college, which presumably didn\u2019t work the first time around or whatever, let\u2019s just go ahead and provide them with the online training. Let\u2019s set them up with their tablet at home with high-definition video. They can develop their remaining skills, or be able to retrain people once they are in the jobs.</p><p>The other is there is this real issue, like for some people it feels great to never be tied to a specific employer and to always be doing contract work and be changing jobs every two years, and it feels like it\u2019s fun and exciting and exhilarating. For a lot of people that\u2019s really scary. And so the lifetime employment promise that the big companies used to be able to make was very compelling for a lot of people because it felt safe.</p><p>So now you are in a world where the big companies can\u2019t deliver \u2014 even if they wanted to deliver on lifetime employment, they can\u2019t, and so then they have got sort of two choices.</p><p>One is, do they start to basically be a lot rougher with their \u2014 they start to do a lot more layoffs, a lot more restructurings. I remember IBM \u2014 I don\u2019t think IBM had a layoff for 50 years. And I was actually at IBM \u2014 I was an intern at IBM when they were ramping up for their first layoff I think they had ever done, and, like, the level of freak out in the company was beyond belief. And people had no idea what to do if they got laid off from IBM. And it turns out their skills weren\u2019t actually very useful to work for any other company, because IBM was so unique in how it ran.</p><p>So I think the companies have a real question about how do they develop their workforces, how do they make sure that their employees stay relevant for the purpose of staying inside a company for a longer period of time? And then how do you get the workforce over time to be a lot more flexible and adaptable, so that if you have to layoff a ton of people, or if you have to get out of a line of business, or if you have to expand into a new business, how do you get your current employees to adapt better to that?</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>Do you think that\u2019s the most ripe-for-disruption area in the enterprise currently?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the most, but it\u2019s a big issue for every company. It\u2019s a big issue for companies, because companies have hundreds and thousands of employees, it\u2019s like, yeah.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>What are the top three issues that startups don\u2019t exist for yet, because that sounds like one that a startup doesn\u2019t exist for \u2026</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Sort of. Education is a big component of it, yeah, it\u2019s possible, it\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t know. We will wait for the entrepreneurs to answer that question.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>Probably the biggest enterprise cool kid is GitHub?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> They are a big one, yeah.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>And you made a major investment?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Yeah. We think it\u2019s the largest investment ever done.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: How did you convince them to take your money?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> That\u2019s the key thing. So they were beating off venture capitalists with a stick. So they actually \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you remember this, they used to have on their website, they used to say \u2014 they had four metrics that they would put on their website. They had, I think, it was number of users, number of projects, number of code check-ins, and amount of venture capital that they had raised, and that final number was always zero, and they were really proud of that.</p><p><span style=\"font-size:13px;\">The GitHub guys did an amazing job. It\u2019s very rare actually to find a main \u2014 it\u2019s very rare to find an important company that never raised any money. It\u2019s very rare that they actually successfully bootstrapped, because it\u2019s just so hard to do if you can\u2019t invest any money.</span></p><p>So what they did was incredibly impressive. They reached a point though where they decided that they had the opportunity to become a very big and important company. And again, I would say there was a top-down and a bottom-up reason for that.</p><p>The top-down reason was they are the place, we think, and they believe, they are the place where all the software code wants to live. They are the place where all the open source code increasingly lives. All other code increasingly uses a ton of open source code. And so all the software basically wants to be in the same place, and it wants to be in the place where all the open source software is.</p><p>So they have an opportunity to be the main company that provides the systems for developing software, number one, which is just a very big opportunity, and they really decided to go for it, and that requires investment on their part.</p><p>And then the bottom-up reason was because they have enterprise customers lining up, like they have enterprise customers bombarding them with interest in buying services on GitHub. And they did not have \u2014 at the time we invested they didn\u2019t yet have any sort of sales or marketing kind of motion to be able to do it on. They didn\u2019t have a Salesforce, they didn\u2019t have the sort of pricing plans \u2014 the whole thing to be able to do that \u2014 and we have a lot of experience with that.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: So who are the enterprise companies and do they have \u2014</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Tons, it\u2019s like the who\u2019s who. I mean, they gave us access. One of the things they did in the diligence process was they gave us access to the email box that had all the incoming messages from all the CIOs and purchasing managers and all these big companies. And it\u2019s literally like, \u201cHi! I am from big bank X and we already have like 600 people on GitHub and we want to buy an enterprise license. Who do we call and where do we send the check?\u201d And they just had the email queue up this, and they didn\u2019t have \u2014 they weren\u2019t \u2014 like it\u2019s just sitting there.</p><p>And so we are working with them to help them build out the sales and marketing capability to be able to really go get all that business.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: And that\u2019s how it will make a billion dollars a year?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Well, I don\u2019t know, we will see how. I mean, aspirationally, yes. It should be a very big business. Historically companies in that market have been very successful. Big one, Rational is a big company that IBM bought a while back that\u2019s in the same market.</p><p>And then even companies, Mercury Interactive was a big company that HP bought that was in a similar kind of market. And then in the old days you had companies like Borland and Lotus that were very big in these markets. So this is sort of the new version of all that. So if it works it should be very \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s working, so it should be very big.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>So we are watching the collapse of Zynga and Groupon and LivingSocial in the consumer space. Where is the bloodbath going to be, if there is one, in the enterprise space?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> I don\u2019t know. Probably in the second and third tier. I mean, usually when you have a funding boom, categories usually get overfunded.</p><p>So probably it\u2019s in the second- and third-tier competitors. We actually get yelled at for this a lot, but we really believe it. So the big technology markets actually tend to be winner take all. There is this presumption \u2014 in normal markets you can have Pepsi and Coke. In technology markets in the long run you tend to only have one, or rather the number one company in \u2014 the number one company in any consumer products \u2014 cars, the number one company in cars is, I don\u2019t know, Toyota or whoever it is.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: I think it\u2019s Toyota.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Fifteen percent or 18 percent market share. The number one soft drink has only 60 percent versus Pepsi, but like what is Coke as a percentage of all drinks, it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, maybe 10 percent.</p><p>The big companies, though, in technology tend to have 90 percent market share. So we think that generally these are winner-take-all markets. Generally, number one is going to get like 90 percent of the profits. Number two is going to get like 10 percent of the profits, and numbers three through 10 are going to get nothing.</p><p>And the problem is, of course, there is too much venture capital, and so companies three through 10 still get funded. So there are probably lots of sort of second- and third-tier companies that are getting funded right now that won\u2019t succeed, but that won\u2019t have anything to do with whether or not the winner succeeds.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>Which is all the venture capitalists \u2014</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong>\u00a0Well, the venture capitalists who are successful in investing in the winners will be very happy with this. The venture capitalists who are investing in the losers will be very sad. But everybody will get freed, because at some point there will be a bunch of companies \u2014 a bunch of startups that will go bankrupt, and then everybody will say, that must mean the whole sector is going down.</p><p>I just think people get confused. People get confused about \u2014 it\u2019s really funny watching the stock. Like the stock market does this all the time. It\u2019s like one Internet advertising company will have a bad quarter and the other Internet advertising companies\u2019 stocks will all drop.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: It\u2019s tethered.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Maybe, but maybe it\u2019s because the other ones are now taking market share away from the one that had a bad quarter. So I find the markets all have trouble processing cause and effect in the short-term and people get all confused.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: What is the solution to that? It\u2019s so perplexing.</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> That\u2019s permanent. I think it\u2019s permanent. I think it\u2019s human nature. There are certain things that can\u2019t be fixed, and I think that\u2019s one of them.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: One would argue that the enterprise has come back into fashion, because the market is cooling on the Instagram deal being a billion dollars and now being $700 million. The market is cooling on all these photo-sharing apps and just ways to update your friends about your whereabouts.</strong></p><p><strong>Is the only reason the enterprise is sexy because it actually makes money and has results, or is there some overlaying tide of innovation that\u2019s happening that\u2019s exciting people simply because it\u2019s culture-changing?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> I think it\u2019s all the above. I think the changes are real. The businesses are good, which is nice. And then I think it\u2019s also sector rotation. We talk to a lot of the big hedge funds, mutual funds. It\u2019s really funny. We are talking about big hedge funds, mutual funds, about six months ago they all started saying, well, you know, we really think there is going to be a rotation from consumer and enterprise, and we are going to really get ahead of that. And I am like, yeah, you and 10 other guys in the last two weeks have told me the same thing. It\u2019s like, good job, you are way out ahead on the leading edge on this.</p><p>I get to the point where I am just like \u2014 my running joke has been, it\u2019s like little kids, like everybody out of the consumer pool, everybody into the enterprise pool. So everybody out of the waiting pool, everybody into the hot tub.</p><p>What happens when you have capital flowing in a rotation is, if all the capital starts to leave one sector and go to another sector, then all the stock prices rise in the sector that all the capital is going into, because everybody is buying those stocks.</p><p>And then everybody says, wow, look at how much those stocks are going up. We should invest in those stocks. And so the up cycle starts perpetuating.And the down cycle similarly \u2014 a lot of reasons people have been selling out of the consumer stocks is because they have been going down, because people have been selling out. So the cycle is perpetuating.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: So what should the smartest entrepreneur do? You have $1.2 billion to spend. Where are you spending it?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Investing. So the smartest entrepreneurs I think generally ignore all this. We really look for the entrepreneurs who don\u2019t pay any attention to this. We really look for the entrepreneurs who say the following, they say: \u201cI have this really good idea and I know it\u2019s a good idea for the following eight reasons, and I have thought about it and I have worked in the field, and I know what I am doing, and I have talked to the customers and I have figured it out, and I am going to do it. I am just going to flat-out do it. And I am going to do it whether you fund me or whether you don\u2019t fund me or I don\u2019t get funded. I am still going to do it.\u201d That\u2019s the entrepreneur we are looking for.</p><p>Sometimes that entrepreneur is in a sector that\u2019s completely dead, and that entrepreneur is going to say, I know that everybody thinks that this sector is just dead, and in fact that\u2019s probably why now is a good time for me to do this \u2014 is because I am not going to have very much competition.</p><p>Well, so a lot of these companies you talk about now, like Workday and GitHub and Box, got formed and funded when everybody thought enterprise was dead. Just like the consumer companies like Facebook and Twitter got funded and everybody thought the consumer stuff was dead.</p><p>So sometimes you get the entrepreneurs who are actually counter-cyclical. They are doing it precisely because nothing else is happening in that sector, and that means the big opportunities are just wide open.</p><p>On the other hand, sometimes you get the entrepreneurs who say, \u201cI know I am doing the 36th workforce collaboration system in the consumer side; Google was the 36th search engine, and I know it\u2019s 1999, and I know the whole sector is overfunded, but I have a better idea. I know how to do it better, I know how to do it different. I have learned from the mistakes that everybody else is making, and I am going to be the winner.\u201d</p><p>And so we will fund either one. We fund companies in the hot sectors and we fund companies in the not-hot sectors. The only difference is the pricing, and the pricing varies basically by like 4x. But what we have just found or what we have sort of tried to learn from history is you can\u2019t \u2014 for what we do you can\u2019t really time the stuff. And the last thing you want to do is look at what\u2019s happening in the public market today. And this is the thing that\u2019s weird about how venture capital works \u2014 a lot of venture capital investments are decided based on whatever the NASDAQ is doing.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis:</strong> <strong>Are you seeing down rounds because the NASDAQ is down?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> No, we have not seen down rounds yet. We have not seen down rounds yet, but consumer rounds that are happening now \u2014 consumer growth rounds are happening now at 2-4x lower prices than they were six months ago.</p><p>And the enterprise pricing is up a lot. Enterprise pricing a year ago was probably half what it is today. Maybe a third in some cases, and that made us happy at the time, but it\u2019s all good.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: Last question \u2014 your top five enterprise cool kids?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> I think they are all on your list.</p><p><strong>Alexia Tsotsis: They are on my list?</strong></p><p><strong>Marc Andreessen:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p>", "title": ["Marc Andreessen On The Future Of Enterprise"], "author": ["Alexia Tsotsis"]},

The Mitt Romney U.S. Presidential campaign, for example, got an earful earlier this year when it was revealed that he had\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/09/fake-twitter-accounts-mitt-romney\">thousands of fake Twitter followers</a>\u00a0\u2014 but Zac Moffatt, digital director for Romney\u2019s campaign, last week <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/romney-digital-director-zac-moffatt/\">told</a> an audience at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco that the campaign \u201chad nothing to do with that.\u201d</p><p>The whole concept of figuring out fake followers for famous and not-so-famous brands and people has even become something of an online pastime, with sites like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/24/find-out-how-many-fake-twitter-followers-you-have-with-statuspeople/\">Fake Follower Check</a> from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fakers.statuspeople.com/Fakers/V/1\">StatusPeople</a> revealing all sorts of embarrassing numbers.</p><p>On the other hand, there are a number of companies that are promoting the idea of paying you to tweet. Companies like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adly.com/\">Ad.ly </a>work with celebrities, while others like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://izea.com/\">Izea\u2019s</a> Sponsored Tweets tap into a wider range of influencers to promote brands. Companies like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://paidpertweet.com/\">PaidPerTweet</a> cast their nets even wider, with remunerations coming in the form of straight cash but also\u00a0coupons and other promotions. The targets range from tweets, to \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cshares\u201d on Facebook, to favoriting brands\u2019 YouTube videos to push them up the charts.</p><p>Not all of these make it clear when people are effectively behaving as walking billboards, rather than expressing their own opinions.</p><p>That lack of transparency is not going to go down well longer-term, says Gartner. It predicts that while the space is unregulated today, at some point consumer organizations are going to start weighing in. In the next two years, it says, at least two major Fortune 500 companies will find themselves under investigation by the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. over fake ratings and reviews. There has been a precedent here: in 2009 the FTC said that positive reviews posted without full disclosure of compensation (if it\u2019s there) can be prosecuted as a case of false or deceptive advertising.</p><p>The rise of paid social media endorsements comes with the fact that people are spending a lot more time online on these platforms, and brands are desperate to tap into user-generated content as the most valuable kind of endorsement of all. They also don\u2019t want to be left out of the crazy scaling that some of these sites are seeing: Facebook for example is now at around 1 billion users and still growing fast.</p><p>\u201cWith over half of the internet\u2019s population on social networks, organisations are scrambling for new ways to build bigger follower bases, generate more hits on videos, garner more positive reviews than their competitors and solicit \u2018likes\u2019 on their Facebook pages,\u201d writes Jenny Sussin, a Gartner senior research analyst.</p><p>Although the FTC is taking a stand here, it\u2019s imperative that the platform operators \u2014 Twitter, Facebook, and more \u2014 to also do something. After all, they also want to be making money from advertising alongside the content; if they don\u2019t get the balance of ads to real content right, the whole business model could end up in jeopardy. That\u2019s all the more critical considering that, as Gartner notes, public trust of social media is already fairly low.</p><p>Still, we\u2019re not at a tipping point yet for people completely discrediting social media sites altogether because of rampant fake tweets. \u201cIf you think the reviews are fake how can you trust a social site? When do we hit the tipping point when we stop trusting social media sites?\u201d he asks. I counter with the fact that people will simply begin to cut down their interactions only to trusted sources. It could make these huge sites seem a whole lot smaller in that sense.</p><p>Meanwhile, another class of social media marketeers appears to be emerging: those who are helping with \u201creputation defense\u201d: that is, rather than flooding sites with paid endorsements, rising to the task of making sure the negative critiques are complemented by interaction and response (oh, and positive reviews) in a slightly more organic way.</p>", "title": ["Reality Check: 10-15% Of Brands\u2019 Social Media Fans, Likes And Reviews Will Be Fake By 2014, Says Gartner"], "author": ["Ingrid Lunden"]},

Runners will remember early Garmin GPS watches that looked like bulbous alien egg sacs on your wrists while even the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/Omate\">Omate</a> wrist computer still looks like an unlanced polyp. But almost everyone else \u2013 <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/Pebble\">Pebble</a>, Basis, and the like \u2013 have created devices that are one step above the thinness and usability of an old Casio calculator watch. And that\u2019s a compliment.</p><p>Now, I dare say, Samsung has upped the game.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/gear/gear2_features.html\">Samsung Gear 2</a> is the company\u2019s latest smart watch and it works with a number of Galaxy smartphones. It is a Jack-of-all-trades and features a bright AMOLED screen, responsive notification and control system, and a number of fitness features that could (if the watch were generally compatible with all Android phones) put <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/Fitbit\">Fitbit</a> out of business. And the best part? It looks and works like a normal watch.</p><p>Here\u2019s why this is important: wrist real estate has traditionally been used by either bracelet like devices that act as adornments (and more recently notifiers) but watch shaped devices have always been very difficult to sell, especially if the functionality is limited. Except in very few cases, for example, I find the Pebble to be more of a distraction than a tool. Pressing a button to wake it up or getting rattled\u00a0by a buzzing notification breaks you out of the normal interaction paradigm that has been familiar to humans for a hundred years. The space on my wrist dedicated to time-telling is a sacred space that requires the user to either accept a watch as a watch or make a number of very jarring compromises.<br><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002504\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/img_3034.jpg?w=670&amp;h=466\" alt=\"IMG_3034\" width=\"670\" height=\"466\"></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002503\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/img_3035.jpg?w=670&amp;h=458\" alt=\"IMG_3035\" width=\"670\" height=\"458\"><br>\nNow that I\u2019ve gotten my personal rant out of the way, let\u2019s see how the Gear 2 stacks up. First, it\u2019s always ready as a watch. It\u2019s waterproof, to a degree, and can stand a bit of rain or even a run under the sink. Don\u2019t go swimming and you\u2019ll be fine.</p><p>In terms of battery life, I got about three days of sparse use but your results will probably vary. Exercise use will wear the battery down quickly but basic notifications do little to drain the watch. The camera is pretty good \u2013 good enough for a watch \u2013 but it\u2019s definitely not the main attraction. The watch pairs quickly and easily with compatible Samsung phones and Bluetooth LE handles all the communication. It is a very intuitive system.</p><p>Then there\u2019s the excellent interface. As a watch, the Gear 2 wins. Thanks to a few accelerometer tricks the watch lights up as soon as you need it and tends to stay dark when you don\u2019t. Your phone can send notifications to the watch or you can mute them, essentially disabling distractions. To access various features you swipe along the face and the first screen includes contacts and notifications, the second apps and music controls, the third tools including voice memo and a built-in remote control, and finally health and fitness apps like the pedometer and heart rate sensor. A small LED sensor on the back of the watch can sense your heart rate with some accuracy although it\u2019s not good for folks in a hurry. Samsung recommends you stay still and not talk while the sensor is active, which puts a damper on off-the-cuff heart rate sensing.</p><p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><p>The question then is not whether I\u2019d recommend this watch if you have a Galaxy S5 \u2013 I would, and without hesitation. It\u2019s some of the most amazing engineering to come out of Samsung in a long time. The waterproof case, the long battery life, and excellent responsiveness make it a winner and if you own an S5 I\u2019d wager that you\u2019ll be more pleased with the Gear than the phone itself. The Gear 2 looks like a solid watch that doubles as a wrist computer.</p><p>The question <em>is</em> whether you should enter the Galaxy ecosystem just to pick this up. I\u2019m not certain. Pebble still has a lot going for it if you\u2019re looking just for notifications and there are many, arguably less feature-packed solutions that can offer heart rate sensing and health data. This is Samsung\u2019s walled garden. Make no mistake. Rail against others in this space all you want, but Samsung knows that it needs to lock down the Gear 2 as much as possible and I suspect it will remain thus for the foreseeable future. That said, if you\u2019re in the market for a phone and watch combo, it\u2019s a nice garden to wander. As a mechanical watch lover I could see the value in wearing this over a ticking hunk of steel and I honestly think it it\u2019s a solid improvement over the original Gear. Should you make the switch? That\u2019s up to you and your wrist.</p>", "title": ["Samsung Goes For Another Round In The Wearables Ring With The Gear 2"], "author": ["John Biggs"]},

A large plank of the strategy is aimed at harmonizing data protection rules across the EU \u2014 which arguably will be a boon to businesses, certainly to startups, who are unlikely to have the resources to comply with multiple legal regimes across all the different EU Member States. But the EC also wants to give EU citizens\u2019 more control over their data, including granting people the right to have data that companies and organisations hold on them deleted on request \u00a0(a so called \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019), and a right to have their data ported to another service. Data holders must also notify service users of serious data breaches \u2014 \u201cif feasible within 24 hours\u201d.</p><p>The new rules will apply to any companies and organisations processing EU citizens\u2019 data, even if they are entirely based outside the EU.\u00a0To enforce the new rules, the EC is proposing to strengthen independent national data protection authorities \u2014 including giving them the ability to fine companies up to \u20ac1 million ($1.27 million) or up to 2 percent of their global annual turnover for violating the\u00a0EU data protection rules.</p><p>Little wonder Facebook is lobbying the Commission hard on key portions of the proposals.

{"date": ["2012-06-06"], "text": "<p>It\u2019s that time again. Well, who are we kidding? It\u2019s always time for iPhone rumors. This one, however, seems to be the rumor that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/17/reuters-agrees-the-next-iphone-will-be-larger/\">just won\u2019t quit</a>. So will the next-gen iPhone have a larger display? According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/06/06/apple_expected_to_upgrade_next_gen_iphone_display_to_4_with_169_ratio___report.html\">AppleInsider</a>\u2018s supply chain source, Mingchi Kuo (an analyst with KGI), all signs point to yes.</p><p>He expects the iPhone to be taller, and switch from a 3.5-inch 4:3 display to a \u201c4.08-inch in-cell IPS panel screen with a display resolution of 1,136 x 640 and 500-nit brightness,\u201d at an aspect ratio of 16:9. If this is true, Apple will actually be lowering the bar for its Retina display status. The pixel density for the rumored display is 320 ppi, whereas current iPhone models sport a ppi of 326. Obviously this isn\u2019t a huge drop, but I think it\u2019s worth noting the concessions Apple may or may not be making to keep up with the competition (read: Android phones).</p><p>This stands to be the biggest change to the iPhone\u2019s design to date, rivaled only by the jump between the 3GS and the iPhone 4, if it turns out to be real. That said, there\u2019s quite a bit Apple will have to consider.</p><p>The company insists on ease-of-use as a cornerstone of every product. The major complaints with large screens is that they kill battery life and make one-handed actions more difficult. Apple won\u2019t have this, which is why a 4-inch display is somewhat believable. It rubs right up against that \u201ctoo big\u201d line, which in my opinion sits at 4.3-inches. And even a 4.3-inch display is too big for some, but 4 inches should be comfortable to everyone from teenage girls to Occupy Wall Street protestors to lumberjacks. (You know, Apple\u2019s core demographic.)</p><p>Now, Apple already gets an earful when it comes to battery life. Competitors are kind of kicking ass in the battery department when weighed against the iPhone (at least, lately). The Droid Razr Maxx: 3300mAh battery. The HTC Evo 4G LTE: 2000mAh battery. The Samsung Galaxy S III: 2100mAh battery. Granted, the Evo 4G LTE and the Galaxy S III are much larger devices, with 4.7-inch displays.</p><p>But the iPhone 4S? 1420mAh battery. And this report suggests the same story for the iPhone 5: ~1400mAh.</p><p>According to Kuo, there\u2019s a point at which a display requires a \u201cvisibly larger\u201d battery capacity, and that point is around 4.3-inches. However, if we assume that Apple will toss in a 4G LTE radio this time (which makes sense considering it\u2019s now a proven technology, within the iPad no less) then Apple sticking to a ~1400mAh battery seems a bit off. Obviously a compromise between size and usability must be made, but battery life is one of the most important specs on a phone, so it\u2019s at this point that I feel the research may be a bit misguided.</p><p>But let\u2019s move on anyways.</p><p>Kuo also mentioned that the horizontal resolution would stay the same, at 640 pixels. This is to make sure legacy apps are still usable on the display, and also help app developers save on adapting their apps for a different aspect ratio. So, according to Kuo, legacy apps would be pillar-boxed if they aren\u2019t optimized for the longer display, but if developers want to refine the apps for the new display they won\u2019t have to tamper much with horizontal resolution, just vertical.</p><p>Just take a look at this image pulled from the research note:</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/iphonedisplay-120606-2.png\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/iphonedisplay-120606-2.png?w=640&amp;h=384\" alt=\"\" title=\"iphonedisplay-120606-2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-566934\" height=\"384\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p>Finally, Kuo made the somewhat unrelated point that he finds it \u201cnot likely\u201d that the purported leaked cases we saw last week, the ones <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/29/think-of-the-docks-could-the-new-iphone-have-a-microusb-connector/\">with microUSB ports</a> instead of 30-pin ports, are real.</p><p>Kuo has been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/18/mass_production_of_apples_a5__qualcomm_powered_iphone_5_rumored_for_sept_.html\">spot-on before</a>, so I\u2019m swallowing this report with only a moderate serving of salt. Plus, we\u2019ve seen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303360504577407610487811698.html\">this rumor sprout up</a> just about everywhere. But it\u2019s also worth noting that Jobs swore against any display larger than 3.5-inches.</p><p>We won\u2019t know anything for sure until Apple unveils the next iPhone, but we\u2019ve seen this \u201cbigger display\u201d rumor pop up over and over again, so I suggest you go ahead and brace yourself for it.</p>", "title": ["Size Matters: Supply Chain Whispers Hint At 4.08\u2033 16:9 Display On iPhone 5"], "author": ["Jordan Crook"]},
{"date": ["2012-12-13"], "text": "<p>I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here, but my guess is if you went around and asked people in the startup community what they thought about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mike-maples\">Mike Maples</a> at Floodgate, they would describe him as a sensible and successful entrepreneur turned investor and someone you\u2019d most likely be thrilled to have on your team. In my personal opinion as an investor, I think he makes some pretty sound investment decisions. His previous bets include Modcloth, Chegg, CoTweet, Formspring and an early investment in Twitter.</p><p>Given all of this sensibility, you might imagine my eyes popped a bit when the Blueseed founders <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/max-marty\">Max Marty</a> and Dario Mutabdzija got in touch to tell me that Maples joined their team by investing in the first closing ($300k) of their $700k seed round. I mean, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-thiel\">Peter Thiel</a> is known for investing in unusual and big ideas like space travel (SpaceX), sea platforms (Seasteading Institute) and the like, so if you heard about Peter getting involved with something in this arena, you wouldn\u2019t bat an eyelash.</p><p>Just in case you missed the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/10/the-real-pirates-of-silicon-valley/\">buzz last year</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blueseed.co/\">Blueseed</a> is a company that is looking to create a sea platform about 30 minutes off the shore of Half Moon Bay. The platform will host startups from around the world that are looking to be close to the magic of Silicon Valley, but for various reasons surrounding immigration red tape, they can\u2019t have their offices located in the U.S. yet.</p><p>Peter had originally offered to lead this round as a personal investment. However, as part of a new agreement with Founders Fund shortly thereafter, Peter no longer does seed investing outside of the fund. I reached out to Founders Fund and verified this change. Although Peter is personally incredibly passionate about Seasteading and believes in it, it wasn\u2019t a good investment match at this stage for Founders Fund. I talked to Max and Dario about this and they are hopeful that Peter and his team will renew their interest later on down the road once they have more traction.</p><p>I think, for whatever my thoughts are worth, that Maples and Floodgate add a whole new dimension and legitimacy to this endeavor. I mean, I\u2019m a huge Peter Thiel fan. Peter naturally gets and supports a different way of thinking and problem solving. He consistently believes in the impossible. It is much harder to convince someone that\u2019s not like Peter (and very few people are like him in this world) that this is a viable option. This is, without a doubt, an incredibly hard venture. Mike Maples acknowledging that and deciding that he too believes it is worthwhile, well, that\u2019s a huge milestone. Peter just seems like low hanging fruit. Maples is a very tall Christmas tree topper. As big of a fan of Peter as I am, I\u2019m even more impressed they landed Floodgate.</p><p>I reached out to Mike Maples to find out what his thoughts were on Floodgate\u2019s investment and he responded:</p><p>\u201cFloodgate has invested in Blueseed because we think it is critical to find new ways to empower the smartest and most talented people in the world to come together to build great companies without being encumbered by archane work visa restrictions. We want to be part of the solution however we can and we love the Blueseed team\u2019s willingness to tackle this problem in a totally original and ambitious way.\u201d</p><p>Also joining Floodgate are Correlation Ventures and two investors (Xu Xiaoping and Wang Qiang) from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://501.hicloudsoft.com/meworksv2a/meworks/page1.aspx?no=600\">Zhenfund</a>, who are based in China. If you are building something international, it is good to get buy in from, well, folks who aren\u2019t here.</p><p>I was also able to reach Correlation Ventures and here\u2019s why they invested:</p><p>\u201cCorrelation Ventures is very pleased to be joining Floodgate and the rest of the syndicate in backing Blueseed\u2019s highly committed and passionate management team. We applaud Blueseed\u2019s plan to offer a unique and innovative approach to accessing the most relevant elements of the Silicon Valley start-up ecosystem to world-class entrepreneurs from around the world.\u201d</p><p>With cash in hand now, I had to wonder how far the founders have progressed. Blueseed now has more than 1100 individuals from 336 companies and 64 countries who have applied, several committed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blueseed.co/partners/\">partners</a> including <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pillsburylaw.com/\">Pillsbury Law</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fenwick.com/pages/default.aspx\">Fenwick &amp; West</a>. They plan on using this seed investment to work on policy and work out all of the nitty-gritty details they will need to have tackled before leasing a ship. Once they get to that stage, they will seek a much larger round of financing.</p><p>A lot of people reading this article might not quite understand the market need for a sea platform, so I asked the team to share some of the applicant\u2019s feedback on why they want to leave out on the open ocean.

Now, to be clear, I love my new <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/11/iphone-4s-review/\">iPhone 4S</a>.  I <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/15/watch-me-talk-to-my-iphone-4s-siri-demo/\">talk to it</a> even when there isn\u2019t a human on the other end of the line.  Sometimes it talks back.  But one thing that literally sucks about my iPhone 4S is its battery life.  And I\u2019m not the only one <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3391947?start=0&amp;tstart=0\">complaining</a>.</p><p>Today, my iPhone died after about 8 hours\u2014not even enough to get me through a full day without recharging (and this is typical).  This was not 8 hours of constant use (unless you count the constant pinging of notifications, which may be the culprit).  It was 8 hours total from the time I unplugged it in the morning and took it with me until the screen went black at around 4 PM.  According to the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html\">specs</a>, the iPhone 4S is supposed to get 200 hours of standby time, 8 hours of talk time, and \u201cup to 6 hours\u201d of Internet use on 3g.  During the day, I made half a dozen calls less than 5 minutes each, used the Internet for an hour on the train (email, Twitter, light Web browsing), and then maybe another 90 minutes throughout the day.</p><p>So that comes to a total of 2.5 hours of Internet usage and 30 minutes of phone calls.  The rest, in my mind, is all standby.  Except maybe it isn\u2019t since the phone is constantly bleeping with notifications and emails.  And that may very well be the problem.  There are many theories out there, but the ones which ring true to me are that notifications and location-based apps are the big battery drains.</p><p>The iPhone 4S has a really great new notification center where you can see recent notifications from all your apps with an always available pull-down screen.  I have about a dozen apps that feed into that notification center, including Facebook, Twitter, Yammer, Skype, Google+, Foursquare Instagram and text messages.  I have an equal number with location-based services turned on.  Sure, I could turn these off and I probably will.  But what\u2019s the point of having a  state of the art mobile computer in your pocket if you have to disable its best features?</p><p>No, what I\u2019d like instead is for Apple to fix this mess.  I don\u2019t know how, perhaps through an update or new rules imposed on app developers.  Maybe limit the number of times an app can ask for a location update when it is dormant.  Or if notifications are the problem, make it easier to manage which notification you get by app.  I don\u2019t need to know every time somebody likes one of my Instagram photos or tries to add me as a friend on Facebook or Foursquare.  I could cut out more than half of my notifications\u2014and maybe a big chunk of the battery drain\u2014if there were better granular controls to mute the noise.  Better yet if there is a technical solution Apple can impose and I don\u2019t have to do anything.</p><p>Battery life is one of those things you don\u2019t notice until you don\u2019t have it anymore.

The payments platform, based on technology acquired from LoopPay, gives Samsung what it hopes will be a competitive advantage in the payments market, as it\u2019s not limited to NFC-based payments alone.</p><p>Instead, Samsung Pay offers a way for consumers to pay using\u00a0their Samsung smartphones\u00a0via either NFC technology, like Apple and Google\u2019s solution, or by emulating a magnetic stripe card. The latter item was the basis for Samsung\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://recode.net/2015/05/13/samsung-paid-around-250-million-for-looppay-its-apple-pay-competitor/\">$250 million</a> <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/18/samsung-acquires-looppay-maker-of-an-apple-pay-competitor/\">acquisition of the startup LoopPay</a>, which had developed and patented a technology called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.looppay.com/how-it-works/\">Magnetic Secure Transmission</a>.</p><p>Though the U.S. is shifting to EMV-based credit and debit\u00a0cards, which are more secure that the traditional magnetic stripe cards, there will still be a transitional period where not all customers\u2019 cards have been upgraded to the chip-and-PIN technology, and not all point-of-sale terminals will support EMV transactions. In other words, magstripe transactions will stick around for some time.</p><p>That, Samsung hopes, will give\u00a0its mobile payments service the edge in the near-term. And as payment terminals move to support EMV and NFC technology instead, Samsung Pay will continue to work with them, too.</p><p>While Apple iPhone users and NFC-based Android smartphone users today\u00a0have to check to see if their terminal supports NFC transactions before they can tap their phone to pay, with Samsung Pay-enabled smartphones, tap-and-pay works at nearly any point-of-sale terminal where you can swipe your card to pay thanks to its support for magstripe card emulation.</p><p>However, Samsung\u2019s solution is not without its challenges. For starters, the payment technology is only enabled on select devices \u2013 the\u00a0Galaxy S6, S6 edge, S6 edge+ and Note5 devices. (It will also support NFC on Samsung Gear S2 devices in select countries in the future.) Competitor Android Pay, meanwhile, works on nearly any NFC-enabled Android phone running Android 4.4 (KitKat) or higher.</p><p>In addition, Samsung hasn\u2019t forged a deal with Verizon, one of the U.S.\u2019s top carriers, which means Samsung Pay for now only works on AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular\u2019s networks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung Pay is launching in partnership with a number of financial partners, including American Express, Visa and MasterCard, as well as Bank of America, Citi and U.S. Bank. But, out of the gate, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.android.com/pay/\">Android Pay works with</a>\u00a0those partners as well as Discover and a number of other banks and issuers, including Capital One, Navy Federal Credit Union, PNC, Regions, USAA and Wells Fargo. And rival\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204916\">Apple Pay\u2019s list of supporting banks</a> is even more extensive than either of these newer Android solutions.</p><p>In other words, Samsung Pay will be more limited in terms of the number of U.S. customers it can reach at launch. And then, those supported customers who know about the service and understand how it works will be even fewer, as consumer adoption of mobile payments is still heating up.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1216109\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-28-at-12-54-02-pm.png?w=680&amp;h=324\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-28 at 12.54.02 PM\" width=\"680\" height=\"324\"></p><p>For those with Samsung Pay-enabled\u00a0phones, using the system is fairly simple. To make a payment, users swipe up, scan their fingerprint and then pay \u2013 similar to how Android Pay works.

One of the more recent efforts is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.onecitysf.org/home/initiatives/sf-citi-circle-the-schools/\">Circle the Schools</a>, a program that was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/19/circle-the-schools/\">launched</a> last autumn to help pair employees and companies in the tech industry with schools that they \u201cadopt\u201d and then offer assistance where it\u2019s needed, whether it\u2019s in an obvious area like offering computer science presentations or tutoring, or chaperoning field trips.</p><p>Programs like these\u00a0are definitely useful, but also sit alongside much thornier issues, such as the civic regulatory\u00a0hurdles that a lot of tech companies are facing as they grow, which\u00a0potentially threaten their business models.\u00a0One case in point\u00a0are those businesses built on the so-called \u201csharing economy\u201d model, where ordinary people and their assets are the basis of goods and services marketplaces.</p><p>The accommodation startup\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.airbnb.com\">Airbnb</a> came up as one notable example. While it\u2019s disrupting the hotel industry with its private\u00a0hiring\u00a0platform, it\u2019s also playing an unlikely role as potentially highlighting just how untenable and costly the larger permanent housing issues are in markets like San Francisco and New York.</p><p>Right now the company could be facing caps on how many nights its hosts can accept for a specific property, a state of affairs\u00a0that both Conway and Wilson thought was misguided.</p><p>\u201cThe notion that Airbnb\u00a0is part of the problem is completely false,\u201d Conway noted. \u201cIt\u2019s just a part of the argument from \u2026\u00a0people\u00a0who don\u2019t understand the sharing economy.\u201d</p><p>He also took issue with the proposal of capping the numbers of days that a host can let out a room or residence. \u201cI just think it\u2019s a false ceiling. Why should the government be involved in that?\u201d</p><p>But one area where the pair disagreed was on the subject of data.

His conclusion: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done there hasn\u2019t been big enough.\u201d</p><p>Initially, Decrem says he wasn\u2019t even planning to release a <em>Brave</em> game, because he didn\u2019t want to do another mediocre movie tie-in, and there wasn\u2019t enough time to do something better. Meanwhile, he\u2019d become interested in Temple Run\u2019s success, and it was the Imangi team that was excited about combining Temple Run and Brave.</p><p>The Disney mobile team brought a group tech journalists to Pixar headquarters last week to show off the game (as well as 30 minutes of <em>Brave</em> the movie, which looks fun, gorgeous, and more Disney-like than any of Pixar\u2019s past films). If you\u2019ve played Temple Run, the game mechanics will be pretty familiar \u2014 you run through the forest, jumping, sliding, and dodging around obstacles, while also grabbing coins. However, the setting has been changed from an ancient temple to the Scottish forest, and instead of playing an explorer being chased by evil monkeys, you take control of Brave\u2019s protagonist Merida as she flees from the \u201cdemon bear\u201d Mordu. There\u2019s also a new archery feature, where you can fire your bow at targets for extra points as you run.</p><p>After Decrem\u2019s talk about not thinking big enough, a reskinned version of an existing game may seem like a bit of a letdown \u2014 and indeed, that\u2019s how I felt when I watched the Temple Run: Brave demo projected on the big Pixar screen. However, it\u2019s a proven and quite addictive game mechanic. (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/15/temple-run/\">Temple Run was the #1 free iOS app for a while</a>, and it currently has 16 million daily active users) And when I tried the game out for myself, I became so absorbed in running and jumping that I actually dropped the iPad. (Yes, I\u2019m a klutz.)</p><p>A couple of the filmmakers behind Brave also stopped by the presentation and said they\u2019d worked to make sure the game\u2019s look matched the movie \u2014 for example, co-director Steve Purcell teased production designer Steve Pilcher for his need to add mist to everything. (Purcell who has a history with games, having worked on several of LucasArts\u2019 classic adventure titles, including Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road, based on his own comics.)</p><p>Temple Run: Brave will cost 99 cents \u2014 that\u2019s more than Temple Run, which is free, but Imangi co-founder Keith Shepherd says they view this as a \u201cpremium version\u201d of the game, not a replacement.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=565272\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-565272\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/temple-run-brave-screenshot.png?w=313&amp;h=450\" alt=\"temple run brave screenshot\" title=\"temple run brave screenshot\" width=\"313\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-565272\"></a></p>", "title": ["Disney Teams Up With Imangi For Movie Tie-In \u2018Temple Run: Brave\u2019"], "author": ["Anthony Ha"]},

Scary, I know.</p><p>Change is hard. Apple has used the same form factor for 4 iPhone generations spanning 5 years. The iPhone 4, and the 4S for that matter, is still one of the best looking phones on the market, with an impossibly thin design and stunning good looks. But it\u2019s time for a change.

This requires a new mobile chipset, which, as proven by the new iPad presents a new set of challenges. Instead of growing the iPad\u2019s height and width (and therefore the screen size), the new iPad was made a bit thicker to accommodate the larger battery needed to power the 4G chipset and retina display. Apple doesn\u2019t have that luxury with the iPhone. The next iPhone cannot be thicker than the current iPhone. But it can be taller.</p><p>4G chipsets are generally not as mature as their 3G counterparts. They require more power and thus require a larger battery. Instead of making the iPhone thicker, logic suggests that Apple would then make the phone a bit taller, making room for a larger, likely retina, display.</p><p>This change will likely upset the Apple diehards. As the screen size increased on Android phones, iPhone users took to Internet comments and forums to defend the smallish iPhone\u2019s 3.5-inch screen. It seems sooner versus later now, Apple will use a different screen for the iPhone.

Plus, the Gear watches are now based on Tizen OS, instead of on Android, despite very little outward changes to the OS itself.

A LoopPay app allows you to input and store payment card information, and the case communicates wirelessly with existing tap-to-pay terminals available at merchants and retailers.

LoopPay had a neat feature, letting you pay with your phone even with regular card readers. It sends special signals, and it works without NFC. Samsung Pay also supports this feature.</p><p>All these services require biometric authentication via hardware, meaning that you need to have a device with a fingerprint sensor to use Samsung Pay. That\u2019s why all the latest Samsung phones have this kind of sensor, such as the Galaxy S6, the Galaxy S6 Edge, and the newly announced Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 Edge Plus.</p><p>The other difficult part of the integration for Samsung is working with banks and payment processing companies.

The circular control allows people to tune to different genres and sub-genres, and preferences can bet tweaked further via three sliders that are called from the bottom of the interface that allow you to adjust how recently music has been released, how popular it is and how closely it aligns to your preferred track history.</p><p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><p>You can also create your own stations using artists and albums you like, check out curated collections arranged by others, and skip up to six songs per hour, per individual station.

Now the #1 free iOS game, Imangi Studios reveals its <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/temple-run/id420009108?mt=8\">Temple Run</a> has hit 20 million downloads and 7 million DAU. Co-founder Natalia Luckyanova tells me how by designing Temple Run to be fun without having to pay, it became the top grossing iOS game despite only 1% of users monetizing.</p><p>The first step was making a game that resonated with users emotionally. You play as an explorer running through an ancient temple, constantly chased by a pack of skull-faced monkeys. This seems to trigger the latter half of the human fight or flight response. Luckyanova tells me tweets and word of mouth about how terrifying the monkeys are have helped Temple Run go viral.</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/temple-run-screenshot1.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-482853\" title=\"Temple Run Screenshot\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/temple-run-screenshot1.png?w=315&amp;h=365\" alt=\"\" width=\"315\" height=\"365\"></a>\u201cWe wanted to make Temple Run feel like it was designed for iOS rather than ported from a console, where you\u2019re using virtual joysticks\u201d Luckyanova\u00a0says. Temple Run can be played using just one hand, with swipes and tilts controlling the player. A single run through the temple takes 30 seconds to a few minutes. This makes it easy to dip in and try to beat your high score and run past the scores of friends, creating an addictive experience.</p><p>The key to Temple Run\u2019s success is that it\u2019s free and doesn\u2019t hinge on in-app purchases. \u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to downloading it, and it can be fully played without having to buy anything\u201d. Users collect the in-game currency by picking up coins as they run, meaning they can earn any power-up or character in the store if they don\u2019t want to purchase currency.</p><p>Many games make it extremely difficult to complete the later levels or competing directly against other players if you haven\u2019t paid. In contrast, Temple Run focuses on an accessible user experience that boosts retention and sharing, with just 1% choosing to pay. This allowed it to become the top grossing iOS game through massive traction, instead of topping out around 1 million DAU with 4% monetizing like other games.</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/keithnataliakirilsmall.jpeg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-482855\" title=\"KeithNataliaKirilSmall\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/keithnataliakirilsmall.jpeg?w=600&amp;h=401\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\"></a></p><p>Founded in 2008,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.imangistudios.com/\">Imangi Studios</a> was one of the first developers in the App Store.

We\u2019re trying to keep it going by updating the game on a regular basis with new power-ups and characters to keep people engaged.\u201d</p><p>Rather than bring complication in-house, Imangi has partnered with another developer to build out Temple Run for Android.

The 16GB model will cost $199, while the 32GB model will set folks back $249, and it seems as though everyone else is following suit.</p><p><strong>Sprint: </strong>The carrier will start selling the Galaxy S III on June 21, and pre-orders will begin on June 5 (i.e. tomorrow) for the truly ambitious. They\u2019re sticking to the $199/$249 pricing structure as well, though there\u2019s a bit of bad news if you\u2019re looking to score a 32GB model \u2014 they\u2019ll only be available online (for now, anyway).</p><p><strong>T-Mobile:</strong> The magenta-hued carrier has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20120604005701/en/T-Mobile-Debut-Samsung-Galaxy-III-June-21\"> announced</a> that they will launch the Galaxy S III on June 21 like Sprint. No word on pre-orders or price, though I\u2019d reckon the $199/$249 is pretty much a done deal across the board at this point.</p><p><strong>AT&amp;T:</strong> A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.att.com/galaxysiii/?#fbid=HlJz3o_w9Gi\">teaser page </a>for the Galaxy S III went up overnight for eager consumers to peruse, but they haven\u2019t had much else to say on the topic just yet.

Swampy, the game\u2019s reptilian hero, is the first original character that Disney has developed <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/22/with-swampy-the-alligator-disney-takes-aim-at-the-angry-birds-empire/\">specifically for a mobile platform</a>. </p><p>The company still has high hopes for Where\u2019s My Water, not only because it\u2019s the company\u2019s first original IP for the mobile space, but also because of what its success means for Disney\u2019s vision for the mobile gaming experience. According to Disney Mobile GM Bart Decrem, more and more \u201cguests\u201d \u2014 Disney\u2019s name for their consumers \u2014 are turning towards smartphones and tablets as their primary source of entertainment. </p><p>Disney\u2019s new job then is to create compelling stories and characters that fit not only onto smaller screens, but also into more hectic lifestyles.</p><p>\u201cWe want to create engagements within the span of a minute,\u201d he said. That isn\u2019t to say that those engagements should lack depth: most Where\u2019s My Water levels can be completed in around a minute, but Decrem\u2019s team has added secrets and easter eggs to reward users for spending more time with the game.</p><p>I\u2019ve alluded before to the fact that Where\u2019s My Water was never intended to stay <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/22/with-swampy-the-alligator-disney-takes-aim-at-the-angry-birds-empire/\">solely on the small screen</a>, and Decrem confirms that the multimedia push is coming.</p><p>Swampy\u2019s popularity both inside and outside Disney has paved the way for his migration into other media. According to Bart Decrem, Where\u2019s The Water merchandise will soon see the light of day, and Disney.com and YouTube will be partnering up for a string of Swampy backstory videos. He offered no specifics on when that multimedia push will kick off, but he did mention in passing that he appreciates Rovio\u2019s sense for \u201cdoing things at the right time.\u201d</p><p>That could be the rationale behind the company\u2019s recent announcement: Disney wants to push Where\u2019s My Water into a whole new set of eyes today with the release of a <a href=\"http://ow.ly/85xHn\">free version of the game</a>. Far from just being a trimmed-down \u201clite\u201d version of the original app, Disney Mobile instead designed ten new levels for the free version, and will be rolling out another ten as a promotional campaign over the next few days. </p><p>As it turns out, the decision to design a free version from the ground up was an easy one for the team to make. Decrem feels that \u201clite\u201d versions of games are tacky and too focused on the upsell. Developers should focus on creating quality products without business considerations \u2014 your mileage may vary on that one, but it\u2019s a formula that he ultimately feels led to a better product. For a company that has looked to mobile as an incubator for new IPs, keeping those burgeoning franchises in people\u2019s minds can be crucial.</p><p>So what\u2019s next for Disney Mobile? They\u2019ve got at least one more original IP that will debut on Android and iOS next year, and Decrem says he wants to create a \u201chow did they do that?\u201d experience. If Decrem and Disney Mobile can prove that the mobile space can help nurture new brands, Rovio may have to keep their eyes peeled. Everyone wants to claim their crown, but Disney may have enough money and manpower to really do it. </p>", "title": ["Disney\u2019s Bart Decrem On \u201cWhere\u2019s My Water?\u201d And Their Approach To Mobile"], "author": ["Chris Velazco"]},

There\u2019s now a <a href=\"http://secretlondon.onefinestay.com/\">holding page</a> and Twitter account (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/secret_london\">@secret_london</a>) as Secret London morphs into a full-blown startup.

Philippou (who remains Admin of the group) says people are posting information not just on what to do and where to go but simple things like their favourite park benches and undiscovered art galleries.

And let\u2019s not forget <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/\">Time Out</a>, which has long thought itself the arbiter of London\u2019s secrets.</p><p>The explosion in the SL group is reflective of the generation online now.

The previous model, called the Galaxy Gear, was powered by Android, but this time around Samsung opted for the alternative operating system of Tizen.</p><p>Samsung also released an SDK for its hot Gear Fit device \u2014 a wearable many are declaring could be the first true smartwatch. Since the Fit is focused on fitness, this SDK is especially important. Samsung clearly hopes third-party developers will be able to churn out applications and uses for a mainstream audience. Another SDK was released focused on the S Health functions found in many of the company\u2019s devices.</p><p>To become successful, consumer electronic devices are increasingly reliant on a successful ecosystem. Consumers are not buying a device these days. They\u2019re buying into a world centered around a device. This is most evident with GoPro and its thousands of third-party accessories or an Android/iOS device backed by their respective robust app libraries. Even the Pebble smartwatch has a deep development pool, which is one of the reasons for its success. Samsung needs the same for the Gear.

That could be a problem for <em>Avengers Alliance</em>, since a game about superheroes would probably skew male. But during the beta test period, when the game was played by tens of thousands of users, it actually saw 45 percent more viral installs compared to most Playdom titles, and in fact men were four to six times more likely to send in-game messages.</p><p>\u201cAt first we thought it was a logging error,\u201d Lee says. \u201cHonestly, that completely baffled us at first.\u201d</p><p>Eventually, however, the team decided that the data was accurate.

That men will embrace social game mechanics, as long as they\u2019re built around \u201cstrong [intellectual property] and a game that people love.\u201d Lee says that after the official launch on Thursday, the virality stats even improved (presumably because the marketing attracted a lot of serious Marvel fans).</p><p>The early results, Lee says, bode \u201cextremely well for Disney, as they have whole strongest IP in the world.\u201d</p><p><em>Avengers Alliance</em> is also the first game that Playdom has built using intellectual property from its parent company Disney, which also owns Marvel.

The Gear 2 could present itself as aspirational, with the Gear Fit looking like the intelligent, affordable alternative.

{"date": ["2012-09-05"], "text": "<p>Chapel Hill, NC-based <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://splitmo.com/\">Splitmo</a> is a brand new company looking to build a business on an emerging trend: dual screen content consumption. The startup debuted its first app today, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/air-show-hd/id531930785?mt=8\">Air Show</a>, a universal app for iPad and iPhone that gives users greater control over their photo slideshows as broadcast wirelessly using Apple\u2019s AirPlay or via a tethered HDMI connection.</p><p>But wait, doesn\u2019t Apple build that right into iOS? It is true that Apple allows playback of on-device photo libraries to AirPlay-capable devices like the Apple TV, and gives you some control over how that will look. But Air Show is designed to take better advantage of what the iPhone and iPad can provide for the presenter, letting them preview, choose and even make changes to\u00a0upcoming\u00a0images before they\u2019re displayed on the big screen.</p><p>\u201cOnce you view pictures on a big screen TV, it is hard to view them\u00a0elsewhere,\u201d explained Splitmo founder Rob Witman in an\u00a0interview. \u201cThat being said, the current options for doing so are very poor. That includes the native Photos app, as it isn\u2019t designed to take\u00a0advantage of two unique screens. We recognized that if we designed something from scratch with that goal in mind, it would be a great way\u00a0to both showcase the benefits of having two unique screens and at the same time produce something that was useful and currently missing.\u201d</p><p>The editing and captioning aspect is what really makes Air Show different than other comparable offerings, and Witman says that actually came about as a later feature addition following initial user testing. The team noticed that many of its testers wanted to make small adjustments to images after the fact as they were already in slide show mode, things they neglected to spot when working on photos in Lightbox or editor software.</p><p>Photos are a first step, and one that Splitmo is hoping to make money on using a freemium model where users get a full basic product for free with the ability to save up to three shows at\u00a0once, but are charged $5 for unlimited shows. On the horizon, however, the company sees much more opportunity beyond slide shows ahead for dual screen technology, hence its broader overall focus.</p><p>\u201cMobile devices have fantastic input capabilities and lots\u00a0of power, but even tablets have minimal screen real estate,\u201d Witman said, discussing the potential he sees for the broader market. \u201cWhen you get in a group, this really becomes a limiting factor. Considering\u00a0how our devices talk to shoes, security systems and other random gadgets, it only makes sense that they should be intricately connected to\u00a0the largest possible display device, the home television.\u201d</p><p>Once that happens, Witman believes we\u2019ll see the consumer opportunities open up plenty of doorways to new applications in the education and business markets. But while it\u2019s true that consumer tech trends have a way of making their way back to enterprise and institutional users, dual screen viewing has yet to experience its Dropbox moment of user adoption.</p><p>Bootstrapped Splitmo is hoping to find the right mix to help it achieve that, with a plan to try a variety of different approaches to split screen experiences. The company is also realizing that this will require more funding, and is looking to close a seed round before the holidays to help with that. While Air Show may not be the app to break down the floodgate to wider dual screen tech adoption by consumers, it at least shows an effort to tackle the problem from a different perspective.</p>", "title": ["Splitmo Building Apps For The Future Of Dual Screen Viewing, Tackles Slide Shows First"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},

Since then, the company has been busy expanding the number of publishing partners who use its polling widgets, which in turn has dramatically increased the number of users taking its polls, which makes its data all the more valuable.</p><p>Now it has raised an additional $2.86 million from Boston-based New Atlantic Ventures, as well as big media publisher Cox Enterprises. Along with the investment, New Atlantic founder and managing partner Todd Hixon will be joining the startup\u2019s board. And Cox has begun deploying CivicScience polls across its digital properties. </p><p>CivicScience\u2019s polling platform works like this: Publishers can license its platform for free, and plug its polls into their websites through a widget or API. Once in place, CivicScience collects data from all the various users who take those polls on third-party websites, social networks, or mobile platforms. Sounds simple enough, but in addition to poll answers, CivicScience also collects a fair amount of anonymous user data, which allows it to adapt to the user. That also lets it provide very deep analysis of user sentiment and trends in the market. </p><p>The startup then takes that data and sells it to a number of third parties. That includes brands, advertisers and political groups who use the data to measure the effectiveness of their ads, messaging, or campaigning efforts. It also includes financial institutions and research firms that use the data to pinpoint emerging trends for their own clients.</p><p>CivicScience hopes to provide value to both publishers and its research clients: On the one hand, CivicScience provides deep analytics and audience measurement tools to publishers, who can use that data in its negotiations with advertisers to increase CPMs. On the other side of the equation, CivicScience has a platform to provide syndicated and custom research from the data it collects from its partner sites.</p><p>Cox\u2019s interest in the startup is strategic, as it will be rolling out CivicScience polls across its network of sites and also will be a client of its research services. Cox joins media companies like Scripps Digital, McClatchy, Hearst, the NY Daily News, and hundreds of other web publishers.</p><p>UPDATE: CivicScience has a history of putting out hilarious press releases. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://about.civicscience.com/blog/2012/7/14/tech-company-suffers-dilution-at-hands-of-new-investors.html\">Here\u2019s the latest</a>.

As <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/10/east-of-palo-altos-eden/\">I wrote about last month in a very long and through history</a>, a lot of this has to do with unjust\u00a0land-use and local government policies from the past 70 years.</p><p>Today, Facebook\u2019s headquarters sits right on the Menlo Park and East Palo Alto border, and the city has shifted toward a\u00a0Latino majority from its historically black roots. It is one of the last bastions of affordable housing on the peninsula.</p><p>As Facebook\u00a0rocketed toward a multi-billion dollar IPO, Cox stayed\u00a0involved in East Palo Alto.\u00a0When one of his\u00a0bandmates, Justin Phipps, partnered with other community leaders to\u00a0teach music and college readiness to children in after school programs a few years ago, Cox helped them pay for space and a studio in a house that\u00a0used to be\u00a0a Black Power\u00a0elementary\u00a0school in\u00a0the 1970s.</p><p>\u201cIt\u00a0started from my musical relationship\u00a0with\u00a0him,\u201d Phipps said. \u201cBut now\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0been\u00a0cemented into an\u00a0actual partnership with\u00a0the community.\u201d</p><p>Cox has never been very public about his commitments, but now he\u2019s giving $1 million to Phipps\u2019 organization\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.liveinpeace.org/\">Live in Peace</a>.</p><p>\u201cThis is something that we wanted to announce to shine a light on philanthropy that is local,\u201d\u00a0said Cox.</p><p>Cox is aware that one million\u00a0dollars isn\u2019t enough to address the city\u2019s mounting challenges with affordable housing and gentrification, but he\u2019s worked with\u00a0Live in Peace for so\u00a0many years that he knows they provide something valuable to the city.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard because it\u2019s so pressurized and it\u2019s such a big problem. I don\u2019t pretend that this is the whole solution to everything,\u201d Cox said. \u201cBut when you find something where you know the people are good and the organization is good, paying attention to that is the right thing to do even without knowing the whole answer.\u201d</p><p>With Stanford students Shadi Barhoumi and Rafael Cosman, Live in Peace\u00a0recently opened <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/streetcodeLIP\">Streetcode Academy</a>, which teaches programming, mobile app development and Arduino to students\u00a0at\u00a0the campus of an old remedial school.</p><p>It\u2019s a holistic\u00a0approach.

It\u2019s this whole other spirit and energy.\u201d</p><p>Phipps, Sobomehin and Heather Starnes, another community leader who has been involved in East Palo Alto for almost 30 years, are using the money to pay for staff and teaching salaries so Live in Peace can continue to offer free music and technical\u00a0education to youth in the city.</p><p>Cox\u2019s donation comes at a time when other young tech leaders are trying to figure out how to deploy their wealth in a philanthropic way. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which houses some of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s charitable funds, has ballooned in size, growing from $4.7 billion in holdings at the end of 2013 to $6.5 billion\u00a0at the end of last year. This was in part because other moguls like Whatsapp founder Jan Koum and GoPro CEO Nicholas Woodman have established donor-advised funds there. (Donor-advised funds are vehicles for\u00a0permanently setting aside capital for philanthropy when\u00a0you\u2019re younger, even if you don\u2019t know exactly what you want to commit it towards.)</p><p>While Cox is\u00a0emphasizing his local giving, other tech leaders\u00a0need to find their own way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to criticize anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to take their time to figure it out.

That\u2019s a huge vote of confidence for asm.js and it\u2019ll likely mean that far more developers will now take a closer look at this technology.</p><p>\u201cOver the last few months we\u2019ve taken a close look at asm.js as a technology, related technologies, and what they entail for the Web at large. While challenging to write by hand, asm.js is leveraged principally by transpiling C/C++ code to run on the Web platform, utilizing technologies such as WebGL and Web Audio,\u201d the Chakra team <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2015/02/18/bringing-asm-js-to-the-chakra-javascript-engine-in-windows-10.aspx\">writes</a> today. \u00a0\u201cAsm.js is a clear step towards enabling near-native performance for the Web platform, which is why we\u2019re excited to bring it to Chakra in an upcoming release.\u201d</p><p>The main idea behind asm.js is that developers will compile their C/C++ code into this optimized subset of the JavaScript language (using the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/kripken/emscripten\">Emscripten compiler</a>) that the browser can then execute. Developers could, of course, also write their own asm.js-compatible code, but that\u2019s necessarily the focus of the project.\u00a0In its current form, asm.js\u00a0code\u00a0runs about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/asm-js-performance-improvements-in-the-latest-version-of-firefox-make-games-fly/\">1.5x slower</a> than the same C/C++ code.</p><p>This makes it significantly\u00a0easier to port mobile and desktop games (where the code base for the original desktop or mobile game was likely written in C anyway) to the browser. Without asm.js, you\u2019d likely see quite a bit of stuttering in these games.\u00a0Because the code is still completely standard JavaScript, it will also still run on in any other browser \u2014 just not as fast.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1121300\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/benchmarkgraph_windows.png?w=800&amp;h=475\" alt=\"BenchmarkGraph_windows\" width=\"800\" height=\"475\"></p>", "title": ["Microsoft\u2019s JavaScript Engine Will Soon Support Mozilla\u2019s Asm.js"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},

Now a mobile advertising startup called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.silvrpush.com\">SilverPush</a> says it has created the most accurate approach yet.</p><p>Making those connections is particularly important for advertisers because of the lack of cookies for tracking user behavior on mobile. As a point of comparison, Kleiner Perkins- and Sequoia-backed Drawbridge says it examines behavior on multiple devices and uses statistical models to suggest when multiple devices are being used by one person. (The company recently <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/03/drawbridge-video/\">expanded into video ads</a>.)</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/silverpush\">SilverPush</a>\u2018s approach, as explained to me by co-founder and CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/hitesh-chawla\">Hitesh Chawla</a>, sounds both\u00a0simpler and more complicated.</p><p>Basically, the company says it uses \u201cultrasonic inaudible sounds.\u201d If you\u2019re browsing the web and encounter a SilverPush advertiser, then at the same time that they\u2019re dropping a cookie on your computer, they also play one of those sounds. You won\u2019t be able to hear it, but if you\u2019ve installed any app that uses the SilverPush software development kit, it will actually be listening for that sound in the background, and when it detects an \u201caudio beacon,\u201d it\u2019s able to identify that your desktop/laptop computer and your phone/tablet belong to the same person.</p><p>I pointed out that this could be pretty creepy, since it sounds like there\u2019s an app listening in the background on your phone or tablet. Chawla acknowledged that there\u2019s a risk of negative public perception, but he said that SilverPush isn\u2019t receiving any actual audio data \u2014 once a match has been made, the only thing that gets sent back to the company is the identification code linking the devices. Chawla also said he\u2019s working with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mmaglobal.com\">Mobile Marketing Association</a> to develop guidelines around using this technology in a way that respects users\u2019 privacy.</p><p>I also asked if there are potential obstacles to making a match. For example, my loud apartment air conditioner was blaring during the call, so I wondered if that might interfere. Chawla responded that noise shouldn\u2019t be an issue. The biggest obstacle, he said, is distance; it won\u2019t work if the devices are too far away.</p><p>He added that some SilverPush advertisers (including Procter &amp; Gamble and messaging app Line) are already using these capabilities, as are \u201ca few\u201d mobile publishers (mostly game developers). It works on both iOS and Android and could potentially be used in TV ads, too.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geektime.com/2014/04/07/indian-silverpush-raises-1-5m-with-plans-to-grow-in-the-u-s/\">SilverPush announced earlier this year</a> that it had raised $1.5 million from IDG Ventures, 500 Startups and others.</p>", "title": ["SilverPush Says It\u2019s Using \u201cAudio Beacons\u201d For An Unusual Approach To Cross-Device Ad Targeting"], "author": ["Anthony Ha"]},

I will point out, however, that $45 million seems like a pretty low valuation for a company that has raised a total of $20.5 million in funding. Plus, raising $14 million at that valuation would mean giving away a lot of the company. Since Drawbridge is a young startup that only raised its Series A and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/15/drawbridge-ad-targeting-products/\">launched its first products last year</a>, it probably isn\u2019t so cash-strapped that it needs to take money on such unfavorable terms.</p><p>Drawbridge isn\u2019t commenting on the valuation, but it did note that it\u2019s now working with advertisers, including HotelTonight, Square, Groupon, Kabam, and PocketGems.</p><p>The company\u2019s approach to ad targeting focuses on trying to identify cases where multiple devices are being used by a single user, so that mobile ads, in particular, can be targeted using the richer data collected from cookies on the desktop web.

After Telegram\u00a0was briefly booted\u00a0from the Google Play store after a\u00a0sticker-related spat with messaging app Line, a major distributed denial of service attack\u00a0hit Telegram\u2019s\u00a0servers over the weekend, leading to a loss of service concentrated\u00a0in Asia.</p><p>Now some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/brucewagner/status/619930512652550144\">believe</a> Telegram could\u00a0be the next messaging app to provoke the ire of China and face a block in the country.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://telegram.org/blog/ddos\">Telegram claimed</a> the DDOS attack left users of its service in Asia Pacific experiencing \u201cslower connection speeds or no connection at all for several hours\u201d over the weekend on Monday. That\u2019s because, the organization claimed, it witnessed\u00a0a surge in traffic that hit\u00a0200 Gbps \u2014 \u201cwhich feels roughly like having 200 billion very random people squeeze into your bus every second,\u201d Telegram explained on its blog.</p><p>The company, which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://telegram.org/blog/2-billion\">delivers more than two billion messages</a>\u00a0each day and claims <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/13/telegram-says-its-hit-62-maus-and-messaging-activity-has-doubled/\">62 million month active users worldwide</a>, said its service was down for five percent of entire user base globally, and 30 percent of traffic affected in Asia specifically.</p><p>DDOS attacks are notoriously difficult to track and near impossible to attribute to specific culprits. Telegram believes that the attack \u2014 which seems fairly sophisticated since it was evenly distributed across thousands of servers \u2014\u00a0\u201cis being coordinated from East Asia\u201d.</p><p>For those who aren\u2019t aware, Korea is the home of messaging apps Line and Kakao Talk. Telegram claimed Friday that Line filed a complaint related to the use of stickers in the Telegram Android app. Google removed the Telegram app from the Play Store, only to return it hours later once the issue had been settled.</p><p>Line declined to comment on its apparent complaint\u00a0when asked for details by TechCrunch. While the company may have objected to Telegram using its IP, it\u00a0seems unlikely that the company coordinated the DDOS attack itself.</p><p>Someone in China seems\u00a0a more likely attacker.\u00a0That\u2019s because, during its\u00a0sticker skirmish,\u00a0Telegram picked up a little notoriety of its own in the world\u2019s most populous country.</p><p>The service\u00a0was labeled an \u201canti-government\u201d tool in a Sunday article in\u00a0state-run mouthpiece/newspaper Peoples Daily [<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fpolitics.people.com.cn%2Fn%2F2015%2F0712%2Fc1001-27290030.html&amp;edit-text=\">Google Translate link</a>].\u00a0That label was applied after\u00a0the service was reportedly used by a set of human rights lawyers who were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-locks-up-the-lawyers-1436738563\">arrested by the government on Friday</a>.

Tencent-owned WeChat is too large to be shut down, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/20/us-tencent-censorship-idUSKBN0KT0WM20150120\">it is subject</a> to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/06/10/tencent-closes-20-million-wechat-accounts-in-china-linked-with-prostitution/\">regular \u2018clean ups\u2019</a>.

Let them block.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s an interesting position for\u00a0Durov, who helped\u00a0create Telegram in the wake of censorship controversies in Russia, and then left the country altogether when those\u00a0issues\u00a0began to intensify. It seems he prefers to lead by example rather than direct confrontation.</p><p>Ultimately, Durov\u00a0may be\u00a0right and there\u2019s no clear sign of who is behind the attack, however we know that China\u2019s attitude to internet censorship has changed.

(According to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://concord.bbb.org/article/one-ring-phone-scam-on-the-rise-45629\">BBB</a>, calls are connected to paid international adult entertainment services, or other premium services located outside the U.S.)</p><p><img class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-963508\" alt=\"Call-List\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/call-list.png?w=346&amp;h=680\" width=\"346\" height=\"680\">The WhitePages Current application was already working to ID unknown numbers, including those from known scammers, but the company today announced that it has now added over 20,000 new scam numbers directly tied to \u201cOne Ring\u201d and similar scams. When these numbers dial your phone, you\u2019re alerted with an immediate notification which reads \u201cpossible fraud or spam.\u201d This is displayed on the screen during the incoming calls.</p><p>You\u2019ll also be able to be alerted to suspicious numbers in the app\u2019s recent call history, which is helpful since \u201cOne Ring\u201d scammers generally hang up quicker than you can answer.</p><p>And finally, the app will offer a prominent warning if you\u2019re about to place an outbound call to a number with a high spam score \u2013 in case you miss all the other notifications, and are just really, <em>really</em> hoping that your missed call is from that guy or girl you met at the bar last night.</p><p>The \u201cOne Ring\u201d scam is actually fairly clever, since it relies on the fact that many consumers now take a phone call quite seriously.

{"date": ["2013-03-28"], "text": "<p>More and more shopping is happening online, thanks to the low cost and convenience of having products delivered directly to users. But that is happening at the expense of big national retail chains, which are having a difficult time keeping up with online competition. A new startup called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deliv.co/pages/home\">Deliv</a> hopes to provide retailers with a new way to please tech-savvy shoppers by offering same-day local delivery for the same price \u2014 or less \u2014 than having items shipped.</p><p>It\u2019s probably no surprise at this point that the growth of e-commerce is causing a major headache for big brick-and-mortar retailers. Companies like Walmart and Target are seeing some of their business disappear as shoppers skip shopping in stores, choosing the convenience of online retail and free shipping from services like Amazon Prime.</p><p>To combat this, most have opened up their own online shops and even offer the option to purchase online and pick up in store. Deliv wants to use the infrastructure that those retailers have already built and take things one step further by enabling consumers to have all the same convenience of online shopping, but add same-day delivery into the equation.</p><p>Rather than having consumers pick up in store, Deliv would simply have one of its own delivery people make the drop products off for them. But the beauty of Deliv is that, unlike traditional delivery options, the startup uses a crowdsourced model for finding people to deliver packages for it. According to Deliv founder and CEO Daphne Carmeli, that enables it to have a flexible number of people available to make deliveries at any time.</p><p>Funny how things work out: The news about Deliv\u2019s funding comes as there are reports that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/28/us-retail-walmart-delivery-idUSBRE92R03820130328?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews\">Walmart is looking to offer its own crowdsourced delivery</a> option. I circled back with Carmeli to see if they were working together or if her startup was working with Walmart on these plans, but have yet to hear back. For what it\u2019s worth, Walmart is also looking at <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/walmart-follows-amazons-lead-starts-testing-locker-delivery-in-retail-stores/\">testing locker deliveries</a> as it searches for ways to compete with Amazon Prime\u2019s free two-day shipping.</p><p>And let\u2019s not forget about Google, which just today began testing its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/google-starts-testing-google-shopping-express-today-in-sf-free-delivery-at-target-walgreens-staples-and-more/\">Shopping Express delivery option</a> with retailers such as Target, Walgreens, and Staples in the San Francisco Bay Area. Oh yeah, and then there\u2019s stuff like Postmates Get It Now app, which you can use to get whatever you want delivered from pretty much any store in San Francisco and Seattle.</p><p>Carmeli says one advantage that Deliv has is its ability to turn up new markets very fast. While Google is in testing mode in one market and Postmates is slowly working to scale city-by-city, Deliv thinks that it can have new markets up and running within weeks. That\u2019s because it mainly relies on the infrastructure already built by retail partners for purchase and pick up in store.</p><p>Another advantage is that Deliv gives users flexibility around where they might want to have things delivered. While other on-demand delivery options promise items in less than an hour, not everyone needs that. In fact, Carmeli argues that in most cases, convenience trumps speed. In other words, being able to have a package delivered after work at your home or at a certain hour at work is more important in most cases than getting it right away. Scheduling deliveries, as a result, is a key differentiator.</p><p>Already, the company has been testing the model in the San Francisco Bay Area, but is ready to go wide as soon as retail partners decide to turn the Deliv option on. Carmeli told me that the company has put out requests for drivers in 14 markets already, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Indianapolis, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C.</p><p>For every 5-7 workers needed, Deliv gets about 200 applications. That enables it to pick just the best, putting them through background checks before getting them on board. Once they\u2019re actually making deliveries, a ratings system enables Deliv to give priority to the highest-ranked delivery people.</p><p>Now that Deliv is ready to go, the company has raised $1 million in seed funding from investors such as General Catalyst, Redpoint Ventures, Trinity Ventures, Operators Fund, and PivotNorth. That money should help get it off the ground and enable it to keep expanding once retail partners decide to turn up services in various markets.</p>", "title": ["Deliv Raises $1 Million To Crowd Source Same-Day Local Delivery For Big Brick And Mortar Retailers"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

It\u2019ll come in gold, silver and black finishes for its stainless steel body, and will also offer a built-in heart rate monitor, 4GB of onboard storage, 512MB of RAM, the standard loadout of motion sensors for activity and health tracking, and Bluetooth LE for device pairing.</p><p>Huawei\u2019s wearable looks to combine the best aspects of the Android Wear crowd\u2019s reigning champs, offering a perfectly circular display, with a bezel size that won\u2019t necessarily invalidate those with smaller wrists from wearing one. The company plans to launch the device in 20 countries worldwide, and it should go on sale in June of this year, though the company isn\u2019t talking price yet.</p><p>The decided factor in the Android Wear category continues to be design, and this looks frankly a lot nicer than either existing options or other new ones, including the forthcoming LG Watch Urbane.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/mwc-2015\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/wzpotci8yzjbbtpxdgbus3wcmdi5uxdznqu2ayfxrmq.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>", "title": [], "author": []},
{"date": ["2014-02-24"], "text": "<p>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is here, and now we know everything about the 2014 flagship from the Korean smartphone maker. It\u2019s pushing into phablet territory with a 5.1-inch, 1920\u00d71080 display, and it comes with a fingerprint reader on the home button, as well as a heart rate monitor around back near the camera flash. The Galaxy S5 is also dust and water resistant, which may be the most useful new feature to ship on the phone.</p><p>Samsung\u2019s Android 4.4-powered flagship doesn\u2019t deviate that far from its predecessors in terms of case design, packing the larger screen into a larger chassis but sticking with a plastic (though there is a higher end metal variant) backing, rounded corners and a pill-shaped home button, but the fingerprint scanner and heart-rate sensor are significant hardware additions. The Galaxy S5 also seems to have a significant focus on health and fitness with this update, which could preface a similar move with the next generation of iOS software and hardware.</p><p>On the new Samsung phone, the heart rate monitor will track your pulse and provide that info in S Health 3.0, Samsung\u2019s fitness monitoring app, which already tracks steps taken and calories burnt. An optical heart rate monitor that works with your fingertip also appears on the new Galaxy Gear 2 smartwatches. For those who are curious about the inclusion of such a feature, Withings ships a step counter with a built-in monitor, which adds another dimension to health tracking and can be used in combination with other data to give a clearer picture of overall health.</p><p>The other big new hardware feature here is the fingerprint sensor. Many will no doubt accuse Samsung of copying Apple once again, but the fingerprint sensor here is quite different from Apple\u2019s on the iPhone 5s. It can register three separate fingerprints, and registration takes eight swipes (it\u2019s swipe-based, rather than asking you to hold your fingerprint down as with Apple\u2019s). You can unlock the phone using fingerprint recognition, but also use it to authorize PayPal to make payments online \u2013 for anything. That\u2019s much wider-reaching than Apple\u2019s usage of fingerprints, which is limited to unlocking and to finalizing purchases made via iTunes.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-962941\" alt=\"Lifestyle_02\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lifestyle_02.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\">Since it\u2019s using PayPal, that means this could be used to pay for physical goods at retail, too, which potentially opens up a lot of mobile payments options for Samsung. All will depend on how easy the fingerprint tech is to use in practice, however, and how resistant it is to attempts to foil or dupe the security system.</p><p>The finger swipe can also unlock Private Mode on the Galaxy S5, which provides access to content that a user would rather keep hidden from anyone else who might gain access to their phone, like kids and strangers. It\u2019s a handy and much-needed addition to mobile, which so far hasn\u2019t had any really easy way to limit access to on-device media and content selectively.</p><p>Another highlight of the Galaxy S5 is the new camera, which now offers 16 megpixels on the rear \u2013 and video capture of 4k resolution (even though the screen on the device itself can only manage 1080p, or one quarter of that). The Galaxy S5 isn\u2019t the first phone announced to have 4K video capture capabilities, but it is part of a limited early group, and that\u2019s something that might be more appealing to consumers now that 4K TVs are becoming more affordable and consumers are looking around for content sources: at this rate, home videos could beat broadcast TV to the punch.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-962932\" alt=\"Lifestyle_04\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/lifestyle_04.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\">The new camera also has a slow motion function like in the iPhone 5s, as well as post-capture refocus selection, like in the expensive and cumbersome Lytro light field camera. This is another feature that should make its way to many mobiles this year, but it should definitely help Samsung sell some smartphones to shutter-happy mobile photogs.</p><p>There\u2019s also hybrid autofocus, which includes both contrast detection and phase detection, which is the same kind of system used in advanced DSLRs and mirrorless digital cameras. Samsung promises this autofocus will be able to lock on in as few as 0.3 seconds, making it the fastest ever for a smartphone.</p><p>Other specs for the Galaxy S5 include a microSD slot for expanding storage (which could work with the newly announced 128GB capacity for iPhone-beating storage) and a Download Booster software feature that combines LTE and Wi-Fi data connection for superfast downloading of larger files, though at the expense of your mobile data bandwidth. The rugged design means you can take it anywhere, but you\u2019ll have to deal with a flap for the Micro USB 3.0 charging/power port on the bottom.</p><p>It packs a 2.5GHz Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, NFC, LTE, Bluetooth 4.0, and either 16GB or 32GB of storage, so no real surprises here. It does offer a black and white mode for power saving (and promises up to 10 hours of LTE web browsing or 12 hours of video playback), which is interesting, and it should go on sale on April 11 in a first crop of almost 150 countries according to Samsung.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/mwc14/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/mwc14-event.jpg\"></a></p>", "title": ["Samsung\u2019s Dust- And Water Resistant Galaxy S5 Gets Official With Heart Rate Monitor, Fingerprint Scanner"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},

Notably, they have tripled the price of many titles. Librarians across the country are expressing their discontent.</p><p>The changes were telegraphed by an announcement a month ago that suggested prices would be going up soon, and most expected significant increases \u2014 but across the board popular genres and titles have gone up as much as 300%. Nothing is offered below $25, and some common titles are going for above $100.</p><p>As Kathy Petlewski, a librarian in Plymouth, <a href=\"http://kpetlewski.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/random-house-friend-of-libraries/\">puts it</a>: \u201cThe first thing that popped into my mind was that Random House must really hate libraries.\u201d</p><p>But the dismay at the major increase in prices is tempered by a sort of desperate gratefulness that the publisher is willing to play ball with libraries at all. The other big publishers have been less than generous: HarperCollins\u2019 e-books <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/18/good-for-them-halifax-library-refuses-to-carry-drm-limited-harpercollins-e-books/\">\u201cexpire\u201d after 26 uses</a>, Hachette and Macmillan only make part of their list available, and others like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/23/penguin-shuts-down-libraries-access-to-new-e-titles-on-amazons-kindle/\">Penguin</a> and Simon&amp;Schuster don\u2019t allow library lending at all. So Random House, in a way, is the gold standard right now. They even make the library books available on the day they first go on sale.</p><p>(Incidentally, The Digital Shift has a great page <a href=\"http://www.thedigitalshift.com/2012/02/ebooks/a-guide-to-publishers-in-the-library-ebook-market/\">describing publishers\u2019 policies on this topic.</a>)</p><p><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/random_house_logo.jpg?w=640&amp;h=273\" alt=\"\" title=\"Random_House_logo\" width=\"640\" height=\"273\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-512245\"></p><p>And despite the obvious ugliness of charging obscene amounts for the purpose of making books available to the public, one can see that the publishers\u2019 backs are against the wall. Any concession at all is to be, if not admired, at least understood as a difficult and possibly disastrous course of action.</p><p>These companies are faced, after all, with the prospect of selling one book and having it lent to a hundred people at once (though that is not the case here), never get stolen or damaged, be easily duplicated, and so on. In a way, the idea of having e-books \u201cexpire\u201d or selling them at a significant markup is easily understood. They have to do something to make the new market at least partially reflect the old one. Should libraries and readers reap all the benefits of the digital revolution in publishing? They certainly don\u2019t think so, but that doesn\u2019t make them right.</p><p>It\u2019s rare, however, that a technology or idea only benefits one side of the equation. With e-books, the big publishers can rid themselves of much of the overhead their business entails. They can reach more markets and deliver things faster. But to take advantage of this without conceding anything to the other side is an unrealistic hope that they have nevertheless cherished.</p><p>The libraries are the victims today, but let us not forget that the publishers are the victims every day. The difference is the libraries are the victims of the publishers, but the publishers are the victims of progress. Which is going to give up first?</p><p>Hopefully it won\u2019t be the libraries. They are underfunded and often underutilized, but they are still <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/112698/California-Dreamin#4183210\">an extremely valuable social service</a> and should not be mischaracterized (as they often are in tech) as anachronisms. They will be changing form over the next decades, but the institution of the public library has existed for thousands of years, and will endure, though it may change. Big publishing houses, however, are a fairly modern invention and are perhaps more likely to become extinct.</p><p>[via <a href=\"http://www.the-digital-reader.com/2012/03/02/random-house-raises-library-ebooks-through-the-roof/\">The Digital Reader</a>]</p>", "title": ["Necessary Evil?

The variant of the Gear 2 would be exclusive to the Korean market for a while, but international expansion isn\u2019t out of the question, according to the report.</p><p>This wouldn\u2019t be Samsung\u2019s first exploration of a standalone watchphone \u2013 the company had one back in 2003 that was announced and then later cancelled, with a 94\u00d764 screen and SMS capabilities. But this would be the first one to incorporate so-called smart features, and the first based on Tizen, Samsung\u2019s home spun smartphone OS which provides battery-saving advantages over Android.</p><p>Battery would be an issue that needs addressing with the Samsung Gear 2 smartphone watch, since adding cellular calling capabilities would mean its existing power usage takes a hit. Still, Samsung already improved its battery life on the Gear 2 over the original Galaxy Gear, so perhaps adding telephony services would just bump it back to around a day or so, which is in keeping with most modern smartphones.</p><p>Samsung has offered an SDK for the Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo, so theoretically a standalone version could also run its own apps, too. I still think most of the value of smartwatches is in their ability to complement the experience of a smartphone, but if Samsung can put out a Gear 2 variant that has built-in voice calling cheaply and see how users respond, it\u2019s probably not a bad idea for them to see how the market responds.

For those not familiar with Astrid, it was one of the first task and list management apps to show up on the Android Market back in 2008, where it has since become a stalwart. The app later jumped over to iPhone, the (mobile) Web and Windows Phone, helping people to complete over 30 million tasks along the way.</p><p>Today, Astrid is rounding out its iOS apps with a built-from-the-ground-up iPad app and a whole mess of premium services, like file storage, voice recordings and backup, among others. Astrid was already a solid list service, but its new round of updates bring it some essential features for taskmaster-ing on-the-go.</p><p>But more on that in a hot second. First, some quick background. Astrid\u2019s focus from the outset (since it was conceived as a side-project by a Palantir engineer) has been to offer a clean, easy-to-use interface around a simple task-sharing and collaboration service. With Astrid, users can create tasks with deadlines, set priority levels, add tasks to your calendars or to various lists, like your \u201cHome List\u201d or \u201cWork List\u201d or \u201cPeople To Kill With Kindness List.\u201d The goal of the service was to easily enable groups/businesses assign tasks to people within and broadcast to the group when completed \u2014 a bit like a mobile Asana \u2014 so users can share grocery lists, reusable checklists for every month, etc.</p><p>With its newest app, Astrid brings a now familiar feature set to your iPad. Astrid co-founder Jon Paris tells us that an iPad app has been the most-asked-for \u201ctask\u201d on the company\u2019s own to-do list, but they didn\u2019t want to simply port the iPhone app, so they designed it from the ground-up. That sounds like fluff, but you can see what he means in the user experience. The free app works as a standalone to-do list and syncs with the startup\u2019s web and iOS apps and takes full advantage of gestural control and your device\u2019s accelerometer.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-04-at-6-20-26-pm.png\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-04-at-6-20-26-pm.png?w=640&amp;h=464\" alt=\"\" title=\"Screen shot 2012-09-04 at 6.20.26 PM\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-640856\" height=\"464\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p>Users can swipe right on a task to postpone by a week, swipe left on a task to delete, shake the device to return to the home screen, swipe from the bottom edge to open a task bar, along with similar functionality in \u201ctask edit\u201d view.</p><p>While Astrid has been steadily building out the usability and functionality of its service, it\u2019s been somewhat unclear how the startup eventually planned to scale the dreaded Monetization Mountain. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/23/along-with-new-look-apps-astrid-now-lets-you-outsource-tasks-to-taskrabbit/\">Back in February, the startup added</a> TaskRabbit integration to let users outsource parts of their to-do lists to the on-demand network and integrated Google and Amazon search for a little lead-generation.</p><p>These were smart (and relatively cool) features, but today the startup launched a more realistic and potentially more sustainable approach to monetization: Premium services. And thankfully, they\u2019re not just slap-dash features thrown together to make a buck on the \u201cpremium label,\u201d these are things that will actually bring a boost to your productivity on iOS devices.</p><p>The premium service will cost $4.99/month or $39.99/year via in-app purchase and offers file storage so users can attach files from iOS or from the web app with drag-and-drop uploading (anyone who\u2019s shared on the task list can view the files, Premium subscriber or not), voice recording so that users can attach voice notes to tasks and automatic voice backup. This last bit is pretty helpful given the unpredictability of speech-to-text, especially when you\u2019re moving, as the app saves a recording of your voice and attaches it to the task whenever you open voice dictation in the app.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-04-at-6-20-46-pm.png\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/screen-shot-2012-09-04-at-6-20-46-pm.png?w=207&amp;h=300\" alt=\"\" title=\"Screen shot 2012-09-04 at 6.20.46 PM\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-640857\" height=\"300\" width=\"207\"></a>How often do you think of something you need to do while you\u2019re on the move or away from your computer and don\u2019t have time to jot or type it down? For me, it happens surprisingly often. Voice dictation and backup obviously solves a huge problem there and it\u2019s great when lives inside a list and management service. Will be especially great until Siri gets her act together.</p><p>The premium subscription also adds a pro dashboard with interactive charts, custom filters and web themes, which come in handy when you want to track progress on personal or team projects or edit groups of tasks simultaneously.</p><p>All in all, some solid updates for Astrid, as it continues to push forward.</p><p>For more, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://astrid.com/\">find Astrid at home here.</a></p>", "title": ["Astrid 2.0: Productivity Assistant Comes To The iPad With Voice Recording, Premium Service"], "author": ["Rip Empson"]},

Facebook might also add such frequency suggestions to its Ads API, making tools built on top of it know when to stop a campaign or sub in a new targeting parameters or ad creative.</p><p><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/brad-smallwood-facebook-measurement.png?w=545&amp;h=269\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brad Smallwood Facebook Measurement\" width=\"545\" height=\"269\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-664447\"></p><p>The optimal frequency could vary widely across industries, products, or even specific ads. Facebook could teach a food brand that after a person sees an ad for a new cereal 5 times, paying to show them the same ad again doesn\u2019t increase sales of the cereal. That means once it hits a frequency of 5 on the first audience targeted, it should expand to show ads to a wider audience, or cook up a new headline or image for their promotion.</p><p>This all comes as part of <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/facebook-brad-smallwood-datalogix/\">a larger narrative Facebook is trying to drive home: Clicks aren\u2019t king</a>. Since people generally buy cereal in a grocery store, just because ad viewers aren\u2019t clicking through to a brand\u2019s website or Facebook Page doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not being influenced by the ad impressions.</p><p>Facebook isn\u2019t a direct click-through-and-buy-online advertising platform like Google. Facebook wants the marketing world to know its ads influencing buying habits, even if days or weeks later. That sets it up to suck ad spend away from a similar medium: television.</p>", "title": ["Facebook Will Use Datalogix Offline Purchase Records To Show Ads The Perfect Number Of Times"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},
{"date": ["2013-12-13"], "text": "<p>Facebook is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Retailers-Using-Custom-Audiences-Can-Now-Measure-Offline-Sales\">launching a new way</a> for brick-and-mortar business owners to measure if their Facebook ads drove in-store sales, even if customers never clicked. Businesses can buy ads, then send Facebook privacy-safe data on who bought what, and Facebook will tell them how much people who saw the ads bought compared to those who didn\u2019t.</p><p>By providing confidence in return on investment from ad impressions, Facebook could get advertisers spending more, especially on mobile where ad clicks disrupt the user experience. Plus, the info could help marketers learn what ads actually resonate with people, which in turn helps users and Facebook by making ads in the feed more relevant and less annoying.</p><p>Ad measurement might not sound super sexy, but the marketing industry is experiencing a massive leap forward in how it tracks ROI right now.</p><p>Once upon a time, marketers had little idea if their ads worked. They\u2019d buy TV or print campaigns in specific markets, and then hope to see sales lift there too. The problem was there were tons of confounding factors, and it was tough to tell if a buyer had actually seen the ad.\u00a0Online advertising changed everything. Suddenly marketers could track that a user clicked an ad that sent them to their site where they made a purchase, indicating the ad worked.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were a ton of limitations. If the ad wasn\u2019t the last click before the purchase, they were hard to tie together. That led marketers to put a premium on \u201cdemand fulfillment\u201d campaigns like search keyword ads that could be easily tracked, but this shortchanged any \u201cdemand generation\u201d ads the user saw before that might have contributed to their purchase decision. If users only saw an ad but didn\u2019t click, then bought something later, the advertiser may not have known that impression had an impact.</p><p>Google, Facebook, and others eventually began developing ways to tell if someone who simply saw an ad later made a purchase online. But that still left the connection between online ads and offline sales in brick-and-mortar stores as a big mystery.</p><p><span style=\"line-height:1.625;\">[Update: But last year Facebook began working with <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/facebook-ads-frequency/\">offline purchase data provider Datalogix</a> to track offline purchase data about how online ads influenced brick-and-mortar buying habits. Datalogix can figure out what someone bought by using data from grocery store loyalty cards and other methods. It then sells this data to Facebook, Google, and other companies so they can track to see <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/25/datalogix-offline-purchase-data/\">if spend on the advertised products increased</a>\u00a0and\u00a0tell advertisers if their ads are driving return on spend.</span></p><p>Facebook later <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/27/facebook-ad-data-providers/\">paternered with other purchase data providers including Epsilon, Acxiom, and BlueKai</a> as well as Datalogix to let brick-and-mortar businesses upload hashed, privacy-protected lists of their customers to Facebook so they can target them with ads to keep buying.]</p><p><span style=\"line-height:1.625;\">And now, Facebook\u2019s new Custom Audiences measurement could make it clear that someone didn\u2019t just stumble into a physical store\u2019s big Sunday sale, but instead saw an ad for it that inspired their visit.</span></p><p><span style=\"line-height:1.625;\"> Facebook\u2019s Vice President Of Ads Product Marketing Brian Boland tells me \u201cThis has never been done at this scale, to link digital exposure to in-store sales for anyone with a CRM system.\u201d Previously, Facebook had been privately testing the measurement tool with a select few advertisers, but now it\u2019s available to any advertiser that buys directly from Facebook\u2019s managed sales team.</span></p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-930652\" alt=\"FB graphic\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/fb-graphic.jpeg?w=680&amp;h=383\"></p><p>Here\u2019s how it works. A business collects email addresses of their customers or potential customers through online forms, requests at the register, signups for newsletters, loyalty programs, or surveys. The business then\u00a0uses Facebook\u2019s Custom Audiences targeting tool to submit the email list from their customer relationship management system in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-and-privacy/relevant-ads-that-protect-your-privacy/457827624267125\">hashed, privacy-protected way</a>, and advertise to these people on Facebook.</p><p>When a customer subsequently makes a purchase at the advertiser\u2019s physical location and swipes a credit card or loyalty card, or provides their email address again , the business can match the purchases to their email address. The business then submits an encrypted version of this sales data to Facebook. Facebook compares how much people who saw the ad bought versus a control group of people in the Custom Audience that it didn\u2019t show ads to, and reports the findings to the business.</p><p>The impact of being able to measure online ads\u2019 impact on offline sales like this is massive. \u201cI\u2019m beyond excited\u201d Boland tells me in complete monotone, Ad measurement guys aren\u2019t always the most dynamic, though, so I still believe him.</p><p>How will this change marketing? For example, an advertiser could learn that people who saw the ad spent 60% more than those who didn\u2019t. That means it\u2019s probably cost-effective to keep buying those ads. If the business runs multiple A/B tests, they could figure out which ad variant drove the most sales lift, cancel their other versions of the ad, and run more like the successful one in the future.</p><p>The ability to measure ROI of impressions, not just clicks, is especially critical for mobile advertising. On the small screen, you do one thing at a time, opposed to running multiple apps and browser tabs on the same screen on the web. That means clicking on an ad on mobile is very disruptive to whatever you\u2019re doing. You can\u2019t just pop a tab and keep browsing. That likely discourages mobile ad clicks.</p><p>But just because someone didn\u2019t click doesn\u2019t mean the ad didn\u2019t affect their buying decisions. On mobile, ads like those on Facebook often take up the entire screen. They\u2019re essentially a screen takeover. Even if you only read for a second and then scroll by, that brand name, store location, or promoted discount could stay in your brain and later get you into a store to buy something. Facebook\u2019s new measurement technology could reveal that connection.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The tool could bring in a bunch more ad revenue for Facebook. Boland tells me \u201cWe fundamentally believe that measurement drives confidence. We\u2019re moving away from proxy metrics [like clicks] to sales outcomes. As we build real measurement solutions, they\u2019ll spend more money digitally and specifically on mobile.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, some users might find the idea that Facebook \u201cknows\u201d what they buy offline to be a bit creepy. But the sales data is all encrypted so Facebook doesn\u2019t actually know who is who, and it deletes all the sales data once it\u2019s made its reports to the advertisers.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But what most people hate more is being shown crappy, irrelevant ads.\u00a0Along with more money, Custom Audiences measurement could even make Facebook\u2019s users happier. Better data on what ads work lead to more relevant ads, and more satisfied users who spend more time on Facebook. Soon, you might see fewer ads for things you never buy, and more for your favorite local stores.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Advertising is easy to hate on, but it\u2019s what lets companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter offer their services for free to everyone. And there\u2019s a big world out there full of things you might want to buy or learn, but you\u2019d never discover. At their worst, ads fracture our attention and clutter our vision. But when well-targeted and measured, ads can help curate the world for us.</p>", "title": ["Facebook\u2019s New Offline Sales Measurement Trick Could Make Ad Clicks Obsolete"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},

At the time,\u00a0Sivaramakrishnan described Drawbridge\u2019s big idea \u2014 trying to improve mobile ad targeting by collecting data about user activity on the desktop web, mobile web, and mobile apps, then using \u201cprobabilistic and statistical inference models\u201d to suggest which PC and mobile users are actually the same person using different devices.</p><p>Drawbridge has been running campaigns since September 2011, but now it\u2019s making its products more widely available, and\u00a0Sivaramakrishnan is providing more specifics about what the company is offering. There\u2019s Drawbridge for Cross Screen Marketing, which allows companies to run mobile ad campaigns that retarget their web visitors. So for example a publisher could run a mobile campaign aimed at people who visited its website and try to convince them to download the mobile app. And there\u2019s also Drawbridge for App Marketing, a product aimed specifically at mobile publishers and developers.</p><p>Sivaramakrishnan said Drawbridge is taking a different approach than most other app marketing products, because it\u2019s not just trying to drive lots of installs at a low cost. Instead, it targets ads at the audience segments that are most likely to be valuable to the advertiser \u2014 \u201cvaluable\u201d in this case could mean revenue, transactions, levels played, or whatever else the developer says is important.</p><p>Sivaramakrishnan said that Drawbridge has now matched 200 million users with their device, a number that\u2019s growing by about 4 million users per day. She argued that it was important to reach that scale before taking the products out of beta.</p><p>\u201cAdvertising products are a funny beast,\u201d she said. \u201cYou develop a product, but it\u2019s only useful if you have scale.\u201d</p><p>I feel like I\u2019ve been hearing from a lot of new mobile ad targeting startups, so I asked Sivaramakrishnan how she sees the market developing. She argued that there are really two buckets: Companies trying to deliver more data-driven ad campaigns on mobile, and companies that are \u201ctruly executing cross-screen marketing.\u201d The second bucket is really the \u201cnext frontier,\u201d Sivaramakrishnan said, and that\u2019s where Drawbridge has developed the most advanced technology.</p>", "title": ["Kleiner- And Sequoia-Backed Drawbridge Takes Its Cross-Device Ad Targeting Out Of Beta"], "author": ["Anthony Ha"]},

They charge you for the call, and for each minute they can keep you on the line.</p><p>According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://concord.bbb.org/article/one-ring-phone-scam-on-the-rise-45629\">the BBB</a>, this so-called \u201cOne Ring\u201d scam is on the rise. </p><p>Like many a ruse, this one relies on hitting many, many potential targets at once. The scammer sets up a computer to call thousands of numbers per hour \u2014 because for every 99 people who follow their gut and don\u2019t call weird numbers, there\u2019s 1 person who will. Maybe they\u2019re waiting for response on a job interview, and don\u2019t know what number it\u2019ll come from. Maybe they\u2019re hoping it\u2019s that girl from the bar last night. Maybe the number just looks kind of familiar. It\u2019s all about making mass sweeps and finding the exceptions.</p><p>The trick? <strong>They only let the call ring <em>once</em> before it automatically hangs up.</strong> One ring is enough for the number to show up on your missed call screen, but just short enough that you\u2019re not likely to answer it in time (which keeps the call from fully connecting and thus keeps the scammer from having to front for any long distance fees.)</p><p>Speaking of long distance fees: the number it\u2019s dialing from is, generally, one from outside of the US \u2014 but one that has the same country code (+1, which we share with Canada and almost all of the Caribbean nations, from the Bahamas to Jamaica), and thus looks <em>a whole lot</em> like a US number. On US premium numbers, the FTC requires the caller to explicitly agree to charges. On international numbers, the FTC has no jurisdiction.</p><p>We\u2019ve seen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"//www.att.net/smartcontrols-809AreaCode\">tricks</a> like this before, using many of the same basic concepts \u2014the sneaky international number, the hook to get you to call it back. A few years ago, a common scam technique was to text someone saying \u201cYour [relative here] is hurt, and you are the emergency contact! Call [sneaky international number here] for more information.\u201d </p><p>But this is the first time I\u2019ve seen them boil it down to a simple missed call. It plays on the ubiquity of smartphones, and that\u2026 no one really calls each other anymore. If someone is calling, it\u2019s probably important, right? Better call\u2019em back!</p><p>While reports on scams like this tend to warn you that you\u2019ll be charged a zillion dollars per second, that\u2019s\u2026 usually not the case, in reality. Carriers will often void the charges if they/you catch them, so the scammer\u2019s goal is often to keep anyone from noticing the charge. <strong>They\u2019ll charge you a few bucks to establish the call, then a few bucks for each minute they keep you on hold/on the line.</strong> </p><p>But even if they charge you nothing, there are other reasons not to call\u2019em back:</p><p><strong>How To Avoid Gettin\u2019 Scammed:</strong></p><p>tl;dr: stranger danger. </p><p>[image credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-165600752/stock-vector-social-network-hacker-stealing-data-from-file-folder-criminal-on-smart-phone.html?src=dt_last_search-5\">jesadaphorn</a> on Shutterstock]</p>", "title": ["PSA: Missed Call From A Mystery Number?

Our active users increased by 15 million in the 9 months from March 2014 to Dec 2014 (from 35m to 50m).

In March last year, Telegram said it had 35 million monthly active users, 15 million of whom used it daily, with 18 billion messages monthly, 600 million messages daily.</p><p>Telegram seems to have garnered most of its popularity in Europe, Latin America, India, Arab countries and South East Asia. It definitely got a lift when Facebook acquired WhatsApp last year, leading to concerned over messaging privacy inside Facebook.</p><p>Telegram markets itself as a secure, encrypted platform, although not every InfoSec expert agrees with that. Suffice it to say, it\u2019s clear Telegram\u2019s users like the fact they can sync their Telegram mobile messages with Telegram\u2019s desktop and tablet apps.

The pics show a device that remains very similar to previous generations, with a strongly dimpled plastic back, larger display and built-in fingerprint scanner.</p><p>The S5\u2019s dimensions put it squarely between the Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy S4, allowing for the larger 5-inch diagonal display that has been rumored already. The original Galaxy Note, you may recall, had a 5.3-inch diagonal display, which means the main flagship is approaching the original phablet\u2019s dimensions slowly but surely.</p><p>In the pics, we also get a peek at some of the new software features of the Galaxy S5, including a \u201cDownload Booster\u201d which apparently uses both LTE and Wi-Fi to speed up sizeable downloads of over 30MB, as well as the fingerprint scanning app itself. The device also apparently has IP67 water and dust-proofing, which should make it a very rugged device indeed, and that it carries a 16-megapixel camera on the back. Expect that camera to have some other special powers, as there appears to be potentially a small secondary lens or some other kind of sensor living next to the flash now.</p><p>The design looks overall pretty similar to its predecessor, and there\u2019s still plastic being used on the rear panel. It has a dimpled look this time around, however, and comes in at least white or black, but it\u2019s a little disappointing to see Samsung stick with essentially the same old formula for its flagship. Still, with high levels of water and dust resistance, this could prove to be one of the more durable smartphones out there (the plastic may not feel super premium, but it withstands drops pretty well).</p><p>We\u2019ve also heard (via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://9to5google.com/2014/02/24/exclusive-samsung-to-start-preloading-apps-onto-galaxy-devices-based-on-the-profession-and-interests-of-the-buyer/\">9to5Google</a>) that Samsung will offer up custom app deployments on the Galaxy S5 based on a shopper\u2019s job and interests, so that could affect homescreen appearance and other UI factors on these new flagships.

The case packs a huge 3,000 mAh battery within its glossy shell, which is slightly larger than the 2,850 mAh unit within the Galaxy S5 itself. True, you could carry around a spare battery for the GS5 and pop the back whenever you want more power, but the Mophie\u2019s extra juice is just a switch away, and it includes passthrough charging, which is a lot simpler than changing out internal components.</p><p>The Mophie comes in a variety of colors, but the review unit I was sent is a glossy white. It\u2019s like the Mophie battery packs you\u2019ve come to know and love, with a curved back ensconcing the \u2018baby bump\u2019 of the spare powerhouse. Of note, however, is that this will significantly increase the pocket presence of your GS5, since at its thickest point it more than doubles the depth of the device.</p><p>It also adds length to the top and bottom of the 4.7-inch smartphone, giving it a physical footprint more akin to that of the new iPhone 6 Plus, but with a much chunkier profile. As you might expect, it also adds weight. But the trade-offs have immediately apparent value: You\u2019ll likely get a full charge from empty from the battery pack, plus or minus a little bit depending. Given Samsung\u2019s already impressive battery life on the GS5, you\u2019ll find that can mean up to three or more full days of battery on a single charge of both the case and phone, which is game-changing when you\u2019re using it on excursions.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1063421\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/samsung-gs5-mophie-case2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=682\" alt=\"samsung-gs5-mophie-case2\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\"></p><p>I\u2019m reluctant to carry around the behemoth that the GS5 plus the Mophie becomes when combined Voltron-style too often, but for special cases like conferences it would be a veritable life-saver. Mophie\u2019s typical commitment to quality shows here, too, with a battery that should last you more cycles than lower cost options from Amazon.</p><p>Mophie\u2019s accessory will run you $99.95, so it\u2019s worth considering whether you need this kind of gear in your life before laying down some cash, but if you find yourself seeing that red battery icon more often than you\u2019d like, it\u2019s still likely your best, most convenient choice for spare top-ups.</p>", "title": ["Mophie\u2019s Samsung Galaxy S5 Juice Pack Gives You Ample Smartphone Life"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},
{"date": ["2012-02-23"], "text": "<p>If you\u2019re an iPhone user, you may not be as familiar with <a href=\"http://astrid.com/\">Astrid</a>, which has turned into one of the most popular \u201cto-do,\u201d list-making apps for Android. We first wrote about Astrid <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/29/angelpad-round-two/\">when it joined thirteen other startups that composed AngelPad\u2019s second batch</a>. Astrid\u2019s value proposition was simple: Offer users a clean, easy-to-use interface to enable sharing and collaboration around tasks. Other services have now come along to make this a familiar service, but the goal was for groups (businesses) to be able to assign tasks to each other, and broadcast to the group when those tasks are completed.</p><p>In the big picture, Astrid was conceived to be a social way to encourage friends and colleagues to help tackle your to-do list, from sending memos to buying your mom a Mother\u2019s Day present. A year removed from AngelPad, Astrid has moved across platforms, as the startup now offers a mobile site, Android, and iOS apps, with a Windows Phone app on the way. But, what some may not know is that Astrid was started as a side-project by co-founder Tim Su, then a software engineer at <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/palantir-technologies\">Palantir Technologies</a>. Su was joined by co-founder <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/jon-paris\">Jon Paris</a>, and the two launched Astrid on the Android Market when it was still young, back in the fall of 2008.</p><p>Collectively, the team were early adopters and proponents of Android, says Paris, but like so many others, they moved on to focus on building for iOS and other platforms. But, today, Astrid is officially returning to the platform on which it got its start, launching a new version of its service for Android tablets, accompanying a complete redesign for Android phones that features streamlined design and a new set of integrations aimed at helping users be more productive.</p><p>More specifically, Astrid\u2019s new app for Android tablets can be used independently, or synced with Android phones, iOS, and Astrid.com. The app is available now for the Samsung Galaxy Tab and Motorola Xoom, and will be made available in the next week for Kindle Fire through the Amazon App Store. The goal here, Paris says, is to make the UX easy for new users to adopt and learn without disrupting the experience of those using older versions.</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/screen-1-tasks.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-506934\" title=\"Screen 1 - Tasks.png\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/screen-1-tasks.png?w=188&amp;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"188\" height=\"300\"></a> And, to that point, the CEO tells us that Astrid has helped people complete over 30 million tasks and has racked up 3 million downloads across platforms. Yet, while Astrid is one of the most downloaded paid to-do apps in the Android Marketplace, the startup is today launching a new revenue stream via integration with <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/taskrabbit\">TaskRabbit</a>. Astrid has long offered users the ability to share tasks with family and friends, but, as part of its new look, users can now outsource individual to-dos to TaskRabbit, the fast-growing personal assistant that lets users list errands or tasks that needed to be completed in its marketplace. For those unfamiliar, it\u2019s basically an on-demand delivery network for outsourced tasks.</p><p>Astrid is also now offering users the ability to view suggestions/ideas through integrated search with Amazon and Google, for the simple reason that many of us start their tasks with a Google search before popping over to Amazon to make a purchase. Again, in case it\u2019s unclear, what Astrid is trying to do here is match to-dos and tasks with products and services that help get them done, a la TaskRabbit and Amazon. Paris says that he thinks this can be a win-win for both eCommerce retailers (and startups like TaskRabbit), as Astrid\u2019s users are inherently people with full plates, looking to manage their tasks and lighten the loads. And eCommerce sites now get the benefit of getting traffic from people that are more likely to buy.</p><p>In the case of TaskRabbit, for every user that ends up purchasing help on the site, for every transaction, Astrid takes a cut. Paris \u2014 and he\u2019s not alone \u2014 believes that the to-do list space is understandably a potential goldmine for purchase intent, something that has been supported by the interest around Pinterest and its related monetization path.</p><p>Clearly Gmail set the stage for crawling what is considered personal and sensitive information (your inbox) and matching it to related ads. Astrid is basically doing the same, serving up related ads when you search within the app for products/services that help you check off your tasks, but the CEO says that he understands the personal nature of to-dos, so users can turn off this new feature. Although not totally analogous, given what happened to Path, transparency in these situations is definitely advisable.</p><p>As to what\u2019s next, Paris mentioned that they are working with TaskRabbit to provide additional features around outsourcing your task list. A lot of people don\u2019t know which of their tasks to outsource to other people, so the team is expecting to offer the ability for its users to post their task lists on TaskRabbit and let other users flag all the items that they can help with. Beyond that, the startup is also considering adding a premium version of the service, and is embarking on its mission to raise its Series A. (It raised a seed round back in July of last year from Google Ventures, Nexus Venture Partners, and a few angel investors.)</p><p>As the collaborative economy heats up, and startups like TaskRabbit gain traction, it behooves services like Astrid to take group collaboration and task assigning outside its own walls, to the marketplaces that specialize in that kind of commerce. That can potentially be a lucrative relationship for both parties, though that remains to be seen. Along with a refreshed look for Android, adding subtasks to its service is another bonus. And, hey, now the 10 people that have Android tabs get to use Astrid 4.0, too. (Just kidding.)</p><p>For more on Astrid, <a href=\"http://astrid.com/\">check it out at home here</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/screen-5-tablet.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-506932\" title=\"Screen 5 - Tablet\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/screen-5-tablet.png?w=640&amp;h=450\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"450\"></a></p>", "title": ["Along With New Look, Apps, Astrid Now Lets You Outsource Tasks To TaskRabbit"], "author": ["Rip Empson"]},

We\u2019ve finally reached a point where most developed markets are experiencing single-digit growth while emerging markets are still growing at more than 30 percent collectively,\u201d said Ryan Reith, program director with IDC\u2019s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.</p><p>While Samsung remained the world\u2019s leading smartphone makers, IDC said it was the only company in the top five to see shipment volume decline year-over-year, thanks to competition as well as \u201ccooling demand for its high-end devices.\u201d Its main volume drivers for the quarter were mid-range and low-end devices, which means its average sales price also fell.</p><p>The launch of the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 Plus, meanwhile, pushed Apple to its largest third-quarter volume ever. While its brand new models sold 10 million units during their first launch weekend, there continued to be high demand for the iPhone 5s and 5c, which made up the bulk of Apple\u2019s volume for the quarter.</p><p>Lenovo\u2019s sales volumes were helped by the success of models like the A369i and A316, which cost less than $100 and are targeted at emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as the Middle East and Africa. Its non-China shipments reached 20 percent in Q3 2014, up 9 percent from a year ago.

Crucially, mobile ads are finally breaking through into meaningful shares of overall digital spend, and will account for nearly one-quarter of it this year.</p><p>When it comes to who is leading the mobile ad charge, Google very much remains at the top with eMarketer projecting that it will represent 46.8% of all revenues this year, although its position is diminishing, with Facebook picking up steam to account for 22% of mobile ad sales in 2014. No surprise, considering that last quarter was the first that Facebook, with its 945 million monthly active users on mobile, made <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/facebook-is-a-mobile-ad-company/\">more from mobile than desktop ads</a> \u2014 53% of total ad revenues to be specific. In 2012, it was only 12%. \u201cThe rapid pace in which mobile has taken over the company\u2019s ad revenue share indicates Facebook\u2019s mobile future,\u201d eMarketer writes.</p><p>Not unlike the division of riches in the smartphone world, after the two biggies, the shares drop dramatically. Twitter, eMarketer predicts, will take 2.6% of all mobile ad revenues in 2014, followed by Pandora at 1.7% \u2014 impressive for the music streaming company, considering that it has made little move to expand significantly outside of the U.S.</p><p>Significantly, iAd and Apple do not appear big enough to have been broken out in the rankings. Apple recently made an interesting acquisition of Burstly, which offers an app testing product called TestFlight but also an ad mediation product and related services under the Skyrocket brand. It will be interesting to see whether Apple decides to use this technology to expand its iAd platform. So far, Burstly has <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/13/burstly-apple-skyrocket/\">issued existing customers of Skyrocket</a> publishing termination notices, but with no detail about what that will mean in terms of the product and its future.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/EOhaossDsKn5mKqDwCksO5uloDJUUtTrWRFmiOS1bwjgXPpf5CiROGpW-wuHbvAx916BNTdOQGj6cGjtQVadE6egXeCQLFNcYjLmtS05vbzYevOPPyjhXao=s0-d-e1-ft#http://www.emarketer.com/images/chart_gifs/170001-171000/170637.gif\"></p><p>One interesting trend to note for the longer term is that while we are still seeing healthy growth in mobile ads, it\u2019s also slowing down. 2018, eMarketer believes, will see revenues of nearly $95 billion from mobile ads, but the growth of 105% that we saw in 2013 will be long gone: the market in 2018 will only see expansion of 22%:</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/c-K8z99LJGuO8aahjp1ewikXZ3I4ZyQV33bzCwjqqC4mnhrmlbfyFCsq5AeEAYvWQJSZrEP5pIUfz4rPcl6gbaZfQ16xzt3G0K4B4k1moOErlVVQnJuAa9o=s0-d-e1-ft#http://www.emarketer.com/images/chart_gifs/170001-171000/170793.gif\"></p><p>Why the decline of mobile ad growth? Two reasons, most likely. The first is the inevitable slow-down that comes as the medium matures. The second is a bit more interesting: the rise of other revenue models.</p><p>Specifically, consider companies like Supercell and King.com, mobile gaming giants that are throwing off huge amounts of cash ($5 million/day on average for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/supercell-revenue-and-profit-soars/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\">Supercell in 2013</a>) on free games that are built around in-app purchases of extra features, not advertising.</p><p>That speaks to a clear appetite for paid content that not just gaming apps but others will likely try to leverage in the years ahead, in contrast to recent years where free, ad-supported apps felt like nearly the only game in town.</p><p>Image:\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shannonkringen/2556016395/sizes/l/\">Flickr</a></p>", "title": ["Global Mobile Ad Spend Jumped 105% In 2013, On Track For $31.5B In 2014 Led By Google, Says eMarketer"], "author": ["Ingrid Lunden"]},

Among the first such devices will be the LG G Watch, a device which will launch next quarter based on the new platform. It showcases key features of the Android UI extension, including always-on voice commands that respond to the now-familiar \u201cOk Google.\u201d Other partners will debut hardware later this year, Google says.</p><p>Android Wear is starting with smartwatches, but is also meant to eventually extend to other wearables, according to Google. It\u2019s designed to be an extension of Google Now in many ways, with timely updates and suggestions provided to you as you need them most. It\u2019ll also answer spoken questions directly, thanks to the above-mentioned always-on listening for requests prompted by the \u201cOk Google\u201d command. Things you can ask for include requests about flight times, making reservations, sending texts and more.</p><p>In addition to notices and timely contextual information, Google is also focusing on health and fitness, with apps that provide goals, reminders and progress tracking for fitness routines, as well as real-time feedback. The smartwatch platform Google has created also centers on multi-screen control, making it so that you can issue commands to your wrist to control apps on connected devices. Google also mentions \u201ccast\u201d ability, so expect this to play nice with its Chromecast streamer hardware.</p><p>LG is a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/18/lg-g-watch-android-wear/\">key launch partner for Android Wear</a>, which is in keeping with what we\u2019d heard about the company\u2019s smartwatch plans previously. The smartphone maker has built the G Watch, which is expected to launch next quarter, and which LG is hoping will help it leapfrog others in this market (read: Samsung) by providing a low barrier to entry for developers, who don\u2019t have to learn a new language or build from scratch to design software for Android Wear, unlike for Tizen.</p><p>Motorola is also a key launch partner, with a summer launch for <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/18/motorola-introduces-the-moto-360-its-first-smartwatch-based-on-googles-android-wear/\">its Moto 360</a>, which already begins to show how different OEMs will have different takes on what to do with Android Wear.</p><p>Google is making a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2014/03/android-wear-developer-preview-now.html\">preview SDK available now for Android developers</a>, which is designed to make it easy to build extensions to existing smartphone Android apps that work with Android Wear, rather than for building standalone apps. Other early hardware partners include Asus, HTC, Motorola, Samsung, Fossil and more.</p><p>The preview SDK includes an emulator to show you devs how their notifications will look on an Android Wear device, with either square or round screens, and includes APIs that allow you to customize notifications to receive voice replies, showcase additional page content and stack with other, like notifications (meaning you can perhaps browse Wear notifications by type, i.e. all text-based messages stacked).</p><p>This is a natural direction for Google to go in with Android, and the execution as it stands currently looks very heavy on the Google Now features, but with a focus on extending rather than replacing the smartphone experience. That\u2019s the approach taken by Pebble, too, with its heavily notification-based smartwatch platform, and quite different from earlier attempts like the Sony Smartwatch and Smartwatch 2, which haven\u2019t managed to really nail real-time information and updates, and other approaches that have targeted watch-specific standalone software (the first Galaxy Gear was somewhat guilty of this).</p><p>At this stage, we\u2019re still looking mostly at Google stretching its legs with wearables and trying to teach partners what they can do with this kind of device. Accordingly, I\u2019d look to this first generation of Android Wear hardware as a group of devices trying to find its feet, with more refined gadgets to follow down the road.</p><p>\u00a0</p>", "title": ["Google\u2019s Android Wear, A Platform For Smartwatches, Debuts With The LG \u2018G\u2019 And Moto 360"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},

This only works with Google Chrome, though, because other browsers don\u2019t feature built-in U2F support yet.</p><p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1218123\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/edge-in-use-3-blue-third1-444x224.png?w=400&amp;h=202\" alt=\"Edge-In-Use-3-blue-third1-444x224\" width=\"400\" height=\"202\">GitHub already supported two-factor authentication through apps like Authenticator and over SMS. The company\u2019s VP of security\u00a0Shawn Davenport told me that about 300,000 of GitHub\u2019s 11 million users currently use two-factor authentication. To increase this number \u2014 and jumpstart the adoption of security keys on GitHub \u2014 the company has partnered with Yubico, and it\u2019s allowing the first 5,000 buyers to\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yubi.co/github\">purchase\u00a0keys for $5</a>\u00a0and is offering a 20 percent discount for those who miss the cutoff.</p><p>Davenport also told me that the company started to run into a number of issues with supporting two-factor authentication lately. Sending SMS internationally, for example, is still somewhat unreliable.\u00a0Users also often upgrade their phones and then forget to transfer their security tokens between phones, so the authenticator apps don\u2019t work.</p><p>Yubico CEO and founder Stina Ehrensvard noted that GitHub is now her company\u2019s third major partner for getting U2F keys into the market. The first were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.yubico.com/2014/10/google-releases-support-fido-u2f-security-key/\">Google</a> and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/12/dropbox-adds-support-for-u2f-security-keys/\">Dropbox</a>. \u00a0As she told me, the company is seeing \u201cgood momentum\u201d from these partnerships. She argues that what\u2019s missing right now for even wider adoption, though, is support from other browser vendors. Yubico is talking to Mozilla and Microsoft, but \u201cthey are not moving very fast,\u201d Ehrensvard told me.</p>", "title": ["GitHub Launches Support For U2F Security Keys"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},

And Facebook\u2019s head of measurement and insights\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/01/net-us-facebook-ads-idUSBRE8900I120121001\">Brad Smallwood is at the IAB MIXX conference toda</a>y, where he gave a talk about the partnership.</p><p>The goal of the partnership is to track whether Facebook ad campaigns are driving in-store sales and to find the common themes among the campaigns that work. Facebook and Datalogix have tracked about 50 ad campaigns from which they have already drawn three general lessons.</p><p>First, Smallwood said that ad impressions, rather than clicks, drive sales. In fact, in the DataLogix campaigns, 99 percent of sales were from people who saw ads but didn\u2019t interact with them. To back that up, he also also pointed to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/consumer/research-shows-link-between-online-brand-metrics-and-offline-sales/\">a Nielsen study</a> showing that there\u2019s virtually no correlation between clicks on ads and either brand metrics or offline sales. Smallwood added that focusing on clicks makes sense in some cases, such as direct-response campaigns, but those clicks don\u2019t tell you anything about \u201cthe otucomes that happen in the grocery store, in the car dealership, or in the local coffee shop.\u201d</p><p>Second, he said that reach (rather than just targeting a narrow audience) is an important part of these campaigns, just as it is in television. Brands that maximized the reach of their campaigns saw a 70 percent improvement in the return on investment.</p><p>Finally, he said brands need to optimize the frequency of their ad campaigns, specifically by reallocating impressions from people who see an ad frequently to those who don\u2019t. Seems like an obvious point, but Smallwood said brands who made that kind of shift saw a 40 percent increase in ROI. He also said the \u201cfrequency sweet spot\u201d will differ from brand to brand, and from campaign to campaign \u2014 if you\u2019re an established consumer packaged goods (CPG) company, people probably don\u2019t need to see your ad as often as they would if you were launching a brand-new tech device and needed to get consumers familiar with the details.</p><p>Now, 50 campaigns may seem like a pretty small sample size, particularly since they weren\u2019t randomly chosen. But after his talk, Smallwood pointed out that the companies were selected by Facebook\u2019s \u201cclient council,\u201d so the social network couldn\u2019t just choose the advertisers that would see the most impressive results. Even though the initial campaigns came from CPG brands, Smallwood said there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t expand the studies to include other types of advertisers.</p><p>So far, the partnership seems to have attracted attention (at least from the press) primarily for its privacy implications. When I brought up the privacy concerns with Smallwood, he said that neither Facebook nor Datalogix should gain any additional information about individual users \u2014 instead, both companies use\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function\">hashed</a>\u00a0data to create an aggregate picture of how many people who saw a given ad campaign actually bought related products.</p><p>By the way, if you want a more impartial analysis, here\u2019s how <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/09/deep-dive-facebook-and-datalogix-whats-actually-getting-shared-and-how-you-can-opt\">the Electronic Frontier Foundation laid out the process</a>:</p><p>I asked if Facebook is feeling more pressure to monetize its user data now that it\u2019s a publicly traded company, and Smallwood responded that Facebook has been \u201cbuilding these systems right from the start\u201d (presumably, he wasn\u2019t referring to the Datalogix partnership, but the general suite of ads and analytics products).</p><p>It\u2019s also worth noting that Datalogix is already tracking this kind of purchase behavior for non-Facebook ad campaigns, so it may seem a little unfair (though unsurprising) that the Facebook partnership is drawing so much scrutiny. Is Facebook being forced to clear a higher bar on privacy than other companies?</p><p>\u201cI certainly feel like there\u2019s a lot of scrutiny on privacy,\u201d Smallwod said. \u201cAnd there is a higher bar, but it\u2019s an internal bar that we hold ourselves to.\u201d</p>", "title": ["Facebook\u2019s Brad Smallwood Offers More Data On Ad Effectiveness, Says Datalogix Partnership Isn\u2019t A Privacy Risk"], "author": ["Anthony Ha"]},

Make sure to watch the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhrbT9O6kW8\">video</a>, which is very Apple-esque in its elegance and emotion. When Facebook announces these kind of apps, it evokes memories of their previous attempts to build and distribute standalone apps that unbundle one of its features, such as Camera, Poke, or Messenger. The initial reaction within the technology startup community has been a mix of skepticism and excitement, with some drooling over the new design (it does look good) while others lament its a copy (some interactions do look like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flipboard.com\">Flipboard</a>).</p><p>This all begs a question: Will Paper go the way of Poke, or the way of Messenger? The answer will have big consequences for Facebook.</p><p>On mobile devices, Messenger has been successfully unbundled from Facebook. Messenger is one of the top messaging apps out there, it works great, and even today, Facebook is so focused on making sure everyone has it on their phones that they actually route users who are inside Facebook\u2019s main app entirely out to Messenger (and then back in) to coax the behavior of using Messenger itself. With Poke, as we all can recall, even Facebook wasn\u2019t able to use its enormous, engaged mobile user base to turn it into a real experience to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.semilshah.com/2013/12/30/how-snapchat-became-the-breakout-consumer-product-of-2013/\">rival</a> Snapchat. This episode was a highly visible example of how Facebook\u2019s high mobile engagement could shoot any app right to the top of the charts, but also exposed the limits of its power to affect mobile engagement as users quickly abandoned the product experience.</p><p>When it comes to Facebook and mobile, we are witnessing the early stages of the company\u2019s attempt to unbundle and distribute its core features in new mobile products. Back in September 2011, I wrote a column right <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/18/the-facebook-iphone/\">here</a> on TechCrunch which argued Facebook\u2019s strategy for blanketing our devices with their software was to break it up. You can read that post <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/18/the-facebook-iphone/\">here</a>, and make sure to check out the picture. Two and a half years later, Facebook is in a much stronger mobile position. Earlier this week for earnings, Facebook shared mobile stats, reporting nearly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gordonbowman.com/post/75063536203/in-charts-facebooks-rise-in-mobile\">950m MAUs and 550m DAU\u2019s</a>. This type of scale and engagement for mobile apps affords Facebook incredible amounts of actionable data, which translates to market power, which they use to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.semilshah.com/2013/08/13/some-thoughts-on-facebooks-ads-stock-price-and-instagram/\">line their pockets</a> through mobile app install ads \u2014 just wait until they roll out mobile re-engagement ads and deep-linking options, as well.</p><p>Can Facebook, moving forward, effectively leverage the power and scale of its own network to drive its daily active users to new mobile experiences (as they\u2019re doing with Messenger), or will users only temporarily flock to only to abandon them (as they did with Poke)? And, in the case of Paper specifically, will users convert to getting real-time mobile push notifications about news and stories about their friends, or will they find this spammy and revert back to their original sources of news (which includes regular Facebook)?</p><p>It will be interesting to see the world\u2019s reaction tomorrow (February 3) when Paper is released. Two great pieces on this are by TechCrunch\u2019s own <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com/joshconstine\">Josh Constine</a>, who takes a deep dive on<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/one-app-at-a-time/\"> Facebook\u2019s Plot To Conquer Mobile: Shatter Itself Into Pieces</a>, and Wanelo\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com/besvinick\">Adam Besvinick</a>, who looks <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/philosophy-logic/2a695e4529ee\">beyond the motive to unbundle</a> when it comes to Paper. Facebook is a very different mobile company today than it was a year ago, or two years ago. The scale is just massive, and the engagement is off the charts. Assuming the product experience itself is relevant, which is why news and personal stories are interesting, even a low conversion rate to Paper would be a very sizeable audience. The reason we see more and more news apps on our phones or in the App Store is because checking the news isn\u2019t just a daily active use case, it\u2019s a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.semilshah.com/2013/08/26/a-story-about-threading-the-needle-on-mobile/\">multiple-times-a-day hyperactive use case</a>, and one that Facebook, with their mobile user data, their algorithms, and their scale and engagement, could exploit with this move and be the first thing people read in the morning \u2014 just like the newspaper used to be. Only time will tell, so pick up the Paper tomorrow morning and read all about it.</p><p><strong>Photo Credit:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ihateyou/2905684780/sizes/m/\">Je suis Samuel</a> / <em>Creative Commons Flickr</em></p>", "title": ["Unpacking Facebook\u2019s Mobile Strategy: Paper, All The Mobile News That\u2019s Fit To Print"], "author": ["Semil Shah"]},

It doesn\u2019t\u00a0raise funds with an eye to how attractive to the markets are. It is investing regardless of the external economic forces because that\u2019s what it\u00a0does, he explained.</p><p>BVP won\u2019t\u00a0name their investors, but he says it\u2019s the usual institutional suspects.</p><p>The firm concentrates on seed rounds and series A and B. Among their hits at\u00a0that level are Twilio, Pinterest, Yelp, Skype and Shopify. BVP\u00a0will still come in later when it feels it might have missed something early on and believes there\u2019s still value, as when it invested later in growth rounds for LinkedIn and Box.</p><p>BVP is coming off a banner year with 35 new investments and 21 exits of previous ones including the IPOs of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://2u.com/\">2U</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ceruleanrx.com/\">Cerulean Pharma</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.proteontherapeutics.com/\">Proteon Therapeutics</a>.

The firm\u00a0currently has\u00a0a ratio of approximately two-thirds US investment to one-third outside the US, and it\u00a0wants to increase worldwide investment where it\u00a0has had some success.</p><p>It\u00a0currently has\u00a0offices in Israel, and the India (in addition to US offices in Menlo Park, Cambridge and \u00a0New York ) and the company has had some big hits\u00a0outside the US including French ad-tech company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.criteo.com/\">Criteo</a>, which Deeter calls \u201cthe biggest exit ever over there.\u201d BVP has\u00a0also invested in 15-20 companies in London and partners travel there frequently.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had an office in Silicon Valley for 30-something years, and our investments our [somewhat] Silicon Valley-centric, but we\u2019ve always had a world view,\u201d Levine explained.</p><p>Just last week, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/10/israeli-intelligence-vets-get-18m-investment-for-new-approach-to-cybersecurity/\">we wrote about Team8, an Israeli security company</a>, which BVP invested in. Team8 is run by a pair of former Unit 8200 officers, who have a unique approach to cybersecurity. David Cowan, a BVP partner with over 20 years experience investing in security companies took the lead on that.</p><p>As for investments over\u00a0the next 4 year cycle, BVP is looking at a number of areas including many you would expect such as the aforementioned cybersecurity along with mobile, consumer internet and cloud and SaaS.</p><p>As you would expect, it is\u00a0looking for companies that take an unusual approach or solve a problem that hasn\u2019t been digitized yet.

It\u2019s part of Facebook\u2019s ongoing quest to show businesses that ads on the social network are not just scattershot brand marketing jazz, but can actually reach the exact customers that buy their products.</p><p>That\u2019s been a bit of a struggle, as a combination of complicated products, targeting restrictions, and advertiser inexperience has led some businesses to fail to produce results. These businesses sometimes go out of their way to blast Facebook\u2019s ad platform as ineffective, scaring away other big advertisers.</p><p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-766934\" alt=\"help\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/help.png?w=300&amp;h=245\" width=\"300\" height=\"245\">This is partly why Facebook launched the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/20/facebook-crm-ads/\">Custom Audiences program</a> in September. It\u2019s an important complement to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/13/facebook-exchange/\">Facebook Exchange</a>, which allows for real-time, cookie-based retargeting of people who visit an advertiser\u2019s website. Data providers can use cookies to add people to Custom Audiences, but can also use email sign-ups and other contact information.</p><p>The four new partners already work with many of the world\u2019s biggest brands to target email marketing, direct mail, and other online ads. Now they\u2019ll be able to use the same ones <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook-studio.com/news/item/new-ways-to-reach-the-right-audience\">to pinpoint Facebook ads</a>, as Facebook explains on its Studio Blog. Businesses can request their data partner upload a privacy-protected, hashed list of customer or potential customer information such as email addresses. The advertiser can then target these sets of people, but don\u2019t ever know the identity of who they\u2019re reaching.</p><p>Businesses who don\u2019t already work with one of these data providers can still take advantage of the partnership. Facebook is setting up pre-defined categories like auto-intenders (people planning to buy cars), luxury fashion-buyers, and more that any business can target.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-766933\" alt=\"Facebook Data Provider Ad Custom Audiences\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/facebook-data-provider-ad-custom-audiences1.gif?w=535&amp;h=217\" width=\"535\" height=\"217\"></p><p>Anecdotal tests of the program provided by Facebook show promise, with Chicago car dealership Castle Auto Group seeing a 24X return on their ad spend through a combination of Facebook offers targeted to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/ads-api/custom-audience-targeting/\">Custom Audiences</a> of their existing\u00a0customers. Hong Kong game developer Klingnet reduced their cost per install by 40 percent by using Custom Audiences of people likely to enjoy their titles.</p><p>Along with data protections and hashing to keep advertisers from determining the names or identities of people located by the third-party data providers, Facebook is offering users opt-outs from the program. Facebook went so far as to publish a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-and-privacy/ad-targeting-and-your-privacy-keeping-you-informed-on-ad-targeting-updates/517330291650191\">Note on its Privacy Page</a> detailing how people can click on Custom Audiences ads to see what specific advertiser was targeting them, hide future ads from that advertiser, and be exempt from that data provider\u2019s targeting.</p><p>If the Custom Audiences program works, a Honda dealership could go from targeting \u201cpeople who like Honda in Chicago\u201d to \u201cpeople in Chicago shown to have visited car-buying websites, signed up for dealership email, or bought a Honda between three and ten years ago.\u201d As you can imagine, the latter is a lot more likely to lead to a sale. If businesses make money with Facebook ads, they\u2019ll spend money on Facebook ads.</p><p>This is all part of a grander shift of online ads getting more accurate. With time, more offline and online purchases and behavior are going to be tied to demographic clusters and individuals. Out will go the vaguely targeted shotgun approach ads of TV and print. In will come laser-pinpointed ads that reach people genuinely ready to spend money on a product. This bodes very well for online ad platforms where people spend a lot of time including Twitter and media sites, but most of all Facebook. If you have a captive, always-there audience, you\u2019re going to make a fortune once measurement and targeting tech evolve.</p>", "title": ["Facebook Lets Advertisers Tap Purchase Data Partners To Target Customers, Categories Like Car-Buyers"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},

There are definitely exceptions to this trend (see: the fantastic <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://store.unity3d.com/\">Unity3D</a>, which has a free product but charges by developer seat for Pro features, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/\">Irrlicht</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ogre3d.org/\">Ogre3D</a>, both of which are free and open-source), but most of the big-name engines (Source, Unreal, CryENGINE) have stuck to this licensing model for years.</p><p>So why would Havok just give away its new mobile engine? Out of the kindness of their hearts? Perhaps. But remember: Intel bought Havok in 2007. Intel is making a <em>hard</em> push into mobile. People love mobile games. If Intel can make sure Intel-powered phones run a few hugely popular games better than anyone else\u2019s phones, it works out to more OEMs stuffing Intel chips in their handsets moving forward.</p><p>Interested developers can sign up for news on the project <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.projectanarchy.com/\">here</a>, with initial availability expected sometime this Spring.</p>", "title": ["Havok Announces Project Anarchy, A Totally Free Engine For 3D Mobile Games"], "author": ["Greg Kumparak"]},

In a way, it kind of came out of left field. Since it\u2019s a Google Ventures company, one can guess that those on Google\u2019s campus were very familiar with the service, which provides an easy alternative to waiting around for packages at your house.</p><p>Not only is package delivery a bummer, because things get lost, hitting up your mailbox when you get home isn\u2019t that much fun either. The worst is when you don\u2019t even have a mailbox and you come home to twenty pieces of junkmail slipped under your door. The mail delivery system is broken and old. It\u2019s ripe for\u2026disruption. How broken? The US Post Office <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cir.ca/s/zJE\">lost $15.9B in 2012</a>.</p><p>So at first blush, one could say that Google wants to compete with the likes of shipping magicians like Amazon and UPS, but I think that it goes a bit deeper than that.

Maybe <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/how-googles-powerful-lobby-legalized-driverless-cars-in-california/\">one day it\u2019ll drive itself</a> thanks to Google.</p><p>Back to BufferBox, the YCombinator company that currently only operates in Canada.

These things can be dropped off in a box in a place that\u2019s more convenient for you, say by your office. That way, you can pick it up when you want to, and come home to a nice relaxing home, and clean doorstep. Let\u2019s not forget to mention the anxiety of worrying about a package being stolen by a neighbor. It happens.</p><p>So in a nutshell, one must only <em>wonder</em> why Google picked up BufferBox, because Google never really goes into great detail on why it acquires companies. It doesn\u2019t really have to, for competitive reasons. Just know that everything at Google tends to happen as part of a master plan, and this particular acquisition could lead to a <em>massive</em> master plan.</p><p>Remember when <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2007/06/24/google-to-acquire-grand-central-for-50-million/\">Google bought GrandCentral</a>? It turned into Google Voice. The service that could one day compete with the likes of AT&amp;T and Verizon. That acquisition was led by Google\u2019s Wesley Chan, now a partner at Google Ventures. He thinks big, so does Google. Just when you thought the GrandCentral acquisition was going nowhere, Google Voice was launched.</p><p>Searching all of the world\u2019s information, free or cheaper Internet for all, free phone numbers and voicemail, devices like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/18/chromebook-samsung-249/\">laptops that are priced fairly</a> for Education and lower-income families running powerhouse open-source software, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/03/08/for-the-last-time-lets-all-say-it-together-google-is-not-a-social-network/\">services that make everything we do online feel more intimate</a> and social, both <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/29/google-enters-the-social-enterprise-with-public-debut-of-google-for-businesses-free-through-2013/\">at work</a> and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/01/the-best-part-about-google-hangouts-is-that-the-technology-itself-completely-disappears/\">home</a>, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/youtube-iphone-app-ads-exclamation-point/\">reinventing television</a>\u2026there is an obvious pattern.

Like a <del datetime=\"2013-03-15T16:26:41+00:00\">blogger</del> normal person, you go to work and hope that the package is there when you get home. That hope slowly turns into worry as you picture your valuable freight sitting outside of your home, while people walk by it and wonder what it is.</p><p>There are a few companies providing solutions for this problem, setting up physical locations for you to have your packages shipped to, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/30/amazon-lockers-silicon-valley/\">such as commerce juggernaut Amazon</a>. A few months ago, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/30/why-did-google-buy-bufferbox-because-the-entire-mail-and-package-delivery-system-is-broken/\">Google picked up a Canada-based company called Bufferbox</a>, a YC-alum, which left the space wide open for a startup to jump in and fill the void. That startup also comes from Y Combinator, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.swapbox.com\">Swapbox</a>, and the team is launching physical kiosks in the San Francisco area during its beta period.</p><p>Currently, there are two Swapbox locations, one at Stanford, where the co-founders Nitin Shantharam and Neel Murthy attended school, and the other in Glen Park. Currently, you can have your first package delivered to a Swapbox for free, and pay $1.99 for each one after, which is next to nothing.</p><p>I sat down with the team and discussed their plans, which are pretty lofty and impressive.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/22bc6b5.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-778343\" alt=\"22bc6b5\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/22bc6b5.jpg?w=200\" width=\"200\"></a><b>TC:</b> Tell us about your team.</p><p><b>Neel Murthy:</b> Team is two people \u2013 Neel Murthy and Nitin Shantharam.

We also have a great group of advisers and of course a ton of support from YC.</p><p><b>TC:</b> How many Swapbox locations do you hope to have open in the next six months?</p><p><b>Neel Murthy:</b> Our goal is to have at least 15 locations in the next six months. The mission is to bring a Swapbox close to as many people in San Francisco as fast as possible. In addition, we don\u2019t want to put these in locations where people don\u2019t need Swapboxes, so consumer demand will dictate how many/where Swapboxes are in SF.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/swapbox_stanford.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-778345\" alt=\"swapbox_stanford\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/swapbox_stanford.png?w=300&amp;h=199\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\"></a><b>TC:</b> What is the biggest hurdle to working in the real world vs. virtual?</p><p><b>Neel Murthy:</b> The biggest hurdle with the real world is that we have physical devices that take up space and weigh something, which obviously presents logistical challenges that traditional companies don\u2019t see. However, what we really want to do is merge the real world with the virtual world in an entirely virtuous fashion. When you are dealing with the virtual world there are less physical regulations and restrictions. In addition, traditional tech companies tend to have an audience that is more global than local, so we have different growth strategies that are more local and grassroots rather than viral.</p><p><b>TC:</b> Other than joining YC, how much money have you raised or bootstrapped with?</p><p><b>Neel Murthy:</b> Prior to YC, the entire company was bootstrapped through our own savings.<br>\n\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><p>The postal service and shipping companies like FedEx and UPS don\u2019t have the best reputation with consumers these days, and there is quite a bit of opportunity for the model that Swapbox is working on, including doing co-branded Swapbox\u2019s with online retailers like Fab, for instance. All you have to do is request a Swapbox address, and the shipping company will get a pin to drop your package off. It\u2019s completely safe, and you can go make your pickup at any time just by swiping your credit card at the kiosk.</p><p>One of the interesting things to note is that one of the designers that are working on the physical Swapbox is a former Apple employee, so you know that they\u2019re going to have an eye for making beautiful products. The team has been working on this product for well over a year, and Shantharam says that the two think quite a bit about what commerce is going to look like in 50 years from now or 100 years from now. The other advantage for Swapbox that fascinated the team was automating as much of this process as possible, as that\u2019s what they\u2019ve homed in on as the main pain point for consumers.</p><p>As far as manufacturing the kiosks themselves, the team has found a cost-efficient way to do it here in Silicon Valley, rather than outsource it to a location like China. This is something that they\u2019re very proud of.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.swapbox.com\">Swapbox</a> hopes that their service catches on and draws repeat customers, and if demand starts generating from specific places in the San Francisco area, that\u2019s where they\u2019ll put their next kiosk. For what Murthy proudly described as \u201can automated doorman,\u201d the pair did its research along the way. The first ever Swapbox at Stanford consisted of Murthy and Shantharam sitting at a table for 48 hours straight. Murthy joked \u201cWe were a phsyical Swapbox, and we learned quite a bit. Also, it wasn\u2019t very healthy of us to do.\u201d</p><p>Here\u2019s a look at a unit that you might see pop up in your neighborhood sometime soon, but the company is working on a new design they tell me:</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/swapbox_sf1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-778357\" alt=\"swapbox_SF1\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/swapbox_sf1.png?w=600&amp;h=399\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\"></a></p><p>Recently, Murthy had a pie shipped to his house and wasn\u2019t there to pick it up. After dealing with tracking the package, the pie had perished. This is something that has happened to me personally with perishable goods and it\u2019s quite frustrating.</p><p>Convenience and comfort are key when you\u2019re talking about shipping and receiving, and Swapbox cares about both of those things. By using technology to solve real-world problems, these guys could actually pick up where Bufferbox left off in Canada and show larger companies like Amazon how it\u2019s done the scrappy way.</p>", "title": ["Y Combinator Company Swapbox Launches And Aims To Pick Up Where Bufferbox Left Off"], "author": ["Drew Olanoff"]},

But Amazon\u2019s\u00a0service will have\u00a0a $299 annual fee, though <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2015/amazonfresh-delays-299year-prime-fresh-rollout-for-another-3-months/\">the deadline to subscribe has been pushed back repeatedly</a>\u00a0(which may indicate pricing could be a concern).\u00a0At the same time,\u00a0Amazon has muddied the waters by <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/16/amazons-prime-now-expands-to-l-a-ramps-up-for-socal-grocery-deliveries/\">expanding its\u00a0grocery delivery options though its one-hour delivery service Prime Now</a> \u2013 including in some of the same markets where AmazonFresh is live.</p><p>Walmart, on the other hand, has been testing both online grocery delivery and local pickup at a number of stores. It tried delivery in Denver and San Jose, but has seemed to favor local pickup as that service has been the one\u00a0to expand\u00a0over the course of 2015.</p><p>Prior to\u00a0today, local pickup was live in five markets, including San Jose, California; Bentonville, Arkansas; Phoenix, Arizona; Denver, Colorado; and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/12/walmart-expands-its-online-grocery-shopping-with-store-pickup-option-to-two-more-markets/\">more recently, Huntsville, Alabama</a>.</p><p>As of now, Walmart is announcing a slew of new markets are going live with online grocery shopping. These include: Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte and Fayetteville, N.C.; Salt Lake City and Ogden, Utah; Nashville, Tennessee; Tucson, Arizona; and Colorado Springs, Colorado. Customers in these regions can begin filling their\u00a0online carts today, but\u00a0pickup itself begins October 13.</p><p>In addition, the retailer says the plan is to roll out online grocery shopping to even more stores and regions in the weeks ahead, but is not sharing details.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1216253\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/walmart-online-grocery-pickup-placing-order-in-vehicle.jpg?w=680&amp;h=453\" alt=\"Walmart Online Grocery Pickup - placing order in vehicle\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\"></p><p>The choice of cities is somewhat interesting, too. (Ogden?!) While grocery delivery competitors often focus on denser, urban markets, Walmart is choosing good-sized cities, some with millions of households, but also those that are being passed over by grocery delivery providers. That speaks to there being something more of a \u201csecret sauce\u201d that Walmart is looking for in terms of its customer demographics.</p><p>On that front, it seems important to point out\u00a0that the new\u00a0service is seeing more women than men shopping for groceries online, as well as a mix of loyal Walmart shoppers combined with new customers.</p><p>\u201cThe majority of what we see coming and the focus of the Walmart customer base is largely women \u2013 that\u2019s what we have a lot of. We see a lot of women with kids in car seats, who are moving from place to place throughout the day,\u201d explains Michael Bender, EVP and COO, Walmart Global e-commerce.</p><p>The way <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://walmart.com/grocery\">the grocery shopping service</a> works involves\u00a0a combination of online and offline interactions between the customer and the retailer. Customers shop online via the Walmart website, adding items to their cart \u2013 which they can even save throughout the week as they build their order if they choose.</p><p>There are around 30,000 SKUs available, which is comparable to what you\u2019d find in the store. The majority are grocery items, though there is also a limited selection of general merchandise available, too. The prices are the same as they are in the store, and there\u2019s no fee for using the service. However, unlike when you shop in store, coupons are not accepted.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1216251\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/walmart-online-grocery-how_it_works_pov-large.jpg?w=680&amp;h=394\" alt=\"Walmart online grocery- How_It_Works_POV large\" width=\"680\" height=\"394\"></p><p>When the order is complete, the customer pays online, then sets their pickup time frame. When that time arrives,\u00a0they drive to their local Walmart store and park in a designated space reserved for online grocery shoppers located either in the front or side of the store. After parking, they call the store at a number provided both via their original confirmation email, and again through a reminder call a few minutes ahead of their pickup time.</p><p>A\u00a0store associate will then bring out a cart filled with their groceries, including the fresh and frozen items which had been picked and stored separately in coolers and freezers in the back of the store in advance of the customer\u2019s arrival.</p><p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1216257\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/walmart-online-grocery-pickup-designated-parking-signs.jpg?w=234&amp;h=352\" alt=\"Walmart Online Grocery Pickup - Designated Parking Signs\" width=\"234\" height=\"352\">Bender confirms that the retailer is increasing headcount by hiring full-time \u201cpersonal shoppers\u201d who handle picking the customers\u2019 orders. Over time, the technology\u00a0will become more personalized to each customer, he says, by allowing grocery shoppers to make specific requests \u2013 like asking for a particular ripeness to a fruit, for example.<br>\nThe exec also\u00a0notes that with each subsequent launch of online grocery shopping, customer adoption has accelerated faster than in the previous market, indicating growing consumer interest in this service.\u00a0However, the retailer declined to talk about adoption numbers, transaction volume or other specific metrics.</p><p>The strategy of focusing on pickups is not unique to Walmart, but something many brick-and-mortar retailers are considering in order to compete with the growing number of delivery services. For example, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/25/same-day-shopping-app-curbside-picks-up-25-million-more/\">Target and Best Buy are testing local pickup in partnership with Curbside</a>. Meanwhile, a number major U.S. retailers have offered in-store pickup and ship-to-store programs for years.</p><p>Given that it\u2019s\u00a0still early days for online grocery shopping here in the U.S., it\u2019s unclear which type of service \u2013 delivery or pickup \u2013 American consumers will gravitate toward in the months ahead. But Walmart\u2019s strategy has always been about offering\u00a0hybrid e-commerce experience where the digital and physical converge.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of the more visible manifestations of that goal we have as a company,\u201d says Bender. \u201cWe think we\u2019re positioned well to be a significant player in the [online grocery shopping space] going forward,\u201d he adds.</p>", "title": ["Walmart Doubles Down On Online Grocery Shopping With Curbside Pickup"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

The company is led by a founding team of three University of Waterloo\u00a0graduates, Mike McCauley, Aditya Bali and Jay Shah. The startup actually already shares a building with Google\u2019s Waterloo office, and is located in the Communitech accelerator VeloCity Garage offices in that city.</p><p>The terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed (<strong>update:</strong> we\u2019re hearing $17 million+, see below), but the purchase of the two year-old startup \u00a0is definitely an interesting one. BufferBox founder McCauley told the <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://business.financialpost.com/2012/11/30/google-snaps-up-waterloo-startup-bufferbox/\">Financial Post </a></em>in an interview that the company hopes to \u201cbuild out [its] vision a bit quicker\u201d thanks to the resources and talent newly available from Google. BufferBox will retain its distinct brand as part of the deal, according to Google speaking to the <em>Financial Post</em>, but the company didn\u2019t elaborate on its plans for the startup, beyond sharing the opinion that there are lots of opportunities related to \u201cend-to-end\u201d relationships with shoppers.</p><p>When contacted for comment, a Google spokesperson shared the following statement about the acquisition:</p><p>Google is apparently building a big chunk of the mobile commerce side of its business out of Waterloo, where\u2019s there\u2019s a steady stream of engineering talent from the nearby University of Waterloo, which supplies graduates to Apple, Facebook and a number of the other top Silicon Valley tech companies and startups.</p><p>BufferBox will already offer 100 of its delivery lockers in the GTA and Hamilton area in Canada by the end of next year, located primarily at transit depots, to allow users to sign up for one-time use delivery. Amazon currently offers a similar service, through its Lockers program, which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/30/amazon-lockers-silicon-valley/\">expanded to Silicon Valley this summer</a> and which likewise uses temporary codes to enable single-use delivery.

It may seem like an inconvenient alternative to home delivery at first \u2014 until you think about some of the headaches that can come up, like worrying one of your neighbors will swipe the package as it\u2019s sitting on your doorstep, or making sure you\u2019re at home to sign for it.

That, along with the limited locations, suggests this is still very much an experiment.

The timeframe for launch was described as \u201cearly 2015\u201d when the Apple Watch was originally announced in September of last year.</p><p>The Apple Watch release date has been the subject of much speculation since its announcement, with recent reports pegging March as the month of its arrival. Cook\u2019s decision to add some clarity to its actual release timeline is uncharacteristic for Apple, which normally doesn\u2019t put a firm launch date on unreleased products, but pre-announcing the hardware months in advance was already a departure from standard practice.</p><p>Setting a more definite timeline for the Apple Watch does set expectations, however, ensuring that no one will be surprised when the wearable doesn\u2019t appear in March as rumored. It also helps developers time their software releases correctly. Developers wanting to target the platform have so far depended upon using a virtual simulation of the wearable, and haven\u2019t had any set deadline to work towards, so an announced April shipping target provides a clear goal to aim for.</p><p>Apple\u2019s decision to pre-announce the Apple Watch was designed in part to get developers on board with the platform, so this helps set expectations in that regard. Its typical secrecy around product launches also isn\u2019t necessary in this case, given that the Watch was pre-announced last year and expectations were already set for a general window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m using it every day, and love it, and I can\u2019t live without it,\u201d Cook said on the call, explaining his own excitement for the product.

By 2009, there probably weren\u2019t a ton\u00a0of enterprise customers looking for custom mobile applications except for the most experimental of the bunch.</p><p>Yet, Apperian endured and developed into an enterprise app store company when customers began asking for an alternative to launching their custom\u00a0apps in public app stores from Apple and Google.</p><p>While Apperian tends to compete with Mobile Device Management (MDM)\u00a0vendors like AirWatch (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/22/vmwares-1-5b-airwatch-buy-all-about-mobile-workplace/\">which was sold to VMware</a>) and Good Technology, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/04/blackberry-goes-shopping-again-buys-good-technology/#.v3ewwm:U9gq\">which was sold to BlackBerry just last week</a>, the company differentiates itself from these vendors by\u00a0allowing\u00a0customers to deploy outside of an MDM system, CEO Brian Day explained.</p><p>The company believes this gives them a leg up with customers\u00a0that want to deploy custom apps to partners, consultants and other non-employees\u00a0who\u00a0would likely be reluctant to let these companies have access to their phones.</p><p>While leading with an Asian investment company might seem out of the ordinary, Day said his company\u00a0went this route for a couple of reasons. First of all, it wanted favorable terms and valuation that wouldn\u2019t require board-level involvement. While the company wouldn\u2019t disclose its valuation, Day did indicate it was an up round from its previous investment announcements.</p><p>Secondly, First Floor gives the Boston company an in-road into Asia where it has very little presence right now. While its development office is in Spain, and that has helped build a\u00a0presence in the EU, so far Apperian has\u00a0had only small deals in Asia. It\u2019s hoping that by connecting with an Asian firm, this will help gain\u00a0entr\u00e9e into this market.</p><p>Since the last funding round, the market seems to have caught up with Apperian.

The CEO, Nadav Zafrir tells TechCrunch he spent the last 10 years of his long military service working for Unit 8200 of the Israeli Defense Force, which is the Israeli equivalent of the NSA, and is responsible for, among other things, code decryption. In fact, he was head of the organization for five years before retiring 18 months ago.</p><p>That\u2019s when he decided to go into business with long-time Unit 8200 colleague Israel Grimberg. The two men bring years of military and intelligence experience to the table. To round out the company and bring some solid business experience to the mix, they brought in Liran Grinberg, a veteran of several startups.</p><p>\u201cCyber security is the biggest challenge of our time,\u201d Zafrir said.</p><p>To solve that problem, the company has a multi-pronged methodology. First it starts with research. They identify a broad area like enterprise security and then they work with the best minds in security they can find (including their own) and begin to formulate what they call \u201ca cyber-thesis.\u201d This process identifies a clear problem, which allows them to begin exploring\u00a0a range of possible solutions. The ideas they conceive\u00a0will eventually become the basis of a company.</p><p>\u201cWe see ourselves as co-founders [of this new company] in order to build an idea that we think is disruptive and raises us above the noise to solve something,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Once the idea is baked enough, they will finance a startup that includes some of the folks involved in the first part of the process. Team8 will continue to be\u00a0heavily involved in launching the company, but they won\u2019t build the company themselves. They will leave that to others, much like VCs.</p><p>It\u2019s important to note that even though Team8 is ultimately financing this new company based on the cyber-thesis and solution, Zafrir\u00a0is careful to differentiate his company from a conventional venture capitalist or even a startup incubator. He describes his company as\u00a0a kind of hybrid.</p><p>\u201cUnlike a conventional VC, we don\u2019t bet on horses that look promising. We bet on the thesis,\u201d he said. Another key difference he says is the involvement of the strategic partners like Alcatel Lucent and Cisco up front.</p><p>\u201cYou usually do this once [an idea] is validated, but we thought if you really want to bring novel solutions that will force [a company] to reinvent itself, you must have the ecosystem working together from the start,\u201d he said. And for him, that meant bringing in the strategic partners at the beginning of the process.</p><p>David Cowan from Bessemer Venture Partners, who has been investing in security companies since the 1990s, says Team8\u2019s\u00a0approach is what makes it\u00a0different, and it\u2019s why he finds the company so compelling.</p><p>\u201cTeam8 is developing solutions. Assessing the approach is the first step of that.\u00a0You start with a problem,\u201d Cowan said.</p><p>For instance if you want to protect industrial equipment from cyber attacks, Team8 would start by surveying the universe of possible defenses and decide if any of those make sense.</p><p>If not, they would sit down and create new ones or modify existing\u00a0ones until they figure out a way to prevent the attacks, Cowan explained.</p><p>This is in stark contrast to old ways of simply trying to build a moat around the problem or worse, reacting after the problem has already happened. The Team8 approach is to solve specific issues by finding ways to get ahead of them before the attack happens.</p><p>Team8\u00a0is already testing its approach with a company still in stealth that\u2019s looking to solve the sticky problem of advanced persistent threats (APTs). The thesis they created for this particular type of action\u00a0was that attackers are on offense, and companies under attack are always playing defense. This approach is exacerbated by\u00a0typical IT strategy to maintain a highly\u00a0organized environment. \u201cEveryone likes structure and nobody likes change. This is heaven for attackers,\u201d Zafrir explained.</p><p>He said they figured out that if they could create a network that\u2019s always changing, it would make it much harder for the attackers to find a way in because they couldn\u2019t follow the same old defense to do it.</p><p>They brought in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.checkpoint.com/\">Check Point</a> veteran Ofer Israeli to lead this\u00a0new company and they are working now to create that kind of self-defending network.</p><p>Cowan sees what Team8 is doing as the cutting edge of security research, and where he believes we need to be headed to solve the most intractable network security issues.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to targeted attacks organized by humans, you need to understand how these attacks are executed. This new generation of [security] startups requires offensive skills to create defensive services,\u201d Cowan explained.</p><p>That\u2019s precisely what Team8 is hoping to do.</p>", "title": ["Israeli Intelligence Vets Snag $18M Investment For New Approach To Cybersecurity"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},

{"date": ["2012-11-30"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/05/nomorerack-sneaky-big/\">Back in July, we caught up with</a> New York-based startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nomorerack.com/\">NoMoreRack</a>, a flash sales site that, unlike some of the most popular players in the space, isn\u2019t relying on luxury products or fashion to drive traffic. Instead, the young startup offers everyday products at reduced prices \u2014 an average of 70 to 80 percent off everything from consumer electronics to clothing \u2014 in an effort to become the Walmart or Target of deals.</p><p>While there\u2019s been a lot of consolidation in the flash sales and deals spaces over the last year, NoMoreRack has been moving in the other direction. In July, it reached 4.5 million subscribers, was selling 8K items a day and did $46 million in revenue during the first two quarters. Today, it\u2019s grown to 7 million visitors/month, 5.8 million subscribers, is selling an average of 40K items/day and revenue is now close to $80 million.</p><p>Thanks to this growth, NoMoreRack is today announcing that it has closed a $12 million series A round led by Asian eCommerce giant <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Market\">G-Market</a>. Ifty Ahmed, a partner at Oak Investment Partners, joined the startup\u2019s board on behalf of G-Market. With its new capital, NoMoreRack founder Melina Ash tells us that the startup plans to continue adding to its staff of 30 and will continue to scale operations, particularly abroad.</p><p>As to how it works? NoMoreRack offers an average of nine big deals everyday, serving these discounted items to users at the top of its website \u2014 along with hundreds of other products. The sales begin in the morning and end each night. While most of the deals last 24 hours, the startup has expanded to offer more \u201cevents,\u201d which are essentially longer-term sales, with durations of three to four days. It sounds like flash sales, but the NoMoreRack founders are quick to say that their end-goal is to become an eCommerce site, really an online shopping destination.</p><p>With its new funding, website and recent relocation to New York, NoMoreRack is trying to move away from a somewhat spotty reputation. As we wrote in July, at the outset, the site struggled with managing quality in buying overstock, discounted products and maintaining customer service \u2014 as a quick Google search will show you that customers have not always been thrilled with the NoMoreRack experience. </p><p>There have been a number of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ripoffreport.com/nomorerack-com/on-line-business/internet-internet-71b9c.htm\">complaints of cancelled orders</a>, damaged goods and poor quality, but to their credit, the founders have owned up to that and are making an attempt to go forward. After the site received customer complaints when it initially posted a penny sales auction, it quickly shut it down and is trying to repair a scuffed reputation, thanks to what seems to be less-than-sterling origins. To that point, the NoMoreRack co-founder tells us that 70 percent of its revenue comes from repeat buyers, which is a slightly more auspicious sign, though Ash did say that \u201cthere\u2019s always room for improvement\u201d when it comes to customer experience. Yes indeed.</p><p>Be that as it may, the site now offers full refunds along with a 30-day window to return items if users aren\u2019t satisfied with what they get. It\u2019s good to keep this history in mind, but with the rate of growth NoMoreRack is seeing and new capital to boot, it looks like this auction-turned-eCommerce site is going to be around for awhile. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://domainnamewire.com/2012/10/22/nordstrom-sues-flash-sales-site-nomorerack/\">Nordstrom\u2019s clearly thinks so, as they\u2019re going after NoMoreRack for trademark infringement</a>.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-30-at-10-50-00-am.png\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/screen-shot-2012-11-30-at-10-50-00-am.png?w=680&amp;h=487\" alt=\"Screen shot 2012-11-30 at 10.50.00 AM\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-709733\"></a></p>", "title": ["Flash Deals Site NoMoreRack Raises $12M, Hits 5.8M Members"], "author": ["Rip Empson"]},

Curbside had <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/06/backed-by-9-5-million-curbside-launches-a-mobile-shopping-app-for-same-day-pickup-not-delivery/\">previously raised $9.5 million</a>.</p><p>Curbside\u2019s service is currently available at select Target and Best Buy stores in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as the Westfield Mall Oakridge location, where a number of retailers are on board.

However, both are large retail chains with over 1,000 locations each.</p><p>In total, Curbside works at 25 locations today, but with these forthcoming additions and other planned expansions, that number is expected to reach 40 by the end of July, the company tells us. And later this summer, Curbside plans on launching in L.A., as part of its\u00a0roll out to the top dozen metro regions in the U.S.\u00a0which will continue in the year ahead.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1175489\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/curbside-best-buy-079.jpg?w=680&amp;h=453\" alt=\"Curbside-Best-Buy-079\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\"></p><p>Curbside\u2019s growth comes at a time when\u00a0Silicon Valley is buzzing\u00a0over same-day delivery startups that offer anything you could want \u2013 from Amazon products to groceries and much more \u2013 all available with a push of a button. But Curbside founder and CEO\u00a0Jaron Waldman believes there\u2019s\u00a0more potential with local pick-up. (He\u2019s not the only one \u2013 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://delivery.walmart.com/\">Walmart\u2019s e-commerce arm is also testing curbside grocery pickup</a> around the U.S., for example.)</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re building an asset that\u2019s really valuable \u2013 we\u2019re getting a handle on what\u2019s in stock in local stores. I think that\u2019s a really important piece of the whole puzzle,\u201d Waldman explains. And while he believes that same-day delivery will be a big market, pick-up will be even bigger in the long run, he says.</p><p>Or, to put it more bluntly, same-day delivery with its increased fees for the convenience of instant gratification is something that today appeals to wealthier customers. (And Silicon Valley has a lot of those.)\u00a0Elsewhere around the U.S., consumers may find that free, curbside pick-up is a decent alternative which still\u00a0eliminates the hassles of having to park, walk in (often with kids in tow), then wait in lines at customer service before being able to get your purchased\u00a0item to your vehicle.</p><p>However, Waldman adds, even if he\u2019s wrong and someone cracks\u00a0the economics related to same-day delivery, there will still be partnership opportunities for Curbside in the future, he says.</p><p>Curbside\u2019s\u00a0service to date has appealed to younger shoppers, ages 25 to 35. Around 60 percent of its users have been female, perhaps reflective of its partnership with Target, where shoppers have often ordered diapers, baby items, and toys while on the go.</p><p>While Curbside isn\u2019t releasing sales figures, it says it\u2019s seeing over 50 percent month-over-month growth, and over 55 percent of users have returned to make another purchase. Retailers like the service because it brings them new customers, notes Waldman, including those customers\u00a0they hadn\u2019t seen in their ecosystem previously. Plus, Curbside sustains itself by taking a commission from the sales, similar to online affiliate fees, so there\u2019s not much risk on retailers\u2019 part to participate.</p><p>Now that the company has the additional investment, it\u2019s focusing on growing its business. This includes\u00a0hiring in operations, business development, and other key marketing roles\u00a0to grow its now 90-person team. (Of note: 85 percent\u00a0Curbside\u2019s retail team are full-time employees, and the rest are part-time. Today,\u00a0many on-demand companies still rely on contract workers to shuttle goods around \u2013 a decision that allowed\u00a0them to scale in their early days.\u00a0But it\u2019s expected that laws and regulations will eventually catch up to these new business models, and will force changes.)</p><p>\u201cCurbside represents the future of mobile commerce,\u201d said Jerry Yang, in a statement about his investment in the company. \u201cCurbside is primed to fundamentally change the way people shop \u2013 by creating a seamless way for consumers to access products from local merchants by successfully developing complex location and inventory technology.\u201d</p>", "title": ["Same-Day Shopping App Curbside Picks Up $25 Million More"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},
{"date": ["2015-02-12"], "text": "<p>Walmart today expanded its online grocery-shopping service, which allows customers to shop online then pick up at their local stores, to a new market: Huntsville, Ala. The move comes only days after Walmart brought the same service to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2015/02/10/walmart-tests-out-online-grocery-orders-in-phoenix.html\">a handful of stores in the Phoenix area</a>, as well. The retailer is still describing the curbside pickup option as something it\u2019s \u201ctesting,\u201d though it notes that, so far, in markets where both pickup and delivery options are available, pickup is proving to be increasingly popular.</p><p>While other retailers, including Amazon with AmazonFresh and startups like Instacart, have been testing online ordering combined with local grocery delivery,\u00a0Walmart\u2019s strategy so far has been to test out both pickup and delivery options, and\u00a0see how its customers respond. In San Jose, for example, the retailer offers home grocery deliveries, while in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/walmart-to-go-denver-grocery-test/\">its Denver market</a>, both pickup and delivery are available.</p><p>However, the company\u2019s more recent expansions, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thecitywire.com/node/34907#.VNy3MFPF83Y\">which also includes Bentonville, Ark.,</a>\u00a0last fall, are focused on online grocery shopping with a curbside pick-up option.</p><p>The way the pick-up service works is that customers first do their shopping online, and then choose an option to pick up at a local store during a given time period. At the store, employees pick and bag the items in advance of the customer\u2019s arrival, keeping cold items in refrigerated areas, as need be. When the customer arrives, they pull up to a designated area at the side or back of the store and place a call to a provided number or check-in via a kiosk.</p><p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-1118473\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/walmarttogo-pickup.png?w=323&amp;h=290\" alt=\"walmarttogo-pickup\" width=\"323\" height=\"290\">The store employees are then alerted as to which customer has arrived, and come out to the car with the groceries ready to be packed away.</p><p>Customers like the pickup option because it turns what can otherwise be a long, sometimes two-hour grocery shopping trip into something that gets handled in a matter of minutes. And unlike grocery delivery, you don\u2019t have to wait around your home for the delivery or pay the associated delivery fees.</p><p>Those who use the grocery pickup option, where available, can order their groceries and pick them up the same day if they choose. To do so, customers can place orders\u00a0by 2 a.m. to have them available by\u00a08 a.m., and orders placed by 10 a.m. can be ready by\u00a04 p.m. However, many other customers are scheduling their pickups for a day or several days in advance.</p><p>While Walmart currently declines to share any information about how many customers are now using its grocery pickup and delivery options today, how many orders have been handled, or the transactional volume\u00a0of those orders, it\u00a0would say that, so far, those who have adopted one of these\u00a0options are highly likely to use it again. In Denver, for instance, more than 80 percent of its delivery and pickup customers are repeat customers.</p><p>What\u2019s interesting about the markets where the online grocery shopping service is being tested is that they\u2019re often outside of urban areas, where there\u2019s more of a mainstream, \u201creal world\u201d customer base that\u00a0doesn\u2019t likely have a lot of options for things like same-day or on-demand deliveries \u2013 grocery or otherwise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hybrid approach to retail \u2013 not everything is going to be <em>just</em> online and not everything is going to be <em>just</em> in stores,\u201d explains\u00a0Walmart spokesman Ravi Jariwala. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be one of the retailers that\u2019s very well-suited to pursue those types of hybrid models, especially when it pertains to a category like grocery and consumables.\u201d</p>", "title": ["Walmart Expands Online Grocery Shopping Efforts After Strong Repeat Business"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

This move follows the company\u2019s ongoing grocery delivery tests which have been taking place over the last couple of years in San Jose and San Francisco. The Denver area test is currently a closed beta, meaning customers will be allowed to trial the new service on a first-come, first served basis only. For now, they can request access by signing up at Walmart.com/togo.</p><p>The retailer says it began online grocery delivery in San Jose and San Francisco back in April 2011, where the service is also available to most cities along the peninsula.</p><p>Customers can choose from tens of thousands of eligible items online, including fresh produce, meat and seafood, dairy, bakery items, and even non-grocery items like health and beauty products,\u00a0electronics and toys. Shoppers designate a two-hour slot for their delivery, then orders are fulfilled by local Walmart Supercenters and delivered in Walmart To Go trucks.</p><p>These branded trucks have previously been used in the San Jose and San Francisco areas, and are now coming to the Denver area, too. \u00a0Denver was already participating in Walmart\u2019s broader efforts in same-day delivery, which began in select markets last fall. Denver in particular gained same-day delivery in November 2012.</p><p>For background, last October, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/walmart-begins-testing-same-day-delivery-in-select-markets/\">Walmart announced its intentions</a> to experiment in this area of same-day delivery, which began with tests in\u00a0Northern Virginia (outside D.C.), Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Jose/San Francisco, initially. Customers in those regions could shop online \u2013 though not necessarily for groceries \u2013 then have their orders sourced and fulfilled by their local Walmart stores.</p><p>The company is still experimenting with price points for this service, it seems, as they note that the Denver area delivery fees will be \u201cin the $5 to $10 range.\u201d However, it will run some introductory offers for new participants in order to encourage sign-ups, including some free delivery options, we\u2019re told.

And Amazon has been moving into the same-day grocery delivery space with its AmazonFresh service which this summer <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/10/amazon-bets-on-web-groceries-expands-amazonfresh-to-l-a/\">expanded to its first non-Seattle market</a> when it arrived in L.A.</p><p>In addition, Walmart\u2019s news follows that of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/10/07/amazon-hints-at-bay-area-grocery-service/\">reports from earlier this month</a> which indicated that Amazon is now looking to bring AmazonFresh to the San Francisco Bay Area, too.

So why not let people sell things on their blogs? That\u2019s what ShopLocket hopes to do now, by integrating with WordPress and launching a plugin to enable in-blog e-commerce.</p><p>WordPress, of course, powers a cubic buttload of web sites around the world, including the one that you\u2019re reading now.* And no doubt, a number of ShopLocket sellers have blogs of their own, to talk about their products. So it seems like a no-brainer that the two would work together. </p><p>Previously, users with self-hosted versions of WordPress could enable e-commerce through third-party plugins. But this is the first integration to take advantage of a platform like ShopLocket\u2019s for users of WordPress\u2019s hosted platform.    </p><p>To enable this brave new world of blog-based e-commerce, ShopLocket has introduced a WordPress plugin that will enable users of the platform to quickly make their goods available on their sites. With the integration, WordPress.com Enterprise and VIP users will be able to easily embed items for sale anywhere they wish to, whether that be in posts, separate pages, or even through various sidebars on their sites.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/shoplocket-blog-commerce/shoplocket-wordpress/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-787027\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/shoplocket-wordpress.png?w=680&amp;h=431\" alt=\"shoplocket wordpress\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-787027\"></a></p><p>The best part, though, is probably for buyers. That\u2019s because they\u2019ll no longer have to add an item to a shopping cart and then go to a separate website to login and check out. Through the integration, users will be able to make purchases directly on the site. By keeping users on-site during purchase, ShopLocket can help sellers increase engagement and lower the amount of dropoff that inevitably happens during the sale conversion process.</p><p>For WordPress users, ShopLocket provides an easy, cost-effective way to start selling items online. There are no upfront costs to get set up, and the company charges just a nominal fee per transaction (2.5%, plus credit card processing fees). The company was part of the Toronto-based <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/15/meet-the-first-5-companies-to-join-toronto-incubator-extreme-startups/\">startup incubator Extreme Startups</a> last year and has raised $1 million in seed funding from Valar Ventures, Rho Canada Ventures, and others.</p><p>==<br>\n* More than 60 million sites, and growing, apparently. </p>", "title": ["ShopLocket Partners With WordPress.com To Enable Blog-Based E-Commerce"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

Denver area customers will now be able to order their groceries online, then pick up at a nearby store \u2013 without having to set foot inside the store.</p><p>Instead, customers will pull up to a designated pick-up spot on the side of the store, as directed. Or, in the case of those stores where a drive-through pharmacy is available, they\u2019ll pick up their groceries from the pharmacy window. Depending on the location, they\u2019ll either dial a phone number or enter an order into a touchscreen kiosk to let Walmart staff know they\u2019ve arrived. Then it\u2019s only a matter of popping the trunk.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-948691\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-01-28 at 5.47.10 PM\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/screen-shot-2014-01-28-at-5-47-10-pm.png?w=680&amp;h=465\"></p><p>To get started, customers will first place their orders online, and Walmart will call them directly when the order is ready. The idea is that you could effectively \u201cdo your grocery shopping\u201d in the morning, or while on your lunch break, then swing by the store on your way home to pick them up.</p><p>However, Walmart believes many customers will still park and come into the store, even after placing the order online. This is because, in surveys the retail giant has conducted, 55 percent of shoppers said the idea of grocery pick-up (as opposed to home delivery) appealed to them because it would give them a chance to grab the items they forgot when placing the original online order. While in store, they may also come across other things to buy that weren\u2019t on their list, Walmart hopes.</p><p>But to be clear, the local grocery pick-up option is <em>not</em> meant to replace home deliveries, nor is the home grocery delivery experiment being called a bust.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about choice,\u201d Walmart\u2019s Director of Public Relations, Ravi Jariwala, explains. The retailer understands customer behavior is shifting, he adds, but the customers are the ones who will dictate what\u2019s most convenient for them.</p><p>\u201cAt this point, we\u2019re really trying to assess what our customers are gravitating toward, and the good news is that I don\u2019t think this is an either/or [situation],\u201d says\u00a0Jariwala.</p><p>Denver is one of the few areas where Walmart To Go offers home delivery of grocery items, and one of the most recent at that. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/15/walmart-expands-same-day-grocery-delivery-to-denver/\">Grocery delivery arrived in the region just last October</a> \u2013 making it the first market outside of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce headquarters in Silicon Valley to receive access to the service. To date, \u201chundreds\u201d of grocery deliveries have been processed through Walmart To Go in Denver, and the service has been rated by 90 percent of users as 4 or 5 out of 5 in follow-up customer surveys.</p><p><img class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-948675\" alt=\"walmart-to-go\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/walmart-to-go.jpg?w=453&amp;h=680\"></p><p>The retailer has also been testing grocery delivery in San Jose and San Francisco since 2011 where thousands of customers and orders have been placed to date. There, the company is in the process of expanding its delivery fleet from 7 to 10 trucks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Walmart <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/walmart-begins-testing-same-day-delivery-in-select-markets/\">has been testing same-day delivery of general merchandise</a> in\u00a0Northern Virginia (outside D.C.), Philadelphia, and Minneapolis, in addition to San Jose and San Francisco as of October 2012.</p><p>All the various services \u2013 same-day delivery, grocery delivery, and now in-store grocery pickup \u2013 are offered under the \u201cWalmart To Go\u201d brand, which can be a bit confusing.</p><p>And to further muddy the waters,\u00a0Walmart has offered a \u201csite-to-store\u201d service, too, which lets customers shop online, then pick up at their local store. In some cases, those pick-ups can also be same-day when items are in stock.\u00a0This particular service has been available nationwide since 2007, which gives Walmart extensive experience in managing the operational side of local pick-ups, at least.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-948674\" alt=\"walmart-to-go_2\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/walmart-to-go_2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\">Walmart has to hire and train \u201cWalmart To Go\u201d associates who handle picking and bagging the items, which are then held in the back of the store and kept cold if necessary for local pick-ups, as well as drivers for the home deliveries.</p><p>Though Amazon has been eating away at Walmart on the e-commerce front, Walmart\u2019s competitive advantage when it comes to pick-ups and deliveries are the locations of its stores. Unlike Amazon, whose warehouses are situated well for its e-commerce business, two-thirds of the U.S. population is within 5 miles of one of Walmart\u2019s 4,100 U.S. stores, which means the company has more flexibility in offering both pickups and deliveries alike.</p><p>For now, Walmart\u2019s home delivery service is significantly cheaper than competitor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fresh.amazon.com\">Amazon Fresh</a>, which is available in L.A., San Francisco, and Seattle, and costs customers $299 annually. Walmart charges only $5-$7 per order. Both services have minimum orders (Walmart\u2019s is $30; Amazon\u2019s is $35).</p><p>Of course, both companies are taking a loss on these experiments while they test. The question for now is which option \u2013 or as it may turn out, which suite of options \u2013 can reach profitability?</p><p>Grocery pick-up in Denver is live now in 11 stores.</p>", "title": ["Walmart Begins Testing Online Grocery Shopping With Local Store Pickup Option In Denver"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},
{"date": ["2015-09-16"], "text": "<p>Following news from earlier this month which saw Amazon testing the waters with <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/08/amazon-launches-a-food-delivery-service-via-prime-now-starting-in-seattle/\">a Grubhub-like restaurant delivery service via Prime Now</a>, the company announced this morning its one-hour delivery service is today\u00a0going live in its 13th market worldwide, with a launch in\u00a0Los Angeles and Orange County. What\u2019s notable about this expansion, however, is the accompanying news that Amazon has established four Prime Now hubs in southern California which will allow it to deliver tens of thousand of items on-demand, including cold foods and frozen items from grocery stores, in addition to household goods, gifts, electronics and more.</p><p>The company says it has\u00a0established three Prime Now hubs in L.A. and one in Orange County to fulfill orders to a large area of southern California \u2013 including cold items.</p><p>Over the course of the next few days, Prime Now customers in L.A. will be able to shop local stores from the app, including Sprouts Farmers Market, Bristol Farms, Sprinkles Cupcakes, Fresh &amp; Easy, Erewhon Organic Grocer and 99 Ranch Market. Yes, this means yet another Prime Now city is going live with support for deliveries from local grocery stores.</p><p>This is not the first time Amazon has offered cold grocery delivery through Amazon Prime Now, to be clear. Prime Now users in Manhattan can shop for groceries and other gifts and goodies from Westwide Market,\u00a0D\u2019Agostinos, Gourmet Garage and Billy\u2019s Bakery, while those in Portland can buy from\u00a0New Seasons Market, World Foods,\u00a0Uwajimaya, and\u00a0Cupcake Jones, for example.</p><p>However, Prime Now\u2019s continued expansion into the realm of grocery delivery leaves some questions with regard to Amazon\u2019s intentions with the\u00a0AmazonFresh grocery delivery service. That service, live in Seattle, New York (Brooklyn), Philly, plus\u00a0Northern and Southern California, offers both unattended doorstep delivery using temperature-controlled tote bags as well as one-hour delivery windows.</p><p>But\u00a0the company has been experimenting with how it charges for AmazonFresh \u2013 <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/19/amazonfresh-becomes-a-prime-benefit-in-select-california-markets-at-7-99-per-delivery/\">it toyed with the idea of making it a Prime benefit,</a> for example, while continuing to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2015/amazonfresh-delays-299year-prime-fresh-rollout-for-another-3-months/\">roll\u00a0back the deadline to subscribe </a>to the $299 per year service.</p><p>And as more Prime Now supported cities have access to groceries on demand \u2013 including as of today in Southern California where AmazonFresh operates, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s going to be some overlap between the two services. And if you can get your groceries on demand in two hours via Prime Now for free, it\u2019s hard to justify paying an annual fee for AmazonFresh. (Perhaps that\u2019s why Amazon <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/19/amazonfresh-becomes-a-prime-benefit-in-select-california-markets-at-7-99-per-delivery/\">tested</a> a $7.99 per delivery model this June with AmazonFresh Californian customers, which matches up with Prime Now\u2019s price for one-hour delivery?)</p><p>When asked about the overlap, an Amazon spokesperson only responded by noting\u00a0that Prime Now was designed for \u201csuperfast\u201d deliveries of tens of thousands of items in partnerships with local stores, why AmazonFresh\u2019s selection was more extensive, with some 500,000+ items and both same-day and early morning delivery options.</p><p>That being said,\u00a0it seems that Amazon is quietly working to expand its grocery delivery options via Prime Now. For example, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/09/10/new-amazon-warehouse-hints-at-one-hour-prime-now-deliveries-in-boston/\">a recent report noted that Amazon leased a new warehouse outside of Boston which includes coolers and freezers </a>for perishable items, ahead of a launch in that city. There are other indications that Amazon is getting serious about Prime Now as well, including the launch of <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/08/amazon-launches-a-food-delivery-service-via-prime-now-starting-in-seattle/\">restaurant</a> deliveries and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/25/amazons-prime-now-expands-to-seattle-region-adds-beer-wine-liquor-delivery-option/\">alcohol</a> delivery in select regions.</p><p>The expansion makes this Prime Now\u2019s 13th supported location worldwide. The service is already live in\u00a0Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Indianapolis, Manhattan, Miami, Portland and Seattle, in the U.S., as well as London.</p><p>In L.A. and surrounding areas, including\u00a0Santa Monica, Redondo Beach, Silver Lake and Irvine, for example, Prime Now will be available 7 days per week, 8 AM to midnight.</p>", "title": ["Amazon\u2019s Prime Now Expands To L.A., Ramps Up For SoCal Grocery Deliveries"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

Dalton has set up a Kickstarter-like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://join.app.net\">fundraising effort</a> to attract $500,000 in necessary backing from some 10,000 potential users of App.net\u2019s service.

You can watch our whole conversation in the video embedded above, and below I\u2019ve excerpted some of his points.</p><p>Caldwell says that if social web services like Twitter want to be treated like platforms for an ecosystem (which they clearly are, as evidenced by <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/26/communication-breakdown-twitter-is-down-again/\">the freakouts that occur</a> when Twittter goes down), we should get used to paying for them like we pay for other infrastructure services:</p><p>If App.net is thinking so big, why is it only asking for $500,000, a relatively small amount of money by modern web standards? Caldwell explained it like this:</p><p>In short, Caldwell says, maybe yes, maybe no:</p><p>The most common misconception Caldwell says he\u2019s heard is people saying App.net is ignoring the phenomenon of \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect\">network effects</a>,\u201d where services go up in value as their user base grows.

{"date": ["2015-01-03"], "text": "<p><strong>Editor\u2019s note:</strong> <em>Matt Hulett is the CEO of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clickbank.com/\">ClickBank</a>.</em></p><p>The dialogue of today\u2019s corporate leaders is changing, and as the polished personas of the past begin to disappear into a sea of corporate babble, a new breed of CEO has emerged with a street talk and swagger that would make your mother blush.</p><p>Case in point are leaders like John Legere of T-Mobile, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/topic/person/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a> of Tesla Motors, and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/topic/person/reed-hastings/\">Reed Hastings</a>\u00a0of Netflix. They\u2019re the underdogs and mavericks, and what you see is what you get. They\u2019re unfiltered and can trash talk with the best of them. But more notably, they\u2019re unapologetic, and people love them for it. They\u2019ve got your attention and the revenues to prove it.</p><p>But what recent trends have brought rise to this new breed of corporate leaders? While tech industry lingo has always had somewhat of a hard edge, a new generation of employees, clients and consumers has emerged with expectations for work-life integration. And as work and life become one and the same, we\u2019ve got a new generation looking to brands and their CEOs for entertainment. Suddenly, the line between office chatter and bar talk becomes\u00a0more blurred than ever.</p><p>So when is it appropriate for CEOs to swear? Can we build a corporate environment in which employees can thrive, a platform that resonates with a tech culture, all while serving a new generation that\u00a0craves leaders who speak their language? Is strong language simply characteristic of corporate cultures created by fast-moving, innovative leaders? And if so, can all CEOs benefit from adopting some language that is rough around the edges in order to get a leading edge? Not so fast.</p><p>CEOs should tread <em>very</em> carefully. Today\u2019s generation is hypersensitive to authenticity. Millennials can detect a bullshitter a mile away. Not all CEOs can drop an F-bomb and appeal to, engage, and motivate their followers. But if it\u2019s authentic, if it\u2019s you, today\u2019s CEO shouldn\u2019t be overly concerned about watching what they say. When we\u2019re unfiltered, when we allow ourselves to be real, it resonates with today\u2019s workforce and consumers hungry for authenticity, and thirsty for entertainment.</p><p>But it\u2019s not just millennials who want to be entertained. Let\u2019s face it, we\u2019re all bored \u2014 our customers, clients, even investors. We spend a ridiculous amount of time and money online every day on content that will keep our attention. And not only have our attention spans decreased and our demand for \u201csnackable\u201d content increased, we\u2019ve starting seeking out entertainment, and even our celebrities in unconventional places as evidenced by the rise of the YouTube star.</p><p>In fact, even CEOs are becoming celebrities in their own right. Take Richard Branson, as the founder of Virgin Group he\u2019s got 4.8 million Twitter followers \u2013 a significant fan base on one social media channel hanging on his every word. When the lines between celebrity and CEO become blurred as people turn to brands and their leaders as a form of entertainment, it changes the game.</p><p>CEOs with dynamic personalities, bad language and all, start to rise above the masses, often with reputations preceding the brands they represent. When done correctly, CEOs can now leverage an incredibly valuable and truly authentic asset, their personal brands, to spotlight and add character to the organizations they lead. Because when CEOs use their unique personalities to teach and entertain, their messages and missions become sticky. And their companies are reaping the rewards.</p><p>At the end of the day, less important are the actual words we use as leaders, but critical is our level of authenticity. As CEOs, we should not shy away from being who we are, profanity and all. It\u2019s the rawness, the unfiltered content, and the honesty people crave. It\u2019s what makes us relatable. It\u2019s when we own who we are that our employees, customers and investors truly engage and respond.</p>", "title": ["A CEO Way With Words"], "author": ["Matt Hulett"]},

Predicted to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/02/xiaomi-1h14-phone-sales/\">sell at least 60 million smartphones</a> in Asia this year, Xiaomi unexpectedly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/08/05/report-xiaomi-overtook-samsung-to-become-top-smartphone-vendor-in-china-in-q2-2014/\">stole the top spot</a> for smartphone sales in China during the last quarter of business to underline its arrival as a major player. Now Lenovo is taking a leaf out of its young rival\u2019s book\u00a0in a bid to keep up with the times.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://news.lenovo.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1852\">The company announced this week</a> that it is creating a new \u201csmart device company\u201d in China which will open its doors on April 1 2015. Far from an early April Fools\u2019 Day joke, Lenovo\u2019s new unit is rather Xiaomi-looking, based on the few details that it has\u00a0revealed so far.</p><p>While Lenovo will keep its primary\u00a0smartphone business which sells to consumers via carriers and retail stores, the new business \u2014 which does not yet have a name \u2014 will adopt an internet-only sales model for selling to consumers.\u00a0It isn\u2019t clear whether this business will sell phones using the same flash sales model favored by Xiaomi, but Lenovo is aiming to cash in on some of the buzz and excitement that Xiaomi has generated with its fun (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thenextweb.com/asia/2012/08/19/why-chinas-xiaomi-inspiring-loyalty-rivals-apple-fanboys-google-fandroids/\">and perhaps even cult</a>) approach to online marketing and sales.</p><p>In addition to methodology, we can likely expect Lenovo\u2019s new unit to sell phones at similar price points to Xiaomi. The company\u2019s flagship <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mi.com/mi4\">Mi4</a> device retails for around $300, but its top-selling lower-end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mi.com/en/redminote\">Redmi/Hongmi</a> range is priced\u00a0from around $130.</p><p>Lenovo isn\u2019t just looking at hardware, however. The company says that \u201csoftware and application development and close customer engagement\u201d will also be part of the new business\u2019s focus. It\u2019s not clear what they may entail, but the apps and services appear to be specifically for audiences in China, so don\u2019t get too excited if you live in the rest of the world.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-991665\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/p1020696.jpg?w=680&amp;h=510\" alt=\"Xiaomi\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\"></p><p>Lenovo does, of course, have Motorola on its roster too. Like Xiaomi, Motorola has adopted a direct-to-consumer strategy via internet sales, but that\u2019s in addition to regular physical retail partners too.</p><p>Xiaomi this month announced that it has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"technode.com/2014/10/16/xiaomi-shipped-45m-phones-in-the-first-three-quarters-2014/\">shipped 45 million smartphones</a> over the first three quarters of this year.\u00a0It <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/china-xiaomi-quadruples-smartphone-shipments-in-year\">recorded</a> 18.7 million sales last year, but 2014 has seen it massively increase the number of markets that it is active in \u2014 beyond mainland China, it\u00a0now sells to consumers in Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and India. The firm is eyeing an expansion to Latin America \u2014 initially via Mexico and Brazil \u2014 but its continued development in China is such that Lenovo has decided to pull the trigger on\u00a0this new initiative.</p><p>Given <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/30/xiaomis-one-more-thing/\">the furor over the apparent similarities</a>\u00a0between Xiaomi\u2019s Mi smartphones and Apple\u2019s\u00a0iPhones, it\u2019s more than a little ironic to see a larger competitor go the full distance\u00a0and spin out its own \u2018Xiaomi\u2019 business.

{"date": ["2015-01-15"], "text": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mi.com/en/\">Xiaomi</a>, the Chinese company that recently became the world\u2019s most valuable startup (depending on your <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/30/what-the-hell-is-a-startup-anyway/\">definition of startup</a>), took the wraps off its latest phone in Beijing today\u2026 and the comparisons to Apple are likely to flow once again.</p><p>The Xiaomi Mi Note is priced at 3299 CNY (~$530) for a 64 bit model, and the higher-specced Mi Note Pro, both look to be\u00a0the Chinese company\u2019s response to Apple\u2019s iPhone 6+. Indeed, that\u2019s a comparison that Xiaomi positively encouraged at its launch event, where CEO and co-founder Lei Jun made multiple references and comparisons of the two phones.</p><p>Jun said he was proud that his company\u2019s new device is lighter, thinner and lighter than the iPhone 6+, but yet it has a larger screen. The Xiaomi CEO also made reference to the obtruding camera of the iPhone 6+, pointing out that \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 the rear-facing camera on Xiaomi\u2019s new device doesn\u2019t stick out in that way.</p><p>When it comes to camera tech, Xiaomi has added optical image stabilization to the 13-megapixel front-facing camera too, and Lei Jun impressed the crowd with a series of images captured from the Mi Note.</p><p>The Mi Note itself sports a 5.7-inch screen, with a Snapdragon 801 2.5 GHz processor powering it, alongside 3GB RAM. The 16GB version retails for 2,299 CNY (around $370), while the 64GB model is 2,799 (circa $450).</p><p>As for the Mi Note Pro, that comes with a more powerful 64-bit, 8-core Snapdragon 810 processor, and a whopping 4GB RAM. The device includes 64GB of storage and costs 3,299 CNY ($535) \u2014 Xiaomi says support LTE-CAT will give users lightning fast 450Mbps download speeds.\u00a0The Mi Note Pro is\u00a0the most expensive phone that Xiaomi has ever sold, and its best on paper too.</p><p>The Mi Note\u00a0is just 6.95mm thick and weighs in at 161g. Jun said the company had focused on improving battery life \u2014 it actually produces a line of portable chargers, so has the knowledge in-house \u2014 and the Mi Note packs a 3,000 mAh battery courtesy of LG.</p><p>Another notable feature is the device\u2019s glass, which is curved on its edges. That curve isn\u2019t like an LG-style flexible screen nor the eccentric Galaxy Note experiment, instead it gives the phone more sleek curves and design.</p><p>Beyond a new, larger device, Xiaomi also showed off its first set of own-name headphones, which even come in a zip-up box that is reminiscent of the Apple-owned Beats brand.</p><p>Priced at 499 CNY ($80), Lei Jun said the headphones are on par with the best (and most expensive) in the market, including Sennheiser.</p><p><img class=\" size-large wp-image-1105664 aligncenter\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/mi-headphones-video.jpg?w=680&amp;h=508\" alt=\"mi-headphones-video\" width=\"680\" height=\"508\"></p><p>Much of the comparison to Apple stems from the fact that the U.S. company is still seen as the producer of the best products on the market, which makes it the standard to beat. Although Lei Jun did crack a few jokes, including one about how easy it is for\u00a0Apple customers to\u00a0switch their SIM to a Mi Note thanks to its support for multiple SIM types.</p><p>The Mi Note will be available in China from 27 January. There\u2019s no word yet on when it will be available in Xiaomi\u2019s overseas markets.</p><p>Lei Jun also used\u00a0his stage appearance to hit back at common refrains in the media that Xiaomi is weak on patents. He claimed that the company filed 2,318 last year and has a team of experienced people running it. It ten years, he said, Xiaomi will hold \u201ctens of thousands of patents.\u201d IBM is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ificlaims.com/index.php?page=news&amp;type=view&amp;id=ifi-claims%2Fifi-claims-announces_4&amp;keep_session=1622904655\">currently the reigning champion</a> when it comes to getting patents granted, but Apple and Google are catching up in what remains a strong undercurrent in power plays between mobile tech companies.</p><p>Of course, another ten-year goal for Xiaomi is to become the world\u2019s biggest smartphone maker. The company\u2019s\u00a0rapid expansion has already taken\u00a0it to third worldwide, and first in China, this year. The feature-packed Mi Note is sure to resonate with fans in China, where the iPhone 6+ has reportedly been a big hit, and it will be interesting to see how it fares overseas, too.</p>", "title": ["Xiaomi Launches Mi Note Phablet To Fight The iPhone 6 Plus"], "author": ["Jon Russell"]},

Tapping into people\u2019s double love of fashion and chasing down a good deal online, the New York-based startup was once the very embodiment of its name: the shiny golden child of e-commerce, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.techmeme.com/110302/p40#a110302p40\">inspiring clones</a> from envious onlookers also wanting to get in on the flash sales\u00a0landgrab.</p><p>During Gilt\u2019s rise, there was talk of the company\u00a0looking to go public\u00a0in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/five-years-in-and-profitable-gilt-refocuses-on-new-leadership-an-ipo-in-2013-and-more/\">2013</a>\u00a0(even as it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120123/gilt-groupe-cuts-include-10-percent-of-employees-and-two-executives/\">laid people off</a>). Then the 2013\u00a0date seemed then to slip\u00a0to<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://recode.net/2014/02/10/gilt-groupe-to-go-public-likely-in-third-quarter-ipo/\">\u00a02014</a>, before quietly\u00a0disappearing altogether. Instead, Gilt\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://recode.net/2015/02/16/with-ipo-on-hold-gilt-groupe-raises-50-million-investment/\">raised $50 million</a> in February 2015 on an undisclosed valuation and cut jobs. (To date, Gilt has raised <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gilt-groupe#/entity\">$286 million</a>, with investors including DFJ, General Atlantic, Matrix Partners and Softbank.)</p><p>These days, Gilt\u2019s\u00a0numbers speak of its challenges to keep up\u00a0traffic and general buzz. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.similarweb.com/website/gilt.com#alsoVisited\">SimilarWeb</a> puts Gilt\u00a0at number 46 among all clothing shopping sites, and at 1,162 (and declining) among sites in its main U.S. market.</p><p>\u201cTraffic\u00a0has been dwindling since last year,\u201d says one source, who characterizes the layoffs as \u201cstreamlining headcount in order to make up for the loss in traffic and revenue.\u201d</p><p>As for those\u00a0layoffs, neither the CMO nor international head\u00a0will get\u00a0replaced. Part of the marketing duties will pass\u00a0to Gilt\u2019s CIO, who will bring a\u00a0tech perspective to the area with a\u00a0focus on what Gilt describes as \u201cdemand marketing.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, international operations, which make up 20% of the company\u2019s revenue, will continue to run\u00a0but will no longer report to an SVP. The company\u2019s Japan operations, run by interim Japan CEO Jonathan Venuto, will continue as before. (Previous CEO of Japan\u00a0Joanna Dubin recently departed.)</p><p>Oksana Voronenko is being promoted to senior director of international and she will report to Steven Schneider, who will oversee International in addition to being president of\u00a0daily deals site Gilt City and other business development. He reports to Tracey Weber, Gilt\u2019s president, who reports to CEO\u00a0Michelle Peluso.</p><p>Overall, the\u00a0cuts are spread throughout the organization and include 35 full-time roles and 10 temp roles, or just under 5% of staff.</p><p>Gilt today focuses on fashion for women, men and children, as well as home goods and\u00a0daily deals by way of Gilt City. There are no plans to cut any of these categories.</p><p>Gilt\u2019s moves\u00a0follow two ongoing stories\u00a0in the world of tech.</p><p>First, they point to\u00a0hurdles in the\u00a0wider world of e-commerce, where a number of startups \u2014 even those that have vaulted into the so-called \u201cunicorn club\u201d with billion-dollar-plus valuations \u2014 have struggled to achieve viable economies of scale and margin in the face of larger competition from the likes of Amazon and eBay.</p><p>Other casualties in the space have included companies like Fab.com, which\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/18/fab-is-buying-one-nordic-furniture-to-ramp-up-in-original-products/\">downsized and saw its European operations pivot</a>\u00a0into Hem, a vertically-integrated home product design and sales, while the U.S. Fab.com operation was sold in a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/03/pch-fab/\">firesale to PCH</a>. And Zulily,\u00a0which sailed through a $9 billion IPO and was once seen as a potential\u00a0Amazon rival, saw its stock tank and was eventually acquired by Liberty Interactive\u2019s QVC for $2.4 billion (a deal that closed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/192311/liberty-interactives-qvc-unit-acquires-zulily-for-24b\">just last week</a>).</p><p>The struggle for scale, even for popular sites, is\u00a0an interesting issue, when you consider newer e-commerce sites like Jet.com, which just today announced that it would be <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/07/jet-now-raising-ditches-its-membership-fees-but-says-profitability-still-on-track-for-2020/\">scrapping its $50 membership fee</a> \u2014 a key part of its business model \u2014 in order to try to broaden the site\u2019s appeal.</p><p>Gilt\u2019s cuts and belt tightening also bring to mind the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capitalist-sounds-alarm-on-silicon-valley-risk-1410740054\">ongoing debate</a> over whether <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/business/dealbook/a-venture-capital-giant-says-bubble-what-bubble.html\">or not</a>\u00a0we are in a tech bubble blown up by overvaluations and\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/26/the-tech-industry-is-in-denial-but-the-bubble-is-about-to-burst/\">about to burst</a>.

{"date": ["2015-08-28"], "text": "<p class=\"p1\">Yesterday on Facebook, a man named Matt Neal <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156066540910093&amp;set=gm.906922332754626\">sent out a plea</a>. He\u2019s 26, his blood type is B+ and he has a failing kidney. His ask? \u201cOne working kidney from a true sneaker head.\u201d His offer? A pair of some of the hottest sneakers on the planet at the moment, Yeezy 350 Boosts.</p><p class=\"p1\">The pair of sneakers is made by Adidas, and designed in collaboration with Kanye West. Though the Boost lineup goes beyond the Yeezys, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flightclub.com/adidas-yeezy-boost-350-turtle-blugra-cwhite-201114\">grey and black 350s</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flightclub.com/adidas-yeezy-750-boost-yeezy-lbrown-cwhite-lbrown-201060?siteID=QFGLnEolOWg-24b1rHTxiUy0CouRqLB.Jw&amp;ls_affid=QFGLnEolOWg\">suede 720s</a> \u2014 along with new colors just released and others only glimpsed by mere mortals \u2014 are some of the biggest obsessions of sneakerheads. These collectors, traders and enthusiasts make up an enormous subculture-become-culture that obsesses over the latest shoe releases from brands and collaborators\u00a0like Jordan, Nike, Reebok, Asics, Packer, BAIT, Kobe, Kith, Janikowsky and more.</p><p class=\"p1\">To call these collectors obsessed or driven is selling them short. There are multi-day sneaker conventions where people do nothing but trade and scope out what other people are wearing. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/sneakerheadz\">recent documentary</a> outlines the tenets and beginnings of the movement.</p><p class=\"p1\">Given that many of the dopest sneakers get released as a part of a limited run, it\u2019s not uncommon for enthusiasts to jam up online ordering systems and line up the night before to camp out for the hottest cops. There are even tutorials on how to use <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/rare-sneakers-bots-twitter-online/\">page monitors and bots</a> to score rare shoes. This furor, of course, leads to an insane secondary market, with shoes doubling, or tripling in price on eBay and other sales centers like Instagram and third-party marketplaces like Flight Club, Kixify and more.</p><p class=\"p1\">Which naturally leads to fraud.</p><p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe genesis of it was that I got screwed by eBay,\u201d says Daishin Sugano, of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://airgoat.com/\">shoe marketplace app GOAT</a>*. He was after the first pair of Jordans** that he had owned as a kid (this is a sort of rite of passage that most sneakerheads go through, sometimes it\u2019s even their gateway to mainlining new releases). He then described his sinking feeling as he noticed details that weren\u2019t quite right. After research, they became clear; the laces were rolled, not flat; the tongue was oddly shaped; they were counterfeit. And the return process was so convoluted that he never ended up getting his money back.</p><p class=\"p1\">And it\u2019s not even always that easy. Sometimes counterfeits are even made using the same materials that the real ones are, but there are always tells. And it\u2019s only possible to tell in advance without a lot of back and forth. That kind of communication is hard on eBay and impossible on popular used sneaker venues like Instagram and Facebook. Poor return policies \u2014 or none at all \u2014 complete the picture.</p><p class=\"p1\">Buying used collector-level sneakers, which can run from a couple hundred bucks to $8,000 easy, is fraught with danger. This, says Sugano, is what they wanted to fix with GOAT. To make things safer for sneakerheads.</p><p class=\"p1\">GOAT is a sneaker marketplace that connects buyers and sellers. It\u2019s from the same team that built GrubWithUs and Superb, both of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20131127/grubwithus-will-reformulate-as-superb-an-app-for-discovering-places/\">which have been wound down</a>. They\u2019re still hunting for the right thing and working off of their original round of funding. GOAT comes out of a personal passion, which is always a good sign.\u00a0<img class=\"alignright wp-image-1202316\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-28-at-4-16-43-pm.png?w=469&amp;h=364\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-08-28 at 4.16.43 PM\" width=\"469\" height=\"364\"></p><p class=\"p1\">There are plenty of used sneaker outlets out there, so GOAT is trying to differentiate itself in a couple of ways.</p><p class=\"p1\">First, they take a low commission. GOAT takes a 9.5% cut of the sale, compared to eBay (via Paypal) of 13% and Flight Club at 20%.</p><p class=\"p1\">Second, they protect buyers and sellers. Both of the above options have seller protection of a sort, eBay in its return policies and ratings, and Flight Club in its team of experts who have theoretically verified the provenance of your sneakers. But Flight Clubs prices are high, and the other options like Craigslist, Facebook and Instagram (where a ton of sneaker selling happens), offer none. GOAT, by comparison, will automatically protect any sale over $300 by verifying every sneaker sold. When someone buys an expensive pair, they are shipped to GOAT to be verified before being shipped to the buyer. The sale is canceled if they\u2019re not legit and there are buyer protections even after verification, with returns accepted by GOAT.</p><p class=\"p1\">Third, they offer pricing intelligence for sellers, and a set template of images that <i>must</i> be supplied in specific angles for every shoe and size. This offers much more information than is typically available in a marketplace, both to help the seller price the shoe correctly and to let the buyer see all angles of their product in clear images.</p><p class=\"p1\">Currently, GOAT has 25,000 sneakers in its database including a bunch of data points about the shoe and copious images. They continue to gather that data, obviously, as more sellers put their shoes on the marketplace. This opens up opportunities for them to mine that, plus search and purchase data, to apply intelligence to a consumer segment that runs mainly on luck and obsession. What\u2019s hot? What does the pricing curve look like on a particular set of kicks? AKA, when is the right time to buy and sell? These are all bits of low hanging sole that Sugano says they\u2019re interested in tackling.</p><p class=\"p1\">For instance, there have been over 100,000 \u2018wants\u2019 in the app already \u2014 people marking shoes they\u2019d like to buy. That allows them to ping sellers who have it in their \u2018collection\u2019 (also a great feature for people obsessed with collecting), to tell them it might be time to trade up.</p><p class=\"p1\">I\u2019m what you might consider a journeyman sneaker head. I\u2019m sitting on around three dozen pairs. That is nothing when compared to people like rapper Fetty Wap, who says he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.maxim.com/entertainment/music/article/freestyle-fetty-wap-2015-8\">buys a pair a day</a>, and keeps a house for his clothes, with one whole room filled with Jordans. Most of us will never be on that level, but for sneakerheads with a holy grail pair (mine are the black Jordan Pinnacles) that they\u2019ll always be hunting, GOAT could provide a reliable option.</p><p class=\"p1\">Hopefully, one lucky person will end up with a pair of Yeezy 350\u2019s, and an even luckier Matt Neal will end up with a fresh kidney (our best to you Matt). For the rest of us, there is GOAT.</p><p class=\"p1\">*<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvb8SxvZc8\">GOAT</a></p><p class=\"p1\">**<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://airgoat.com/sneakers/air-jordan-5-grape-4490?_branch_match_id=165943282398967717\">OG 5 Grapes</a></p>", "title": ["GOAT Lets You Cop Kicks Without Getting Jacked"], "author": ["Matthew Panzarino"]},

Our customers have a demonstrated appetite for these offers, and by broadening our reach in this space Groupon is even better positioned as the place you start when you want to do or buy just about anything, anytime, anywhere.\u201d</p><p>The company points to research that estimates the value of the off-price fashion market at around $40 billion annually (including both online and offline retailers).</p><p>\u201cGroupon\u2019s brand, reach and vision as an ecommerce destination make it a tremendous place to continue to grow our company,\u201d said ideeli CEO Stefan Pepe in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to bringing the great deals we offer to Groupon customers.\u201d</p><p>Although Groupon is getting the company at a relative steal, the big question is whether it will be able to captalise on the assets in ways that ideeli as a standalone company has not.</p><p>When ideeli was first founded seven years ago, flash sales were all the rage and consumers were flocking to sign up to sites where they would be members and receive information on exclusive discounts \u2014 part of the reason why ideeli\u2019s founder (and eventual chairman) Paul Hurley was able to attract so much investment.</p><p>More recently, however, companies like Gilt Groupe \u2014 a competitor of ideeli\u2019s \u2014 which built early reputations around the business model have found themselves <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-31/gilt-groupe-ceo-seeks-to-prove-flash-sales-are-no-fad.html\">on the defensive</a> trying to prove that the concept is not just a fad, but something sustainable.</p><p>Up to now, Groupon has not broken out sales of fashion items on its platform compared to other categories \u2014 they sell products but as part of a bigger mix of goods \u2014 but a spokesperson notes that fashion discounts \u201chave been very popular with Groupon customers.\u201d He also points out that ideeli will help it develop further inroads into the sector as a whole: \u201cideeli brings a significant presence within the industry as well as great relationships with top brands,\u201d he says.</p><p>In Groupon\u2019s <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/07/groupon-q3-misses-on-revenues-of-595-1m-announces-acquisition-of-ticket-monster-to-boost-mobile-business-in-asia/\">last quarterly results</a> reported in November 2013, it reported sales of $595.1 million, missing analysts\u2019 estimates but beating on EPS of $0.02. That points also to how the company needs to continue to develop more products that are diversified from each other and \u201cbeyond the daily deal\u201d (as co-founder and ex-CEO Andrew Mason once said) to build up its business.</p>", "title": ["Groupon Moves Into Flash Fashion, Buys Ideeli For $43M In Cash"], "author": ["Ingrid Lunden"]},

However, the new food delivery service is initially debuting in select Seattle ZIP\u00a0codes, with plans to expand to additional\u00a0neighborhoods, then later, to new markets where Prime Now operates.</p><p>The service will allow Amazon Prime members to view the menus from participating restaurants, and place orders in the app. Similar to the order-tracking available today in Prime Now, customers will also be able to track their food delivery order in real-time as it\u2019s prepped by the restaurant then as the driver hits the road, heading their way.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1205701\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/restaurants-storefront.png?w=381&amp;h=680\" alt=\"Restaurants-storefront\" width=\"381\" height=\"680\"></p><p>Amazon says that customers\u00a0will see their food delivered within an hour or less with no additional charges or\u00a0delivery fees.</p><p>That\u2019s slightly different from how\u00a0Prime Now works\u00a0today, which involves free two-hour deliveries but a $7.99 fee for one-hour deliveries. In fact, the company notes that the food delivery service\u2019s\u00a0lack of fees in general, as well as the fact that it\u2019s not marking up the prices for restaurant menu items, will be a competitive advantage.</p><p>The company also says that, for its restaurant partners, the service will allow them to tap into Amazon\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d customers \u2013 that is, those who pay $99 per year for Amazon Prime and who maintain payment information in Amazon\u2019s Wallet.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1205700\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/restaurant-selection-skillet.png?w=383&amp;h=680\" alt=\"Restaurant selection - Skillet\" width=\"383\" height=\"680\"></p><p>At launch, Prime Now is working with dozens of local restaurants on a rev-share basis, including\u00a0Cactus, Wild Ginger, Skillet, Marination Station, Re:public, Caf\u00e9 Yumm, Ten Mercer, Mamnoon and many more. But while there are no larger chains working with the company today, Amazon says that\u2019s still an option. However, the company did indicate that it has a \u201chigh bar\u201d for which restaurants it\u2019s choosing to offer through its Prime Now service, which hints that it may be trying to compete on restaurant quality over breadth.</p><p>The announcement\u00a0follows <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/04/us-amazon-com-restaurants-idUSKCN0R427320150904\">recent sightings</a>\u00a0of online job listings on LinkedIn and Amazon\u2019s own jobs site which noted that the company was seeking employees for a dedicated division called Amazon Restaurants in Seattle and New York.

Amazon declined to give a total head count, however. But the\u00a0company\u00a0today works\u00a0with delivery service providers for\u00a0Prime Now, though it doesn\u2019t specify which services.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1205702\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/wild-ginger-popular-dishes.png?w=383&amp;h=680\" alt=\"Wild Ginger popular dishes\" width=\"383\" height=\"680\"></p><p>\u201cAmazon Local did a lot of great work with restaurants, and this kind of came out of that \u2013 learning and growing from there, and seeing a great opportunity to partner with Prime Now,\u201d explains\u00a0Gus Lopez, a 17-year Amazon vet, and\u00a0GM for Amazon Restaurants, on how the food delivery service got its start.</p><p>\u201cWe learned from working with local restaurants, and one of the big things that\u2019s needed \u2013 and that we feel like we can do well \u2013 is a delivery service.\u201d</p><p>That origin story for Amazon\u2019s food delivery service sounds a lot like Groupon\u2019s To Go service, which<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/30/groupon-launches-its-own-food-delivery-business-groupon-to-go/\">\u00a0launched in Chicago starting in July</a>.

{"date": ["2012-07-05"], "text": "<p>eCommerce is going through a second revolution, and flash sales have become a big part of that story over the last two years. Sites like Gilt, Rue La La and Fab have been getting a lot of attention from both consumers and investors. Yet, while many flash sales sites focus on luxury products or fashion, NYC-based startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nomorerack.com/\">NoMoreRack</a> is finding success by trying to give consumers the things they need in everyday life at reduced prices \u2014 to enable users to afford products they couldn\u2019t otherwise. Co-founder Melina Ash tells us that the startup wants to be the Walmart of deals \u2014 with a little TJ Maxx and Target to boot.</p><p>Their goal has been to cut out the middle men and work directly with suppliers to put consumers closer to the products they buy, offering an average of 70 to 80 percent off everything from consumer electronics to clothing. </p><p>Launched initially in Vancouver, the startup has flown under the radar compared to others in the space, but in just 18 months, NoMoreRack has grown like a weed. Today, the startup has grown to a team of 30, with 4.5 million subscribers, 25 million page views per month, and is selling 8,000 items a day \u2014 and 5 items per minute.</p><p>In the first two quarters of 2012, NoMoreRack did $46 million in revenue, and Ash tells us that they\u2019re projecting to do $100 million in revenue this year. That\u2019s not bad for a startup that hasn\u2019t taken a penny in outside funding.</p><p>Of course, flash sales have taken a lot of heat over the last year for being more of a marketing gimmick than a disruptive eCommerce vertical complete with sustainable business models. There\u2019s been a lot of cutbacks, layoffs, and consolidation in flash sales, in spite of the excitement from consumers over finding exciting digital venues for their impulse purchases. </p><p>But like Fab, ask the NoMoreRack founders how they define their business, and they\u2019re quick to say they\u2019re not a flash sales site. That\u2019s not exactly true, as the site offers nine big deals per day, posting those discounted items for sale at the top of the site (along with hundreds of other items) in the morning and wrapping up every night, meaning that most deals last 24 hours. That sounds like a flash sales model, doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>However, in the last few months, the startup has expanded on its core model, offering what it calls \u201cevents.\u201d Events typically focus on one area, like household items for example, and might offer 20 to 50 related products for a longer period of time, say, three to four days, for example. This will become a larger part of the startup\u2019s business as it attempts to evolve into a true eCommerce site, not a one-trick flash sales pony. (Part of the reason that NoMoreRack had a record day on Monday, selling 20K+ items, and just north of $500K in revenue.)</p><p>Of course, ust as the road has bumpy for flash sales sites on the whole, so, too, has it been for NoMoreRack. A quick Google search is all one needs to see that, in the beginning, the site struggled with being able to juggle working directly with retailers and wholesalers, manage quality in buying overstock, while maintaining quality customer service.</p><p>There are more than a couple of complaints to be found about having orders cancelled because of damaged goods from suppliers, or customers receiving the wrong item or not being able to get a refund without making a ton of noise. These are big problems (not to mention the poor SEO), but ones that the co-founders are quick to own up to.</p><p>At the outset, NoMoreRack advertised a penny bid auction, which caused many of those customer complaints, but the startup has since moved past any penny bid controversies to greener pastures. It now offers a \u201cmake it great\u201d guarantee \u2014 full refund for those not satisfied with what they get, along with a 30-day window to return items. </p><p>Ash tells us that a good portion of the revenue they\u2019ve created, they\u2019re sinking back into customer service, knowing that their long-term viability relies not only on offering good value, but keeping their customers happy. No easy feat in the flash sales world.</p><p>Today, two stats in particular show that the company has been making progress in this regard: The co-founders tells us that 50 percent of their customers return to buy again and that 75 percent of the revenue over Q1 and Q2 came from repeat buyers.</p><p>Beyond a renewed focus on customer service, the co-founders attribute their success to focusing on a mass market, offering a broad spectrum of products, instead of going the design-driven route, like Fab. Taking a page from Zappos, NoMoreRack also focuses on fast and affordable shipping and fulfillment, offering a $2-per-item flat shipping rate.</p><p>NoMoreRack continues to tweak its model as it moves forward, with its sites set on becoming a viable online retailer in the order of the Walmarts of the world. Looking to the future, Ash sees plenty of room for growth in both apparel and household products. It\u2019s also becoming critical for eCommerce businesses to focus on mobile \u2014 a part of the NoMoreRack business that\u2019s been underdeveloped of late as the team focuses on managing scale.</p><p>But Ash tells us that the company is in the process of developing mobile apps, for iOS, Android, and the Web, which she hopes will launch in the next few months. The team also moved into new office space near Union Square into New York to be closer to the eCommerce action \u2014 a move which puts it in good company, thanks to Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s efforts to attract technology companies and startups to the Big Apple. </p><p>With renewed focus on mobile buying and customer service, NoMoreRack stands to become a bigger part of the online retail conversation \u2014 especially if it\u2019s able to maintain its 70 to 80 percent discount rate. The key is cultivating an engaged membership and not wearing customers out with emails, as so many flash sales sites tend to do. That kind of value is hard to ignore. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nomorerack.com/\">More on NoMoreRack here.</a></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/screen-shot-2012-07-05-at-4-28-01-pm.png\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/screen-shot-2012-07-05-at-4-28-01-pm.png?w=640&amp;h=394\" alt=\"\" title=\"Screen shot 2012-07-05 at 4.28.01 PM\" width=\"640\" height=\"394\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-583622\"></a></p>", "title": ["Fab.com For The Mass Market: NoMoreRack Sees $46M In 2012 Revenue With No Outside Funding"], "author": ["Rip Empson"]},

Current products in the division include Yahoo Mail, Messenger, Groups, Contacts, Calendar, covering both the mobile and desktop versions.</p><p>It\u2019s not clear whether all of Tomfoolery\u2019s other 10 or so employees are coming over to Yahoo.</p><p>Bringing more product and engineering talent into Yahoo makes sense for the company right now. As I wrote earlier today when looking at Yahoo\u2019s <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/yahoo-q4-2013-earnings-slide-6-to-1-27b-on-eps-of-0-46-beating-street-estimates/\">quarterly results</a> and declining sales, it has put a lot of investment into building out its portfolio of services, but in a business model that is predicated on advertising, Yahoo will need to continue to do more of that product development to grow its traffic.</p><p>(And if it\u2019s going to be predicated on something else, such as paid services, then those products will need to be built, too.)</p><p>There are some ties between Bonforte and Tomfoolery that point to this being an acquisition of a known quantity, so to speak.</p><p>Before leaving to start relationship and contact management startup Xobni \u2014 which was eventually <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/03/source-xobni-was-acquired-for-more-than-60-million/\">acquired by Yahoo</a> \u2014 Bonforte had been a Yahoo employee, working on search and communications products. Srivastava is the former GM of Flickr, where she oversaw the Yahoo-owned photo network during its biggest phase of growth, from 37,000 users to over 50 million. She also worked on Yahoo Mail in her time at the company. Batistoni helped to build the monetization and community aspects of Flickr.</p><p>A connection to another Tomfoolery exec appears to go even further back. One of Bonforte\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/bonforte\">past roles </a>was founder and CEO of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-drive\">i-Drive.com</a>, an early player in online storage.

Launched with the best of intentions, they<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>re an attempt to reconcile competing interests in an evolving marketplace. At first glance, PMPs appear to be a mutually beneficial arrangement for both <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> and advertisers. In practice, however, it<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>s far from a win-win situation \u2014 at least in the current market.</p><p>For marketers whose primary concern is ROI and performance, an open exchange for ad inventory is optimal. They simply seek inventory at the lowest price possible that matches their targeting criteria, ensuring that their performance metrics are met. This creates a bottom-line approach to evaluating and buying media, which\u00a0lacks the nuance of human valuation.</p><p>With this uncompromising approach, there<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>s little room for real-world considerations, such as ad environment or positive brand association. Ad impressions are marginalized to the lowest common denominator. It should come as no surprise then, that <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> are choosing to withhold their premium inventory from the open exchange. This has created a dearth of quality inventory, leading some advertisers and agencies to seek additional solutions to attract quality publisher inventory to programmatic channels.</p><p>PMPs were launched to bring the efficiency of programmatic buying to a closed marketplace where sellers could carve off more premium ad placements, offer larger ad formats and provide better creative frequency control, all the while getting clients to reserve or guarantee spend against this sequestered inventory at higher CPMs.</p><p>Currently, most PMPs or supply-side platforms\u00a0don<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>t provide a reliable way for buyers to reserve or guarantee inventory for future dates at set prices. Rather they merely provide the ability to wall off inventory and allow buyers a first look at set, negotiated rates. So advertisers are not actually guaranteeing a spend against a premium block of inventory, instead choosing to pay a pre-negotiated CPM only when a cookie-match occurs. PMPs have evolved into <span class=\"il\">marketplaces</span> where buyers get a free first-look at higher-quality inventory, with improved placements, creative frequency and targeting capabilities \u2014\u00a0all without providing <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> any guarantee of payment against that inventory.</p><p>This prevents <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> from locking in revenue commitments that they need for content production and site operations for the year. Because\u00a0<span class=\"il\">publishers</span> don<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>t have a guaranteed revenue stream, their ability to create quality content is under threat.</p><p>Why? Look to the marketplace.</p><p>For a marketplace to succeed, you not only need enough buyers and sellers to drive competition, but also an agreed-upon set of best practices to foster effective and sustained trading. That<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>s what<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>s missing from the PMP buying process. Instead, agencies and advertisers are trying to figure out how to differentiate their buying practices in order to gain an economic advantage, even if this creates inefficiency in the broader marketplace. Specifically, agencies are feigning interest in inventory in order to reserve a price, but not actually committing to reserving or buying that inventory.</p><p>Some would argue that advertisers and agencies have the upper hand and are driving the marketplace in a way that unilaterally benefits them. But if they can put themselves in this advantageous position, why wouldn\u2019t they? Others would argue that if there weren<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>t such an overabundance of inventory, then <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> would have more leverage in the negotiation. This is true. However, the crux of the problem is that the marketplace is trying to merge two distinct value propositions \u2013 audience, and brand/sponsorship buying.</p><p>Agencies and advertisers are enamored with the notion of matching buy to ROI, and using programmatic platforms to drive transactional efficiency. But the marketplace is evolving to a point where it is not practical to combine brand or sponsorship buying with programmatic. Buyer mindsets need to become more adaptive and attune to the value of buying media in well-lit environments alongside authoritative content. We can use science and automation to help, but we can<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>t allow a purely quantitative approach to dictate the process. We can<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>t lose sight of the fact that advertising is an art that is full of intangibles. Not everything can be boiled down to ones and zeros.</p><p>Currently, agencies are bifurcated, with sponsorship (the sexy, content-rich stuff) happening in silos across media-buying agencies, and audience buying happening at the trading-desk level, higher up within the holding company.</p><p>Now, there is a push to merge these two practices for the efficiency of buying everything programmatically. This is a genuine need, but for this to happen, we need a market that rewards <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> for creating great content, rich environments and market-leading solutions. We need recognition that premium inventory opportunities can<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>t be compared to\u00a0scaled audience buying. Buyers need to be trained to value both the tangible and intangible qualities of different inventory.</p><p>As an industry, we need better methods of attributing brand value to engagement. All participants need to recognize that inventory needs to be reserved at a marketable rate, so that <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> can build operational budgets. Lastly, there needs to be a consolidation of buying practice so that demand is aggregated into holistic platforms and <span class=\"il\">marketplaces</span>. Despite the temptation of breaking off inventory for one<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>s exclusive benefit, the market needs a universal platform where competition thrives and sellers can secure the highest open market rate for their inventory in an efficient manner.</p><p>I understand that this not is easy and that we will need to reevaluate our thinking, practices and solutions. And we can<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>t lay all of the work at the feet of the buy side. <span class=\"il\">Publishers</span>, both large and small, need to better quantify their value propositions and articulate the differentiation in their content, audience and offering.</p><p>That said, with the current trend of downward pressure on CPMs, consolidation seems like the only answer for independent <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> to gain some leverage. A little Darwinism might not be the worst thing for the publishing industry. As companies merge, there will be fewer, larger publishing groups in the marketplace \u2014\u00a0which means more sway with advertisers, streamlined operations, and better first-party data across content verticals. When oversupply is no longer an issue, <span class=\"il\">publishers</span> may be able to gain some (if limited) leverage in the conversation.</p><p>If the digital publishing apocalypse comes, and it might for many, this new breed of \u201cplatishers\u201d (platform/publisher hybrids) will be the ones best positioned to weather the storm.</p><p>But for the sake of independent publishing, let<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span>s hope that doesn<span lang=\"FR\">\u2019</span><span lang=\"NL\">t happen.

{"date": ["2014-10-22"], "text": "<p>The past year has been an eventful one for Chinese phone-maker Xiaomi. The company\u2019s devices are now sold in seven countries in Asia, that\u2019s a big step up from Xiaomi\u2019s inception \u2014 when it retailed in China only \u2014 and, with big plans to be global, the company is finally migrating international user data to servers outside of China, as International <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+HugoBarra/posts/9ARVCHczyvb?cfem=1\">VP Hugo Barra revealed today</a>.</p><p>This development is important for Xiaomi customers and future buyers of its phones for a couple of reasons. (While the migration will affect international users, those in China will continue to use local servers in the country.)</p><p>Firstly, hosting data outside of Chinese services will quicken Xiaomi\u2019s services, which include its iMessage-like\u00a0MIUI Cloud Messaging service and other features in its company\u2019s MIUI rom, which is basically its own, modified version of Android.</p><p>\u201cWith this migration, we are expecting to cut network request latency for users in India by up to 350ms, and users in Malaysia to experience 2-3x faster Mi Cloud photosync,\u201d Barra explained.</p><p>Xiaomi\u2019s services business is hugely important to the company. With its flagship phone retailing around $300 \u2014 its top-selling mid-range\u00a0devices are priced around $150 \u2014 margins are tight meaning that the company generates far less revenue from hardware. In addition, it brings in revenue from software services.\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/07/24/xiaomis-hugo-barra-defends-sensational-copycat-claims-says-apple-is-an-inspiration\">Barra previously told</a> The Next Web that Xiaomi is already profitable, but the company has\u00a0only ever realized revenue figures, rather than profit and loss data.</p><p>Privacy is, of course, the other important issue here.</p><p>Xiaomi got\u00a0itself into hot water this summer when it was found be\u00a0sharing a range of user information with a server in China. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002731.html\">A report</a> from security company F-Secure found that\u00a0the device\u2019s IMEI number, customer\u2019s phone number, phone contacts and text messages received were all shared but \u2014 importantly \u2014 there was no way for customers to opt out.</p><p>As with all things China and privacy-related, the revelation raised concerns that\u00a0the information could be accessible by\u00a0the Chinese government.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/08/10/xiaomi-makes-miui-cloud-messaging-service-optional-users-following-security-concerns/\">Xiaomi quickly\u00a0offered an opt out for users</a>, but moving their data overseas \u2014 MIUI services will be housed in\u00a0Amazon AWS data centers in Oregon, USA, and Singapore \u2014 is the best response to any claims of nefarious intentions.</p><p>Indeed, just this week we were reminded of data issues in China after\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/chinese-government-accused-of-staging-malicious-attack-on-apples-icloud-service/\">the government was accused</a> of staging a major attack on Apple\u2019s iCloud service with the intention of wiretapping users and accessing their data.</p><p>The migration of Xiaomi e-commerce services has already been completed, but MIUI service data\u00a0is still in the process of being transitioned over. Barra said that it should be done before the end of the year, with some elements completed sooner.</p><p>In addition, Xiaomi is aiming to provide a better quality of service in large markets like India and Brazil, the latter of which it aims to launch in soon. Since Amazon Web Services is not currently available in either market, Barra says the company will work with local providers to make sure that \u201cusers in these markets will be much closer to their data and enjoy even faster speeds by connecting to local servers.\u201d</p><p>Providing faster and more secure user data is of the utmost importance for Xiaomi\u2019s current business model and, of course, its efforts to expand its sales to other parts of the world.</p><p>\u201cOur primary goal in moving to a multi-site server architecture was to improve the performance of our services for Mi fans around the world\u2026 At the same time, it also better equips us to maintain high privacy standards and comply with local data protection regulations. This is a very high priority for Xiaomi as we expand into new markets over the next few years,\u201d Barra said.</p><p>Xiaomi\u00a0is on track to sell more than 60 million devices this year and, with aggressive global plans, CEO and co-founder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/xiaomi-sell-100-million-phones-2015-tall-task-equal-lenovo/\">Lei Jun\u00a0believes</a>\u00a0the company\u2019s sales could top 100 million in 2015.</p>", "title": ["Xiaomi Is Moving International Users\u2019 Data Out Of China Ahead Of Further Global Expansions"], "author": ["Jon Russell"]},

Ethiopian authorities <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.rsf.org/ethiopia-government-steps-up-control-of-07-06-2012,42735.html\">argue</a> that they imposed these bans because of \u201cnational security concerns\u201d and to protect the state\u2019s telecommunications monopoly.

The tech industry <em>is </em>in a bubble, and there are sufficient indicators for those\u00a0willing to open their eyes. Rearing unicorns, however,\u00a0is a distracting fascination.</p><p>Raising funding for\u00a0tech\u00a0startups has never been so easy. Some of this flood of money has been because of mutual funds and hedge funds, including Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Tiger Global Management. This is altering not only the funding landscape for\u00a0tech\u00a0startups,\u00a0but\u00a0also valuation expectations.</p><p>There are many concerns that valuations for businesses are confounding rationale. Entrepreneurs and their investors are deviating from more traditional valuation and performance metrics to more\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tech-startups-play-the-numbers-game-1433903883\">unconventional ones</a>. Another cause cited for increasing valuations is the\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/business/dealbook/protections-for-late-investors-can-inflate-start-up-valuations.html?_r=2\">trend</a>\u00a0of protections for late investors that cause valuations to inflate further. The combination of a number of these factors has put the sector into a state of artificial valuations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the companies themselves are burning through\u00a0cash like there is no tomorrow. Throwing money at marketing, overheads and, in particular, remuneration has become the accepted investment strategy for startup growth. All this does is\u00a0perpetuate the vicious cycle of raising more money and spending more money. For the amounts that some of these businesses have raised, the jury is still out on\u00a0<em>actual</em>\u00a0profitability.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies\">CB Insights</a>\u00a0publishes information on unicorns (companies with a valuation above $1 billion), which shows that access to the club has become increasingly less exclusive in the last couple of years. The chart below shows that the number of companies valued at $1 billion or above in 2014 exceeded previous years by quite some margin (47 unicorns joined the club in 2014 vs. 7 and 8 in 2012 and 2013, respectively). In addition, for the first 5 months of 2015, this trend shows no signs of abating (32 new unicorns as of June 1, 2015).</p><p>In the face of these trends, a small group of well-respected and influential individuals are voicing their concern. They are reflecting on what happened in the last dot-com bust\u00a0and\u00a0identifying fallacies in the current unsustainable modus operandi. These relatively lonely voices are\u00a0difficult to ignore. They include established successful entrepreneurs, respected VC and hedge fund investors, economists and CEOs who are riding their very own unicorns.</p><p>Mark Cuban is scathing in his personal\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-tech-bubble-worse-than-2000-mark-cuban\">blog,</a> arguing that this\u00a0tech\u00a0bubble\u00a0is worse than that of 2000,\u00a0because, he states, that unlike in 2000, this time the \u201cbubble\u00a0comes from private investors,\u201d including angel investors and crowd funders. The problem for these investors is there is no liquidity in their investments, and we\u2019re currently in a market with \u201cno valuations and no liquidity.\u201d He was one of the fortunate ones who exited his company, Broadcast.com, just before the 2000 boom,\u00a0netting $5 billion.\u00a0But\u00a0he saw others around him not so lucky then, and fears the same this time around.</p><p>A number of high-profile investors have come out and said what their peers all secretly must know. Responding to concerns raised by Bill Gurley (Benchmark) and Fred Wilson (Union Square Ventures), Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz expressed his thoughts in an\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/marc-andreessen-sounds-warning-on-start-ups-burning-cash/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1\">18-tweet tirade</a>. Andreessen agrees with Gurley and Wilson in that high cash burn in startups is the cause of spiralling valuations and underperformance; the availability of capital is hampering common sense.</p><p>As Wilson <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://avc.com/2014/09/burn-baby-burn/\">emphasizes</a>, \u201cAt some point you have to build a real business, generate real profits, sustain the company without the largess of investor\u2019s capital, and start producing value the old fashioned way.\u201d Gurley, a stalwart investor, puts the discussion into context by\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/news/2015/sxsw-video-bill-gurley-malcolm-gladwell-conversation\">saying</a>\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re in a risk\u00a0bubble \u2026 we\u2019re taking on \u2026 a level of risk that we\u2019ve never taken on before in the history of Silicon Valley startups.\u201d</p><p>The\u00a0tech\u00a0bubble\u00a0has resulted in unconventional investors, such as hedge funds,\u00a0in privately owned startups. David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital Inc. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-06/einhorn-says-bullish-on-tech-clarifies-bubble-call\">stated</a> that although he is bullish on the\u00a0tech\u00a0sector, he believes he has identified a number of momentum technology stocks that have reached prices beyond any normal sense of valuation, and\u00a0that they have shorted many of them\u00a0in what they call the\u00a0\u201cbubble\u00a0basket.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, Noble Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller, who previously warned about both the dot-com and housing bubbles,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-05-29/robert-shiller-unlike-1929-time-everything-stocks-bonds-and-housing-overvalued\">suspects</a> the recent equity valuation increases are more\u00a0because of\u00a0fear than\u00a0exuberance. Shiller believes that \u201ccompared with history, US stocks are overvalued.\u201d He says, \u201cone way to assess this is by looking at the CAPE (cyclically adjusted P/E) ratio \u2026 defined as the real stock price (using the S&amp;P Composite Stock Price Index deflated by CPI) divided by the ten-year average of real earnings per share.\u201d</p><p>Shiller says this has been a \u201cgood predictor of subsequent stock market returns, especially over the long run. The CAPE ratio has recently been around 27, which is quite high by US historical standards. The only other times it is has been that high or higher were in 1929, 2000, and 2007\u00a0\u2014 all moments before market crashes.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps the most surprising contributor to the debate on a looming tech bubble\u00a0is Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snapchat. Founded in 2011, Spiegel\u2019s company is a certified \u201cunicorn,\u201d with a valuation in excess of $15 billion. Spiegel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/snapchat-ceo-sees-bubble-blames-020920925.html?l=1\">believes</a> that years of near-zero interest rates have created an asset\u00a0bubble\u00a0that has led people to make \u201criskier investments\u201d than they otherwise would. He added that a correction was inevitable.</p><p>To shed light on how close we may be to the\u00a0tech\u00a0bubble\u00a0bursting, it is worthwhile trying to understand what determines being in a\u00a0bubble. Typically, this refers to a situation where the price of an asset exceeds by a large margin its fundamental value.</p><p>In his 1986 book\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stabilizing-Unstable-Economy-Minsky/dp/0071592997\">Stabilizing an Unstable Economy,</a> economist Hyman\u00a0Minsky\u2019s theory of financial instability attracted a great deal of attention, and gathered an increasing number of adherents following the crisis of 2008-09. Minsky identified five stages that culminate in a\u00a0bubble, as described in this\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/17/guide-financial-bubbles-personal-finance-bubble.html\">Forbes article</a>: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit taking, and panic.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.uber.com/\">Uber</a>\u00a0is an enviable company for much of what it has achieved, and the team is to be commended\u00a0for how they have grown this business, as well as\u00a0their previous successes. However, it serves as a good example to illustrate the dynamics of the\u00a0tech bubble.</p><p><strong>Displacement:</strong> <em>Investors\u2019 excitement with a new paradigm, such as advances in technology or historically low interest rates.</em>\u00a0The explosion of the \u201csharing economy\u201d has resulted in companies such as Uber, Lyft and Airbnb growing exponentially in recent years by taking advantage of this new mode of operation.</p><p><strong>Boom:</strong> <em>Prices rise slowly at first,\u00a0but\u00a0then gain momentum as more participants enter the market. Fear of missing out (FOMO) attracts even more participants. Consequently, publicity for the asset class in question increases.</em>\u00a0Reviewing investment rounds for Uber since 2010 when they completed their seed round shows\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uber/funding-rounds\">a large variety of investors</a>\u00a0wanting a piece of the action, perhaps in part due to a fear of missing out on the golden goose. The introduction of hedge funds and investment banks funding the business can also be seen, which underlines the facelift happening in this sector.</p><p><strong>Euphoria:</strong> <em>Asset prices increase exponentially; there is little rationale evident in decision making. During this phase, new valuation measures and metrics are touted to justify the unrelenting rise of asset prices.</em>\u00a0Uber\u2019s\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uber/funding-rounds\">increased valuation between funding</a>\u00a0rounds symbolizes the euphoria around the business. The chart below shows the evolution of Uber\u2019s pre-money valuation over the last number of funding rounds.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Although the pace of revenue growth at Uber is astounding (doubling approximately every 12 months at the moment),\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/uber-revenue-projection-in-2015-2014-11\">profitability is less certain</a>. Profitability margins should increase over time as recognition and saturation are achieved in newer markets,\u00a0but\u00a0it is difficult to ignore the regulatory burdens and\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fusion.net/story/118401/meet-the-lawyer-taking-on-uber-and-the-on-demand-economy/\">lawsuits the business is facing</a>,\u00a0which could steer it off course.</p><p><strong>Profit taking:</strong> <em>The few that have identified what\u2019s going on are making their profit by selling their positions. This is the right time to exit,\u00a0but\u00a0is not seen by the majority.</em>\u00a0This is the next indicator on the horizon that will underline that we are in a\u00a0tech\u00a0bubble,\u00a0and that it is about to\u00a0burst. The catalyst for profit taking could be regulatory strains or excessive cash consumption that isn\u2019t reflected by profitability gains in startups. Savvy investors will take the opportunity to exit while valuations are still high. The exits may well be too late for investors who are further behind on the FOMO curve or new types of investors who don\u2019t appreciate that the market has moved.</p><p><strong>Panic:</strong> <em>By now it\u2019s too late and asset prices collapse as rapidly as they once increased. With everyone trying to cash in realizing the situation, supply outstrips demand and many face big losses.\u00a0</em>Watch this space for the unfortunately impending examples.</p><p>The fact that we are in a\u00a0tech\u00a0bubble\u00a0is in no doubt. The fact that the\u00a0bubble\u00a0is about to\u00a0burst,\u00a0however, is not something the sector wants to wake up to.\u00a0The good times the sector is enjoying are becoming increasingly artificial. The tech startup space at the moment resembles the story of the emperor with no clothes.

Instead of charging members an annual fee of $50, similar to the fee associated with Amazon\u2019s \u201cPrime\u201d membership program, Jet says it will now drop the fee entirely.</p><p>While initially good news for price-conscious online shoppers who now will no longer have to pay to take advantage of Jet\u2019s savings, the removal of the fee will impact\u00a0Jet\u2019s business model and path to profitability.</p><p>Founder and CEO Marc Lore, who sold his e-commerce company Quidsi, including Diapers.com and other sites, to Amazon for $545 million <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/08/confirmed-amazon-spends-545-million-on-diapers-com-parent-quidsi/\">back in 2010</a>, had\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/20/jet-com-takes-on-amazon-with-the-promise-of-lower-prices/#.s2agxy:buf4\">said earlier</a> that Jet\u2019s model would work when it reached $20 billion in products per year \u2013 something it hoped to do by 2020. At that point, the founder said Jet would have 15 million paying customers, or $750 million in membership revenues.</p><p>Now that membership revenues are off the table, Jet will instead have to generate revenue on its sales \u2013 just like other e-commerce sites do. That also raises the question of when Jet \u2013 a business that\u2019s backed by $220 million in funding, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jet#/entity\">CrunchBase</a>, will now hit profitability.</p><p>According to Jet\u2019s Chief Customer Officer,\u00a0Liza Landsman, however, the timing of Jet\u2019s profitability isn\u2019t\u2019 actually being affected. Now, it\u2019s more like the site is shifting where its revenues come from, by moving from direct fees to slightly higher upfront prices.</p><p>\u201cIt will really be the same time frame [to profitability]. We\u2019ve just shifted the dynamic a little,\u201d explains\u00a0Landsman. \u201cSo $20 billion by 2020 \u2013 in a world with membership fees, we were taking the commission paid to us from retail partners on the marketplace and passing a piece of them back to our members in the form of initial discounts,\u201d she continues.</p><p>That meant Jet customers were getting a lower price out of the gate on products. That part of Jet\u2019s model is going away. Products now will be competitive and, in some categories, lower, but not as steeply discounted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re now keeping a larger portion of that commission,\u201d Landsman adds.</p><p>To help it generate revenues going forward, Jet will instead rely more heavily on its \u201cSmart Cart\u201d savings. These are the discounts that Jet offers to customers who fill their online cart with more items as they shop. Jet knows when things can be shipped together in order to save more money, and makes this transparent to the customer by highlighting those items on its site. Online shoppers\u00a0view these\u00a0items and their associated discounts via Jet\u2019s search filters and icons that identify the savings.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1185221\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/jet-smartcart-filter.png?w=680&amp;h=383\" alt=\"jet-smartcart-filter\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\"></p><p>\u201cThe response to Jet\u2019s core value proposition has been stronger than we anticipated. With the average number of units per order twice what we expected, Smart Carts have been the rule, not the exception,\u201d writes\u00a0Lore on a blog <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/@marclore/jet-for-all-e18eb8dd04e3\">post</a>. \u201cOur customers are taking every advantage of our dynamic pricing engine to place orders that can be fulfilled at a lower cost\u200a\u2014\u200aand to have those efficiencies shared with them as savings.\u201d</p><p>In practice, what these changes\u00a0mean for consumers is that instead of savings of 8%-15% using all of Jet\u2019s possible avenues, including initial discounts, Smart Cart savings, waiving returns, and more, the range will drop slightly to 4%-5% to 8%-10%. Power users will still be able to reach savings of 16%-17%, says Landsman.</p><p>The company believes in this new model\u00a0because Jet\u2019s customer base has picked up on how Smart Cart savings work more quickly than earlier expected, and they\u2019re creating bigger carts on the site, spending more money and saving more in return. And\u00a0because they\u2019re spending more, Jet believes that it won\u2019t have to lean on the membership fees after all.

And as if that isn\u2019t enough, PepperTap, which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/10/peppertap/\">landed $1.2 million in March</a>\u00a0and then <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/14/peppertap-seriesa/\">$10 million more in April</a>, is in discussions to\u00a0expand this round by an additional $20 million.</p><p>PepperTap CEO and co-founder\u00a0Navneet Singh told TechCrunch in an interview that the company didn\u2019t deliberately break this round into two, but it received strong interest from new investors while it was in the final stages of wrapping up the\u00a0$36 million Series B round. Singh added that the additional interest comes from VCs based outside of India.</p><p>Like Instacart and others, PepperTap provides groceries on-demand for customers. It works with existing stores (that provide supply) to get orders dispatched to customer within two hours, although Singh revealed that this will be halved to an hour within the next six to nine\u00a0months.

Now, it is in 17 cities across India, and has plans to be in a total of 75 by the end of March next year.\u00a0Singh said the company was processing 30-40 orders per day in January, but that figure is now at 15,000-17,000 \u2014 while\u00a0a recent weekend spike, fueled by print newspaper ads, saw demand hit\u00a040,000 orders in a single day. Singh told us that he expects GMV \u2014 the total sales volume per year \u2014 to hit $250 million by March 2016, while PepperTap\u2019s 3,000-person headcount is likely to double over that same period.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1216568\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/android_1280.png?w=680&amp;h=510\" alt=\"android_1280\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\"></p><p>Hyper growth aside, the round is particularly interesting because it is led by Snapdeal, the Indian e-commerce firm that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/18/snapdeal-alibaba-softbank-foxconn/\">recently landed $500 million from Alibaba, SoftBank and Foxconn</a>.</p><p>Is that a sign that Snapdeal is about to foray into groceries by buying PepperTap outright?</p><p>Not according to Singh, who said that the relationship is strategic and financial only at this point.

For example, regulations prevent the mark-up of goods, so PepperTap is aiming to reach significant scale and use a different business model to make money, he said. Its approach to distribution is interesting, since it splits cities into zones\u00a0and then uses a single store to service each one \u2014 thus helping its retail partners achieve scale quickly.</p><p>It also chooses its partners selectively, working with those that need to get online but don\u2019t have the resources.</p><p>\u201cWe are not an e-grocer, we are partnering and enabling these stores to compete,\u201d Singh said. \u201cStores right now face the challenge of people going online, [many] don\u2019t have the finances to create their own infrastructure\u2026 their customers will migrate online, so we\u2019re trying to help these guys compete with the bigger boys.\u201d</p><p>If PepperTap can scale to 75 cities that would give it a formidable network, but Singh isn\u2019t interested in moving into new verticals outside of the weekly shop. So, areas like fresh meat may be entered, but electronics and other more luxuriant products are not in the roadmap.</p><p>In addition to operational expenses, PepperTap plans to invest this new funding into developing its technology. Singh said Android accounts for 85 percent of orders, with iOS taking 10 percent and mobile web the remainder. When asked if he\u2019d follow <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Can-Indias-e-commerce-industry-survive-with-app-only-strategy/articleshow/48052271.cms\">the Indian trend of going app-only</a>\u00a0and removing a mobile web presence, Singh admitted that the company had considered it but didn\u2019t have any immediate plans.</p><p>PepperTap has raised three rounds of funding within six months, but\u00a0we shouldn\u2019t necessarily expect that rapid fire reloading of capital to continue.</p><p>\u201cWe have enough capital to go on, but capital raising is [a] fairly continuous [process],\u201d he said, although interest from the\u00a0\u201cright\u201d investors could trigger an additional round.</p>", "title": ["PepperTap Lands $36M To Expand Its Grocery Delivery Service To 75 Cities In India"], "author": ["Jon Russell"]},

I\u2019ve asked Vik to explain his approach below.</p><p>If you\u2019re running a startup like me, there are three key problems with the standard formulas for determining LTV and CAC:</p><p>While it\u2019s often helpful for investors to use the traditional calculations (for example, one year of growth spend divided by the following year\u2019s number of new customers) when generating comps for industry benchmarking across portfolio and publicly traded companies, these kind of generalizable formulas aren\u2019t accurate or forward-looking enough to inform internal decision making and run a business.</p><p>As a company executive, you have access to more detailed numbers, a la your CRM and accounting systems \u2014 so it\u2019s possible to build more advanced forecasting models to derive these metrics.</p><p>However, I would contend that you need rules of thumb that can be computed effortlessly. You can\u2019t improve something if you can\u2019t measure it, right? If you consistently monitor these key SaaS metrics, you can be more nimble about increasing LTV or decreasing CAC.</p><p>So, here\u2019s what I came up with that\u2019s easy to compute, doesn\u2019t depend on much closed sales data, is forwarding looking and better addresses the attribution gap. Let\u2019s go\u2026</p><p>The first thing you need is your cost per opportunity. Say you spent $10 million on sales and marketing (fully loaded\u00a0\u2014 including salaries) in the month of June, and created 2,000 opportunities that month. Your cost per opportunity for June would be $5,000. This assumes a short opportunity lag time, which is common in the SaaS world, but you also could use the prior and following months to do the calculation if your sales cycle is longer.</p><p>Next, you want to determine your \u201cexpected\u201d (as in probabilistic terms) CAC, using your opportunity win rate and average deal size, which shouldn\u2019t fluctuate much. If, historically, your win rate has been 20 percent, and your average annual contract value (ACV) is $30,000, then your ECAC would work out as follows:</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>If you divide ECAC by your average ACV, you will derive the payback period (in months) \u2014 the time it will take for you to recoup your growth spend on acquiring that customer. In this case:</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The customer pays for itself two months before it\u2019s up for renewal (assuming an annual contract), which is not bad. Related to payback, you can compute the return on investment (ROI) over a subscription period. For example:</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>And, if you know (or think) your ACV will appreciate 15 percent (so 115 percent of the first year ACV, or 1.15 in decimal form) if the customer renews for another year, then your expected ROI for two years of subscription works out as follows:</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>To compute LTV, you need to estimate how many years your typical customer will stay with you. This can take several years to find out using actual sales data, so if you don\u2019t know, then be conservative based on other companies in your space (ask your investors!).</p><p>Let\u2019s assume a three-year average lifetime \u2014 then, based on the assumptions above and on annual contracts (versus month-to-month service), you can forecast LTV as follows:</p><p>It will take more than two years to know your actual renewal increases if your renewals happen annually \u2026 and you probably won\u2019t press hard on renewal increases after just one year with your earliest customers.</p><p>You can try analyzing industry comps to determine a good target, or just be conservative and remove the appreciation assumption, which also reduces the complexity of the formula (it would become $30K * 3 [estimated customer lifetime] = $90,000).</p><p>Finally, let\u2019s put it together \u2014 divide ELTV by ECAC. Using the first ELTV value of $104,175, and dividing that by the ECAC of $25K, we get 4.167. From a company health perspective and what Andreessen Horowitz <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://a16z.com/2014/05/13/understanding-saas-valuation-primer/\">expects to see for a good SaaS business</a> (3X or more), this is very good.</p><p>Ask most SaaS executives what their CAC is and they\u2019re likely to cite a number from a previous quarter or year. But because ECAC is based on the number of opportunities generated very recently (whether closed or not yet closed), it provides guidance on your current sales pipeline.</p><p>Another great thing about this technique is that you can adjust any rate and see how it changes the figures (i.e., decrease average deal size, increase the opportunity win rate and decrease lifetime value to see what the impact of, say, lowering your pricing scheme might look like).</p><p>Of course, the attribution of opportunities to growth spend isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s much better than the outdated CAC used by most SaaS companies with which I\u2019ve worked. This approach calls it out, so you\u2019re forced to make an assumption, which is far better than the one-size-fits-all formulas we\u2019re given by the investor community.</p><p>With the methodology above, an SaaS entrepreneur can compute their key SaaS metrics at any time. More frequent, useful guidance about a business will create a competitive edge by letting you read, predict, monitor and take advantage of market dynamics faster than other startups that might be crowding your space.</p>", "title": ["The Math Behind SaaS Startup Customer Lifetime Value"], "author": ["Tomasz Tunguz"]},

This latter item is known more commonly as \u201crevenge porn,\u201d and has been the target of a number of policy changes affecting larger platforms, including Google, Bing and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-bans-revenge-porn-community-guidelines-2015-3\">Facebook</a>, to name a few.</p><p>Just days ago, in fact, Bing <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/23/microsoft-targets-revenge-porn-with-link-removal-form/\">introduced</a> a new online form that will allow users to request the removal of revenge porn links from the Bing search engine\u2019s index.

The company claims that\u00a0reason didn\u2019t come into play when the site <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/16/reddit-harassment-policy/#.s2agxy:nJiR\">updated its content policies</a>, but that seems disingenuous.</p><p>Like everyone else competing in the social space, Reddit came to understand that completely \u201cunfettered free speech,\u201d as new\u00a0CEO Steve Huffman put it, ultimately harms a community and silences others.

{"date": ["2012-11-30"], "text": "<p>Facebook can now save photos you don\u2019t publish, which effectively makes it a cloud storage locker. Today it starts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/News/542/Photo-Sync\">rolling out its Photo Sync background uploads</a> feature to all users after having\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/19/facebook-photo-sync/\">tested it</a>\u00a0on Android since August and iOS since earlier this month. It could get a lot more photos by eliminating upload friction, but it will also pull in lots of juicy photo metadata to aid its ads business.</p><p>We\u2019ve covered <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/photosync\">how the feature works</a> before but essentially you turn it on through a \u201cSync\u201d button at the bottom of your photos in your primary Facebook for iOS or Android app. It then begins auto-uploading all the photos you take to a private folder. You can then go to the Photos section from the navigation menu on the app and open the Synced section at the bottom \u2013 or the Synced From Phone section at the top of your photos section on the desktop \u2013 to select which photos to share with friends.</p><p><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/facebook-ios-photo-sync-screenshot-techcrunch1.jpeg?w=214&amp;h=300\" alt=\"facebook-ios-photo-sync-screenshot-techcrunch\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-709746\">Facebook does some smart stuff with data and battery to make Photo Sync fit nicely into your life. Facebook says that \u201cWhen you\u2019re on a cellular network like 3G or 4G, we\u2019ll sync photos at a smaller size (around 100K each),\u201d and it will sync bigger versions over Wi-Fi. In the Sync settings you can turn off cellular uploads to avoid burning your data plan, or turn it off entirely. Facebook won\u2019t sync photos when your battery is low \u2014 a nice touch. Right now you can save up to 2 gigabytes of photos for free.</p><p>Since we already knew about the functionality, the most interesting thing about today\u2019s rollout is all the data it can mine from Photo Uploads and how the feature positions Facebook going forward. Facebook wants to help you share your life. You capture more angles and perspectives of your life through your camera than you might want to share. That means it can either make you decide what to upload and what to share, or eliminate the first decision, take care of that seamlessly in the background, and only ask you to choose what to publish.</p><p>For some, the real bottleneck for sharing mobile photos was the upload process that requires boring wasted seconds staring at a progress bar. With that eliminated, people might be willing to share a dozen photos when they might have previously shared just one. That means more tags of friends to draw them back to the site, and more content for them to view in the news feed.</p><p>But on the back-end, Facebook gets to chow down on a ton of extra data. Just because you don\u2019t share them doesn\u2019t mean Facebook doesn\u2019t suck in the geo-location data from your photos that can help it refine your news feed and show you more relevant ads for nearby businesses.</p><p>While Facebook has a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/facebook-integrates-with-dropbox-to-power-file-sharing-within-facebook-groups/\">nice little partnership with Dropbox</a> to power filesharing for Groups, Photo Sync does look a lot like Dropbox Camera Upload. Facebook might not be\u00a0renowned for its security (even though it\u2019s actually very safe without big breaches to date). It has all your friends right there to share with, though, and could be a very convenient place to save your memories \u2014 something <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/dropbox-100-million/\">Dropbox wants to be</a>. Sure Dropbox wants to be a lot more, a true data fabric that connects your devices, but photos are probably people\u2019s most precious data.</p><p>Next Facebook could up the stakes by dropping the 2-gig limit and allowing download of private photos. Facebook already has a Download Your Information feature, and letting you move photos from your phone to your laptop via Photo Sync could be helpful.</p><p>I believe both Facebook and third-party apps on its platform are just beginning to unlock the value trapped within the 219 billion photos that have been uploaded to the social network. Recognition of not just faces but brands could identify what products you use. If Facebook sees you have Coca-Cola cans in a lot of your privately uploaded Photo Sync photos, maybe Pepsi would like to try its hand at winning you over with some ads. Auto-upload photos where it\u2019s raining? Maybe you\u2019d like some ads for movie theaters.</p><p>Photos were already one of Facebook\u2019s richest and most abundant resources and it\u2019s about to strike oil.</p>", "title": ["Facebook Enters Cloud Storage And Chows Down On Metadata With Rollout Of Mobile Photo Sync Background Uploads"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},

If machines and phones start having native Bitcoin support, it enables them to support infinitely small transactions off the Bitcoin protocol in exchange for whatever goods and services a person or machine wants. One popular example idea is requiring infinitesimally small payments for e-mail, which would curb spam.</p><p>\u201cFirst, you had the worldwide Internet. Then the social Internet,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cThen this is the machine payable Internet.\u201d</p><p>It also cuts the barrier to participating or developing with the Bitcoin protocol dramatically. Srinivasan said that there are maybe 1,000 developers worldwide who really know how to work with the protocol.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a tiny number of Bitcoin wizards, and an enormous number of smart developers that have no on-ramp to Bitcoin,\u201d Srinivasan said. \u201cWe need to make that onramp easier.\u201d</p><p>Today, after unveiling the first device, 21 has hired Saivann Carignan, David Harding and Will Binns, three of the top contributors to Bitcoin.org.

TechCrunch has learned, and confirmed, that the e-commerce and cloud services giant has acquired <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://2lemetry.com/\">2lemetry</a>, a startup based out of Denver that has developed an enterprise-focused platform to track\u00a0and manage IP-enabled\u00a0machines and other connected devices.</p><p>Terms of the deal, which we heard was finalized earlier this week, were not disclosed. 2lemetry, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/2lemetry\">founded in 2011</a>, had raised $9 million, including\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/2lemetry-secures-4-million-funding-160835805.html\">a $4 million round</a>\u00a0in January of this year\u00a0from investors that included Salesforce Ventures.</p><p>Reaching out to 2lemetry, our queries were forwarded to Amazon. A spokesperson confirmed the acquisition with a short statement that noted that the service will continue to operate for existing customers.</p><p>\u201cI can confirm that Amazon has acquired 2lemetry and we look forward to continuing to support 2lemetry customers,\u201d a spokesperson said. Those <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://2lemetry.com/uses-2lemetry/\">customers include</a> Honeywell, the Demeter energy\u00a0group and First Mile, an office recycling service.</p><p>Amazon declined to answer any other questions about the deal, but one guess is that this will be folded into AWS, where Amazon has made other moves into the enterprise IoT space.</p><p>Specifically, in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/17/amazon-kinesis-now-in-public-beta-for-developers-to-build-real-time-apps/\">2013</a>, the company introduced a platform called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/\">Kinesis</a>\u00a0to process and analyse high-volume data streams from any number of sources and in real time\u00a0\u2014 a move <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eweek.com/cloud/aws-moving-into-internet-of-things-business-with-kinesis-service.html\">seen by some</a> as the company\u2019s first foray into the IoT business. Integrating 2lemetry\u2019s team and technology could be one way of enhancing the functionality of that solution and configuring it specifically for machine-to-machine deployments.</p><p>Another area where 2lemetry has been developing products is in using its platform for commercial deployments such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://2lemetry.com/incoming/\">retail environments</a>\u00a0where, for example, a merchant might use a network of beacons to alert shoppers on their phones to\u00a0offers and other messages. (And interestingly, it appears to also have developed facial-recognition technology. \u201cThe 2lemetry Facial Recognition technology can trigger environment changes and \u201creal-life\u201d analytics based on the recognized age and gender of individuals,\u201d the company notes.) Physical commerce is another area where Amazon has been attempting to expand its reach, and so this could potentially be another\u00a0area where 2lemetry\u2019s technology would be useful.</p><p>More widely, Amazon has also been pushing its cred in IoT on the consumer front. It now sells home automation hardware such as smart locks and thermostats in its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/03/amazon-launches-a-home-automation-store-featuring-smart-locks-sensors-thermostats-more/\">own store</a>.

You simply write the code and define the event triggers, and it will run for you automatically when the conditions are met. This automation should save time and money because instead of running the whole stack for something that may only run infrequently, you can now run it without any resources and it runs automatically.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1083025\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/dsc06130.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680\" alt=\"Amazon Lambda\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\"></p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cheeaun.github.io/hackerweb/#/item/8602936\">a Hacker News\u00a0discussion of\u00a0the new service</a>, one programmer who has had early access to the service indicated it does take some time to get up to speed on this service, but once you do, he can see the potential here for transforming the way programmers use AWS.</p><p>Lambda will take care of managing, scaling and monitoring for you. Milliseconds after an event is triggered, it\u2019s processed through stateless cloud functions, and thousands of\u00a0these events can run in parallel (and you aren\u2019t limited in any way by resources).</p><p>As Vogels pointed out Lamda is designed to follow basic programming principles of function (business logic), data (business states) and interactions that are driven by events that interact between the business logic and data it operates on. Lambda also operates on these basic programming principles.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1083029\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/dsc06123.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=680\" alt=\"AWS Lambda slide\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\"></p><p>For now, the service only support Java Script/node, but Vogels suggested there would be additional language support down the road. Once you create your function, you need to give it context and resources associated with that. When the resource changes, it triggers your function and it automatically runs just as you would expect without any intervention.</p><p>There is a free tier for you to try it out, offering 1 million free requests per month and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month (although it depends on the amount of memory you are using too). Other pay tiers are somewhat complicated, charging you for compute time in units of 100 milliseconds and you pay for each request.</p>", "title": ["Amazon Launches Lambda, An Event-Driven Compute Service"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},

This includes\u00a0tracking scripts, cookies, images, auto-play videos and more.</p><p>Trying to beat the newcomers\u00a0to launch, ad-blocking giant AdBlock Plus<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/08/adblock-plus-browser-apps/\">\u00a0recently released an ad-blocking web browser of its own</a>. But, to be clear, this is a browser, not one of the new blockers. However, AdBlock\u00a0will introduce an ad-blocking extension following iOS 9\u2019s debut.</p><p>Meanwhile, ahead of iOS 9\u2019s release, a number of companies and indie developers have been building content blockers of their own and testing them out\u00a0with iOS 9\u2019s sizable group of\u00a0beta testers.</p><p>While many consumers will likely gravitate toward AdBlock Plus because of their familiarity with the brand\u2019s name and reputation, there will be a good handful of new apps on the horizon as well, which are also worth a look.</p><p>Here are a few we\u2019ve tried:</p><p>Like many of the content\u00a0blockers in development, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1blocker.com/\">1Blocker</a> isn\u2019t only focused on blocking ads. Instead, this app ships with 7,000 pre-installed blockers, including those affecting ads, tracking scripts and other items that run in the background on web pages, from\u00a0ad networks and analytics providers.</p><p>The company claims that using 1Blocker decreased page loading times and total data downloaded by 50 percent, which means the app can help save battery life as well as cut down on your mobile data traffic (and therefore, your cell phone monthly bill).</p><p>To use the app, you first enable 1Blocker in <em>Settings \u2013&gt; Safari \u2013&gt; Content Blockers</em> on your device. This is the same area where all content blocking extensions have to be enabled.</p><p>Afterwards, you can return to the app to customize your\u00a0configurations even further. While there\u2019s a big toggle switch to turn on or off 1Blocker using its default settings, what\u2019s nice about this app\u00a0is the\u00a0ability to personalize the content it blocks \u2013 something not all the content blockers will do out of the gate.</p><p>In 1Blocker, you can toggle on and off switches for things like blocking Facebook widgets, Twitter widgets, Share Widgets, Custom web fonts, Disqus comments, ads, trackers, cookies and more. You can even block adult sites, or specify specific URLs or cookies using rules you create.</p><p>For those who understand things on a more technical level, you can create\u00a0very narrowly targeted rules. For example, you can choose to block either first-party or third-party cookies on all domains, specific domains or only outside particular domains. And you can create URL filters using quantifying expressions (e.g. with *, ?, and +).</p><p>The app doesn\u2019t just stop there, either. It also integrates with a web editor at my.1blocker.com which allows you to work on your own customizations via your desktop or laptop computer that\u00a0you can then send to your phone. This allows for even deeper customizations and rule editing, as you\u2019re able to take advantage of\u00a0a more advanced editor to create rules and workflows that let you block content or cookies while turning off or on various resource types like documents, images, StyleSheets, fonts, SVG files, pop-ups and more.</p><p>You\u2019ll also be able to open rule packages created and saved by yourself or others from a file on your computer and then import them to your iOS device by selecting 1Blocker from the \u201cOpen In\u201d menu.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1208759\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/screen-shot-2015-09-14-at-1-26-34-pm.png?w=680&amp;h=298\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-09-14 at 1.26.34 PM\" width=\"680\" height=\"298\"></p><p>This allows you to personalize what\u2019s being blocked very specifically, explains indie developer Salavat Khanov who built the 1Blocker\u00a0app. \u201cUsing 1Blocker you could create a custom blocker to block all GIFs on Tumblr,\u201d he offers\u00a0as an example. \u201cIt lets you block any resources on the web, hide particular elements on pages \u2013 like\u00a0comments on Hacker News \u2013 or block 1st or 3rd party cookies on all or specific list of domains.\u201d</p><p>In tests, across of a number of news sites including The WSJ, Wired, Mashable, The Verge, NYT, Ars Technica, Slashdot, Vice (Motherboard), ZDNet and several others, 1Blocker saved 49.85 percent data from being loaded. At the top of the list, Business Insider (UK) saw 84.53 percent of data saved, PCGamer saw 82.78 percent saved, and iMore saw 82.28 percent data saved, to give you an idea.</p><p><strong>Best For</strong>: More technical users\u00a0who want a customized content blocking experience and want to create their own rules.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: Free version will allow one group of blockers (e.g. \u201cBlock Ads\u201d or \u201cBlock Trackers\u201d). To unlock other groups of blockers, there will be an in-app purchase of $2.99.</p><p>Another new content blocking extension, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blockr-app.com/\">Blockr</a>, has also been in testing ahead of the iOS 9 launch. Similar to 1Blocker, you are able to customize what\u2019s being blocked to some extent, though this app has far less detail to it.</p><p>Instead of being\u00a0presented with a longer list of content types to turn on or off, or creating your own advanced rules, Blockr takes a more simplified approach to customizations. On the app\u2019s main screen, you can choose only to turn on or off a handful of settings, including ads, media, tracking mechanisms and cookie policy warnings.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1208777\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/blockr1.jpg?w=680&amp;h=434\" alt=\"blockr\" width=\"680\" height=\"434\"></p><p>For more novice users, this type of interface offers some level of control over your browsing experience without becoming too technical. Each option briefly explains why you may want to enable this setting. For example, the Media Blocker setting says that by blocking media you can \u201csave on data or improve speed on slow networks,\u201d while the privacy blocker notes that this helps you avoid \u201cseveral tracking mechanisms from websites.\u201d</p><p>However, while you\u2019re able to turn\u00a0off or on\u00a0these various settings by flipping a switch, you can\u2019t drill down to specify things like which types of media to block (e.g. images vs. auto-play videos), or which ad networks to block (1Blocker offers toggles for each one supported), nor can you configure blocking for specific things like social share widgets.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1208770\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_2939.jpg?w=382&amp;h=680\" alt=\"IMG_2939\" width=\"382\" height=\"680\"></p><p>The customization in Blockr is limited to allowing you to whitelist certain websites from having their content blocked. It\u2019s not a universal whitelist, though \u2013 you have to whitelist the site on each setting.</p><p>Blockr was built\u00a0by German developers Tim Poller and Arno Appenzeller, who tell us their app\u00a0will offer more types of blockers in the future, as they plan to support the app\u00a0long-term.</p><p><strong>Best For</strong>: Those who want some level of customization in terms of toggling ads, content, or tracking script blocking on or off, but don\u2019t need to create highly customized rules.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: The app will be a paid download for $0.99 at launch. Following the promotion, the price will increase to $1.99.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crystalapp.co/\">Crystal</a> is an upcoming content blocker that\u2019s seen a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://betanews.com/2015/08/25/ad-blocker-crystal-massively-reduces-bandwidth-usage-and-page-load-times-in-ios-9/\">bit</a> of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/539636/iphone-app-developers-prepare-to-offer-you-a-web-without-ads/\">pre-launch press</a> thanks to creator Dean Murphy\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://murphyapps.co/blog/2015/8/22/crystal-benchmarks\">blog</a> which has been sharing the results of various tests of its effectiveness during beta trials.\u00a0For example, after testing Crystal against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://murphyapps.co/blog/2015/8/21/crystal-update\">10 popular websites,</a> Murphy found that pages loaded 3.9x faster on average, and used 53 percent less data.</p><p>However, unlike the above two blockers, Crystal doesn\u2019t offer any customizations.</p><p>According to Murphy, that choice is by design, he says. \u201c[Crystal is] designed to\u00a0be simple and unobtrusive,\u201d Murphy explains. \u201cYou just turn it on and all ads and tracking is blocked by default. The app is kind of just a shell, as its secondary features \u2013 auto-update and report site features \u2013 work in the background or via the Safari Action Extension menu.\u201d</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1208768\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_2937.jpg?w=382&amp;h=680\" alt=\"IMG_2937\" width=\"382\" height=\"680\"></p><p>\u201cReport site,\u201d to clarify, is a feature that will tap Crystal\u2019s own user base to help the app get better at blocking. If you come across a website that\u2019s still showing ads (or has stopped working because of the blocking, perhaps), you can submit the URL directly to the app\u2019s developer. You won\u2019t have to turn Crystal off to get around a broken site, of course \u2013 in iOS 9, you can hold down the refresh button in Safari and choose \u201creload without content blockers\u201d whenever you run into trouble with any of these extensions.</p><p>While Crystal\u2019s focus will be on offering users a sort of \u201cset-it-and-forget-it\u201d experience, Murphy says that he will introduce a whitelist feature to allow users to specify domains they don\u2019t want blocked. He notes he\u2019s also exploring a couple of other features, too, but declined to share what those are for the time being.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1208769\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_2938.jpg?w=382&amp;h=680\" alt=\"IMG_2938\" width=\"382\" height=\"680\"></p><p><strong>Best For</strong>: Novice users who just want to turn on content blocking without having to worry with the details.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: TBD, but Crystal will be a premium app.</p>", "title": ["Hands On With Three iOS 9 Content Blockers: 1Blocker, Blockr And Crystal"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

On the latter item, the company says that eBay Now was \u201calways intended\u201d as a pilot program, and while it saw encouraging results, it will instead explore other delivery\u00a0and pick-up and drop-off programs\u00a0that are relevant to its customer base of 25 million sellers, and that cover a wider variety of inventory.</p><p>Features found within the other standalone applications will be integrated into the main eBay app, however.</p><p>The writing had been on the wall for eBay Now, which was already <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/24/ebay-now-pulled-from-app-store-as-company-rethinks-its-same-day-delivery-plans/\">discontinued</a> as a standalone application last year. At the time, the company said it was rethinking its plans for same-day delivery, and the high costs associated with running such a service. The service had originally launched in San Francisco in 2012, and later expanded to other regions, including\u00a0San Jose, the Bay Area Peninsula, Manhattan, then Brooklyn and Queens, and finally Dallas and Chicago. It had the support of a number of major retailers as well, but ultimately, was a drain on eBay\u2019s bottom line. It also was competing in a busy space where large companies like Amazon and Google were testing the waters, too, amid other on-demand delivery startups like Instacart and Postmates, for example.</p><p>EBay in November\u00a0rolled eBay Now into the main website and mobile app, which the company says today \u201csignificantly reduced our dependency on a separate standalone service.\u201d However, it says today it will discontinue eBay Now in the U.S. immediately, though it will continue to pilot test scheduled deliveries, a separate offering, in the U.K. It also continues to offer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pages.ebay.com/instorepickup/\">in-store pickups</a>\u00a0in the U.S., which is supported at a number of Best Buy and Toys R Us stores, for example.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found that the types of things that people buy on eBay aren\u2019t necessarily those that are in high demand for same-day delivery, and that same-day options for the most part exclude core eBay sellers who don\u2019t have offline locations,\u201d explained an eBay spokesperson, detailing the reasons behind eBay Now\u2019s closure. \u201cWe want to enable the most relevant solutions for our customers, and offer those that are most in line with local shopping and delivery preferences around the world.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, following\u00a0its\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/20/ebay-doubles-down-on-its-valet-service-with-acquisition-of-clothing-resale-startup-twice/\">acquisition</a> of clothing resale service Twice earlier this month, eBay is also today\u00a0announcing its plans to discontinue its eBay Valet\u00a0standalone mobile application. But, in this case, this\u00a0doesn\u2019t signal the end of eBay Valet itself\u00a0\u2013 after all, expanding eBay\u2019s\u00a0\u201cSell For Me\u201d service is what the addition of Twice\u2019s tech and engineering team was all about. Instead, the company says that Valet will be integrated into the main eBay application in the future.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/17/ebay-launches-ebay-valet-an-iphone-app-that-does-the-selling-for-you/\">Launched last summer</a>, eBay Valet rolled out as a\u00a0mobile version of eBay\u2019s \u201cSell for Me\u201d online service, which was designed to make it easier for first-time sellers or anyone else who didn\u2019t want to do with the hassles of setting up and managing their own listings an alternative to selling directly on eBay\u2019s marketplace.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1017386\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/ebay-valet.jpg?w=680&amp;h=383\" alt=\"ebay-valet\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\"></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>With eBay Valet\u2019s app, customers were able to snap a photo of their items with their phone\u2019s camera then narrate a product description in order to get an estimate from a professional seller about their item\u2019s worth. They could also request a box for their items to make shipping easier, though this feature disappeared in later months.</p><p>According to an email sent out to eBay Valet users, eBay has decided to discontinue the standalone app on August 6th, and will incorporate the Valet service into the main eBay app later this year. The email\u00a0implies there could be a lapse in between when the app is shut down and the new mobile experience is live, as eBay notes that customers can use eBay Valet on the web \u201cin the meantime.\u201d</p><p>In addition, eBay says it will be shutting down other standalone mobile applications, too, including eBay Fashion and eBay Motors. The former will be shut down in the \u201ccoming weeks\u201d and the latter will be decommissioned \u201clater this year.\u201d The functionality of these apps will be integrated into eBay\u2019s core apps for iPhone, iPad and Android later this year, too.</p><p>None of eBay\u2019s standalone apps were all that popular. On iOS, for example, eBay Valet is ranked No. 1,177 in the Lifestyle category, according to App Annie\u2019s most recent rankings, while Fashion is No. 650 and Motors is No. 184.</p><p>The company says its goal with all these closures\u00a0is to make selling on eBay a simplified experience for its user base.</p><p>\u201cAs an early leader in mobile commerce we have created significant business value and insights from these special-purpose apps,\u201d the company stated in an announcement. \u201cOver the years we have integrated many of the insights, learnings, and functionality into our core mobile experiences.\u201d</p><p>But in reality, the closures are more about making sure eBay\u2019s resources are aimed at making its online marketplace successful, now that it doesn\u2019t have PayPal\u2019s revenue and growth to rely upon.</p><p>These aren\u2019t the only standalone apps eBay has killed off over the years \u2013 it has also done away with offerings like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/03/ebays-instant-sale-ios-app-allows-you-to-exchange-gadgets-for-cash-on-the-go/\">eBay Instant Sale</a>,<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/12/ebay-is-latest-to-join-3d-printing-craze-with-new-app-for-customizable-goods-ebay-exact/\"> eBay Exact</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-launches-new-deals-iphone-app-adds-social-networking-integration-to-existing-ebay-mobile-app/\">eBay Deals</a>, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/12/ebay-debuts-standlone-couch-commerce-ipad-app-to-purchase-items-seen-on-tv-watch-with-ebay/\">Watch with eBay</a> and more. In fact, few of eBay\u2019s standalone efforts have really taken off, and after these new closures, the only apps published by eBay will be eBay\u2019s core app and the barcode scanner RedLaser.</p><p>The post implies this may not be the last of eBay\u2019s announcements on the clean-up front, noting that these closures are the\u00a0\u201cfirst phase of our sunset plans.\u201d The news follows that of eBay\u2019s decision to also <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/15/ebay-enterprise-taker/\">unload its enterprise business</a>\u00a0for $900 million, and its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/19/us-ebay-craigslist-idUSKBN0OZ20E20150619\">selling of its Craigslist stake</a> back to Craigslist.</p><p>eBay says the majority of its employees working on the closed apps and service have been assigned, but a handful have been laid off.

{"date": ["2015-08-25"], "text": "<p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://meethue.com/\">Philips Hue</a> product line is great, but it\u2019s also very expensive with some starter kits costing $200. If you really want to be able to control multiple light bulbs at a time, Philips has something new for you \u2014 a $40 wireless dimming kit. In order to bring the price down, Philips had to remove a bunch of features, starting with the ability to control your lights from your phone.</p><p>Here\u2019s how it works: The new dimming kit comes with one light bulb and a new wireless switch. This switch couldn\u2019t be simpler. It has two big on and off buttons, and two buttons to adjust the brightness of your lightbulbs. It comes with a battery, and you can just stick to your wall without having to wire it or replace your existing switch. It\u2019s a great way to try smart light bulbs if you are just renting your apartment.</p><p>But this switch only makes sense if you use it with multiple lights, letting you control all the lights in your room from one switch. So you\u2019ll actually have to spend $20 for each extra Hue Lux light bulb.</p><p>Finally, the new wireless switch doesn\u2019t come with the Hue bridge, meaning that you can use it without having to plug a tiny bridge to your router. But there are a few downsides. It means that the switch only communicates with your lights \u2014 it doesn\u2019t connect to your Wi-Fi network. You won\u2019t be able to control your lights from your phone or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://chromaforhue.com\">computer</a>. You can also forget about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ifttt.com/hue\">IFTTT integration</a>.</p><p>And this switch won\u2019t let you control the color of your lights as there isn\u2019t any dedicated button to change the color \u2014 it is made for the less expensive Lux light bulbs. The only thing you can control is how bright they are, which, to be fair, is probably my main use case for my Hue installation.</p><p>What if you want to go to the next level? The company says that you will be able to connect the switch with a Hue bridge. And it will turn your existing Hue lights into full-fledged Hue lights with smartphone control, IFTTT compatibility and more.</p><p>The dimming kit competes with less expensive <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gelinkbulbs.com\">GE Link</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.belkin.com/us/F5Z0489/p/P-F5Z0489/\">Belkin WeMo</a> ecosystems.

{"date": ["2015-09-16"], "text": "<p></p><p>Startups fail. In fact, startups often fail. Anyone who has spent any time in the startup and venture capital\u00a0ecosystem will tell you that failure is the most pervasive characteristic of the ecosystem. There is no shame in that. If building a great business from a startup was easy, everyone would be an entrepreneur. If identifying a startup that would return 10x on capital was easy, everyone would be a VC.</p><p>I know a prominent VC, with multiple big hits as a founder, who had chosen the vanity plate for his first Ferrari to bear the name of his first failed startup. He told me that he learned more in that\u00a0failure\u00a0than he could have\u00a0in any big outcome. That was an \u201caha\u201d moment.</p><p>More recently, one of my startups hit the wall and shut down. In the weeks leading up to closing its doors, I\u00a0experienced many other \u201caha\u201d moments. I thought it might be helpful for me to share three of the biggest ones.</p><p>But first, let me put some very basic facts before you. The startup was the founders\u2019 first. What the founders\u2019 lacked in experience, they made up for in passion and enthusiasm. They had raised a few million dollars from a novice fund in the form of a relatively standard preferred stock financing. The investors did not have a board seat and, therefore, the founders unilaterally controlled the board without investor input.</p><p>The investors, however, did have a block on a sale of the business, unless the sale exceeded an agreed upon price. In the months preceding the company\u2019s ultimate demise, the company had raised a bridge round in the form of a convertible note. Management\u00a0sought to raise additional capital, to no avail, and\u00a0ultimately reached out to a handful of competitors to explore a potential sale. Ultimately, one potential acquirer emerged that had an interest in the company\u2019s core IP and the continuing services of the company\u2019s founders.</p><p>Unfortunately, the price they were willing to pay for the company was less than the principal amount of the convertible notes that the company\u00a0raised in its bridge financings \u2014\u00a0and far less than the thresholds that would trigger an automatic conversion of the preferred stock that would avoid the requirement that the preferred stockholders consent to the transaction.</p><p>And therein lay the quandary. To do the deal, the company needed the approval of its preferred stockholders. But the preferred stockholders had no reason to approve a deal in which all of the proceeds would go to the holders of the debt in the bridge financing, despite the fact that they had invested significantly more capital into the company, and were insistent on a pro rata distribution of the proceeds as a condition to allowing the deal to proceed.</p><p>The note holders were willing to accommodate the preferred stockholders with a small piece of the proceeds, but would not share the proceeds on a pro rata basis. As a result, a sale of the business required three disparate constituencies\u00a0\u2014 the founders, the preferred stockholders and the convertible debt holders \u2014 to come together and agree to a path forward. But that never happened, and the company hit the wall. Looking back, here are some of my \u201caha\u201d moments as to why.</p><p>Unbridled passion and unbounded enthusiasm are the hallmarks of any great founder. Unfortunately, however, it is all too easy for a founder to confuse his or her desire to will a good outcome with the reality that will inevitably out-will any founder.</p><p>In this particular instance, the founders simply did not want to believe that despite some successes, the business simply may not have been on a trajectory to attract additional capital. Moreover, they were reluctant to scale back their expenditures to create a longer pathway to the milestones that may have attracted additional capital.</p><p>Similarly, by focusing all their attention on emphasizing to their investors the successes they were achieving, and ignoring many of the other shortcomings of the business, they created an impression with the investors that did not jibe with the reality they faced. As a result, when reality took over events, the founders lost their credibility with their investors. And, unfortunately, there is nothing more important in difficult times than having earned credibility with your cap table.</p><p>Of course, I am not suggesting for any founder or entrepreneur to forego enthusiasm or passion in what he or she does day-to-day, or the way in which he or she presents the potential for the business. But I am suggesting that, especially in troubled waters, there is nothing more important than trying to present your investors with an objective view of the business and to balance your successes with your failures and the challenges that you face.</p><p>In this\u00a0case, I tend to believe that had the founders presented a more realistic picture for their investors in the lead-up to the end, the investors may have been less surprised by the stark choices they faced and, therefore, been more willing to be accommodating.</p><p>Again, there is a natural tendency by many founders to only share good news, to only share wins and to only highlight accomplishments. But it can be as important to share bad news, shortcomings and failings. The inclination to go into a shell in the face of problems or challenges creates an information vacuum that will be extremely difficult to bridge when you inevitably have to turn to your investors for help.</p><p>First of all, you never want to surprise your investors with bad news. Surprising them with good news is a different matter, but not bad news. Secondly, if you are not engaging with your investors about the problems that you are seeing in your business, then you are not only isolating yourself in not seeing the ideas and suggestions of others, but also are taking away the investors\u2019 \u201cshared ownership\u201d of the problem. If your investors feel like they share ownership in your problem, they are going to be a lot more accommodating in helping you find a path forward than if you have not been forthcoming with them, and they view the problem as your creation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the founders in the example I shared with you had stopped sharing information with their investors because they were at odds on how to execute against the plan, and had, over time, come to the conclusion that there was no real value in sharing information and plans because it typically yielded acrimony.</p><p>That was a mistake. Acrimony may be unpleasant, but\u00a0it may be necessary if you want to maintain an honest dialogue with your investors. The alternative to acrimony should never be a\u00a0failure\u00a0to communicate. Once the channels of communications are not functioning properly, it is really hard to ask your investors to take a leap of faith with you.</p><p>I am always surprised by how little time founders and entrepreneurs spend in really getting to know their investors. There are two really important elements to really knowing your investors. First and foremost, do your diligence before taking money from an investor. Remember that not all investors are good investors. Make sure to ask your investors about their bad outcomes. Do what you can to learn about deals that they had to write off, and try to connect with the management team at those companies to get a measure of their experience under those circumstances.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to be a good investor when your investment is working out. But it\u2019s really, really hard to be a good investor when your investment is not. Try to get a sense of how the investor behaved under the stress of a bad outcome. Was he or she supportive? Was he or she able to contribute in a meaningful way to trying to devise better outcomes? Was he or she rational and fair in the final analysis? Those are important questions to ask. But it is just as important to get to know your investor in your working relationship.</p><p>And that only happens if you are \u201cworking\u201d with your investor, sharing ideas and maintaining a constant dialogue. In so doing, you can get to know your investor and you can manage your relationship in a way that will enable you to get the most out of your investor. Hindsight is always 20/20,\u00a0but in the example I\u00a0shared with you, the investors proved themselves to be obstinate, unyielding and irrational. These are all very bad traits in an investor, which may have been gleaned earlier with a greater degree of diligence and caution at the outset of the relationship.</p><p>But the founders also failed to do more during the course of their relationship to come to terms with their investors\u2019 idiosyncrasies. The founders also failed to build a strong enough bridge that could offer the possibility of a path across the troubled waters that they ultimately faced.</p>", "title": ["A Case Study Of Startup Failure"], "author": ["Bo Yaghmaie"]},

{"date": ["2014-10-22"], "text": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zoho.com/\">Zoho.com</a> has been delivering online applications\u00a0since 2005. That\u2019s long before most of us were\u00a0calling\u00a0it the cloud, and today it has over 30 applications, most of which to this point have been aimed at the front office with applications such as\u00a0an office suite, email, CRM and project management. But Zoho.com wants to begin\u00a0focusing on the back office more \u2013and today it\u00a0announced a new subscription management service called Zoho Subscriptions that\u00a0is tightly integrated with its accounting package, Zoho Books.</p><p>Zoho.com differentiates itself from the pack by\u00a0offering enterprise-grade programs in the cloud for a competitive\u00a0price, and they are not shy about pointing out that, while their competitors in the cloud take millions of dollars in venture capital and bleed red ink, their company has never taken a penny of outside money. It\u2019s worth noting that Zoho.com is a division of Zoho Corporation, which also includes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.manageengine.com/\">ManageEngine</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.webnms.com/\">WebNMS</a>.</p><p>As company president Raj Sabhlok told me, they spend their money carefully and diversify\u00a0across these different services, which helps keep them\u00a0profitable. \u201cWe\u2019ve never taken any funding. [We are completely] bootstrapped. So, we\u2019ve been profitable nearly since inception, 18 years ago (when the parent company launched). The company is in many lines of business, but our guiding philosophy has been don\u2019t invest ahead of our means. See success, and then invest more incrementally. We remain a private company, and have no plans to go public or sell. In fact, we want to become one of those rare private billion dollar companies,\u201d he wrote to me in an email.</p><p>The new subscription service \u00a0the company is launching today is part of that diversity. They want to begin building applications aimed at back office management. Sabhlok says what separates Zoho Subscriptions\u00a0from the competition is the tight integration with the accounting package, creating what he calls \u201ca bridge between the subscription economy and traditional accounting.\u201d</p><p>The way it works is you enter your subscription information in Zoho Subscriptions, and it\u00a0handles the entire transaction including\u00a0invoicing, credit card information, receipt generation and capturing\u00a0the monthly revenue \u2013and it shares that revenue with Zoho Books. So say the subscription is for a\u00a0\u00a0year at $10 per month. The $10 is captured in Subscriptions, but also shows up as revenue in Zoho Books automatically in real time, so that you don\u2019t have to enter it again. Sabhlok says this shared code base is a competitive advantage over stand-alone cloud services which may integrate with other cloud services via open APIs, but don\u2019t have the built-in integration.</p><p>\u201cCompanies need to have an integration strategy. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/17/the-spirit-of-coopetition-is-alive-and-well-in-the-cloud/\">They may be able to get it through coopetition</a>, but our strategy is to provide it out-of-the-box. We build everything in-house off a common code base. We believe this strategy wins out over integrations or acquisitions,\u201d he told me. But he added that in spite of that they too offer open APIs for companies who require integration with other programs, recognizing that not everyone will use Zoho for everything.</p><p>In addition to the bookkeeping aspect of Zoho Subscription, it also provides business metrics related to subscriptions.\u00a0This allows companies based on the subscription economy to\u00a0see how well their business is performing using\u00a0common subscription metrics such as\u00a0monthly recurring revenue (MRR), average revenue per user (ARPU), life time\u00a0value (LTV), churn rate and activation count, giving subscription based businesses an accurate picture of their current performance.</p><p>To entice people to try the new service, Zoho is offering a 6 month trial\u00a0that includes both Zoho Subscriptions and Zoho Books for $49 per month for unlimited transactions. After the trial period, the two services\u00a0cost $49 per month for 50 credit card transactions, and $5 for every additional 50 credit card transactions.</p><p>Photo Credit: <!-- HTML Credit Code for Can Stock Photo--> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.canstockphoto.com\">(c) Can Stock Photo</a></p>", "title": ["Zoho\u2019s Latest Service Targets Subscription Economy"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},

Various public figures (female and male) have suffered episodes of\u00a0abuse via\u00a0the platform in recent years, such as British journalist and feminist activist Caroline Criado-Perez (following her\u00a02013 campaign to have a woman depicted on British bank notes). Or the daughter of Robin Williams, following her father\u2019s\u00a0suicide.\u00a0The sight of a public figure taking a Twitter hiatus after an abusive episode is a regular occurrence.</p><p>Just this month comedian Sue Perkins tweeted she was off Twitter for \u201ca bit\u201d after being targeted with violent death threats following\u00a0rumors she might take over as presenter of a BBC TV show about cars.</p><p>Back in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7982099/twitter-ceo-sent-memo-taking-personal-responsibility-for-the\">February</a> a leaked memo from Twitter CEO Dick Costolo to staff indicated he\u00a0was both aware of Twitter\u2019s abuse problem and intending (finally) to prioritizing tackling it.\u00a0\u201cWe suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we\u2019ve sucked at it for years.\u00a0It\u2019s no secret and the rest of the world talks about it every day. We lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day,\u201d he wrote.</p><p>To use the vernacular: <em>no shit</em>.</p><p>Today Twitter has laid out its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2015/policy-and-product-updates-aimed-at-combating-abuse\">latest strategies</a>\u00a0for dealing with abusive trolling. Some of which are\u00a0still evidently a work in progress. Indeed Twitter suggests the entire precarious business of balancing its long-stated\u00a0desire\u00a0to champion free speech with the need to avoid becoming\u00a0a dumb\u00a0conduit\u00a0for online\u00a0bullying\u00a0(and worse)\u00a0is something that\u2019s likely to result in continued tweaks in this area.</p><p>\u201cAs the ultimate goal is to ensure that Twitter is a safe place for the widest possible range of perspectives, we will continue to evaluate and update our approach in this critical arena,\u201d notes\u00a0Shreyas Doshi, Twitter\u2019s\u00a0director of product management.</p><p>One\u00a0key\u00a0change Twitter has announced today is also being described as a test, so is clearly being actively evaluated for effectiveness.\u00a0This is an actual\u00a0product change, not just a policy tweak (though it\u2019s\u00a0doing some tweaking there too).</p><p>\u201cWe have begun to test a product feature to help us identify suspected abusive Tweets and limit their reach,\u201d writes\u00a0Doshi, describing what amounts to a pre-emptive filtering of tweets \u2014\u00a0in a bid to identify and limit the spread of abusive content on the platform.</p><p>So, in other words, to cut abusive trolls off at the moment of\u00a0tweeting, rather than after targeted\u00a0abuse\u00a0has hit home and caused the intended distress. This is a pretty big step for a company that has been so bullish in pronouncing the \u2018tweets must flow\u2019 in the past.</p><p>\u201cThis feature takes into account a wide range of signals and context that frequently correlates with abuse including the age of the account itself, and the similarity of a Tweet to other content that our safety team has in the past independently determined to be abusive,\u201d adds\u00a0Doshi.</p><p>\u201cIt will not affect your ability to see content that you\u2019ve explicitly sought out, such as Tweets from accounts you follow, but instead is designed to help us limit the potential harm of abusive content. This feature does not take into account whether the content posted or followed by a user is controversial or unpopular.\u201d</p><p><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/21/twitter-filter-notifications-for-all-accounts-abuse\">The Guardian</a>\u00a0</em>reports the new (let\u2019s say beta) abuse filter as being\u00a0based on an optional quality filter available to verified Twitter users \u2014 so the \u2018tailored\u2019 notifications option highlighted below \u2014 albeit not as\u00a0strict as\u00a0the verified filter. Which,\u00a0given this anti-abuse filter is automatically on for all users, rather than just an optional\u00a0toggle,\u00a0makes sense.</p><p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-1147511 aligncenter\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-21-at-7-02-43-pm.png?w=603&amp;h=82\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-04-21 at 7.02.43 PM\" width=\"603\" height=\"82\"></p><p>Twitter\u00a0is also making\u00a0two\u00a0policy changes aimed at tightening the screw on violent threats by widening what it said was an \u201cunduly\u00a0narrow\u201d definition of threats before\u00a0\u2014 which sounds very much like it\u2019s aimed at tackling terrorist propaganda spread via Twitter.</p><p>\u201cWe are updating our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules\">violent threats policy</a> so that the prohibition is not limited to \u201cdirect, specific threats of violence against others\u201d but now extends to \u201cthreats of violence against others or promot[ing] violence against others.\u201d Our previous policy was unduly narrow and limited our ability to act on certain kinds of threatening behavior. The updated language better describes the range of prohibited content and our intention to act when users step over the line into abuse,\u201d writes\u00a0Doshi.</p><p>Twitter\u00a0is also tweaking its enforcement actions for dealing with abuse violations \u2014 adding a new option (in addition to existing ones where it can require users to delete content or verify their phone number) that gives its support team the ability to lock abusive accounts for specific periods of time. So to throttle the velocity of trolling episodes by locking abuses out of their accounts.</p><p>\u201cThis option gives us leverage in a variety of contexts, particularly where multiple users begin harassing a particular person or group of people,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0adds\u00a0Doshi.</p><p>Many people who have received\u00a0abuse via Twitter, myself included, have observed\u00a0trolling\u00a0often follows a pattern \u2014 with a sustained wave of harassment directed at the target\u00a0over a relatively compact time period, which appears to have been\u00a0redirected to Twitter from another online platform, where (presumably) the original call to troll\u00a0was posted. If Twitter can temporarily lock out accounts when one of these mass\u00a0trolling events is taking place that\u2019s a\u00a0potential way to defang and defuse a co-ordinated bullying campaign. (Although abusers could still create new accounts to restart the abuse.)</p><p>\u201cWhile dedicating more resources toward better responding to abuse reports is necessary and even critical, an equally important priority for us is identifying and limiting the incentives that enable and even encourage some users to engage in abuse,\u201d adds\u00a0Doshi.</p><p>Twitter has been doing outreach on online misogyny. Last November it\u00a0heard evidence from a team of academics\u00a0affiliated with\u00a0Lancaster University who had been researching\u00a0online misogyny and rape threats made using Twitter for a research project that started in November 2013.\u00a0The Discourses of Online Misogyny (DOOM) team was also aiming\u00a0to develop methods and tools for analyzing online hate speech, such as building up linguistic profiles of abusers and identifying community-specific lexis in order to aid automating the detection of online abuse and abusers. It looks likely that Twitter is drawing on some of that\u00a0research here.</p><p>Discussing the DOOM project\u2019s work last November, which focused specifically on Twitter data relating to the Criado-Perez abuse case, researcher Mark McGlashan, said the team had\u00a0combined\u00a0linguistic analysis with social network analysis to look at how people affiliate via\u00a0language, create communities and use discourse in a way that forms groups of trolls who deliberate join together\u00a0to abuse people online.</p><p>\u201cWhat we need to do is now build up profiles for how the kind of language they use is it community-specific language,\u201d he told TechCrunch at the time. \u201cIt does look like there\u2019s community specific languages \u2014 like misspellings of rape\u2026 [such as] \u2018raep\u2019. And they call themselves \u2018raep crew\u2019\u2026 so there\u2019s definitely in-group markers and community specific lexis\u00a0that they use.</p><p>\u201cIf there are further incidents, or if it occurs again and it occurs quite frequently, can we build up a dataset and a profile so we can automatically detect\u00a0people who are being abusive in a similar way\u2026\u00a0The methodology\u00a0I\u2019ve come up with it\u2019s now pretty much automated so if you come up with a profile to detect them automatically isn\u2019t too far off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also see a crossover between misogyny and homophobia. And misogyny and racism and antisemitism\u2026\u00a0so within this group the kind of language they\u2019re using is homophobia, racism, sexism, misogyny, that\u2019s who they are,\u201d McGlashan\u00a0added.</p><p>Another more recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.00680v1.pdf\">piece of research into antisocial behavior online</a>, coming out of Cornell and Stanford Universities, also looks promising for algorithmically defeating trolls. The research\u00a0suggests future trolling behavior that ends up being severe enough to get a user banned from an online community can be predicted in advance by analyzing just a handful (five to 10) of posts.\u00a0The researchers say their analysis was able to predict with over 80% accuracy whether a user would\u00a0be subsequently banned.</p>", "title": ["Twitter Makes Tweaks To Limit Abuse And Abusers"], "author": ["Natasha Lomas"]},
{"date": ["2014-12-02"], "text": "<p>Twitter this morning has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/2014/building-a-safer-twitter\">released</a> a new set of anti-harassment tools that make it easier for users to flag abuse on the network, as well as describe more specifically\u00a0why they\u2019re blocking or reporting a Twitter account.</p><p>Twitter had made it fairly simple to report spam, but the new tools allow users to report a variety of troubles, including impersonations, harassment, and even self-harm or suicide. In addition, users can report the harassment on behalf of other users, even if they\u2019re not the target themselves, which is a big\u00a0change.</p><p>When \u201charassment\u201d is chosen as the option in the new abuse reporting workflow, users are asked to choose \u201cwho is being affected?\u201d and can answer \u201cI am\u201d or \u201cSomeone else is.\u201d They can then choose from a menu where they\u2019re asked to describe what the abuser is doing, with options like \u201cbeing disrespectful or offensive,\u201d \u201charassing me\u201d or \u201cthreatening violence or physical harm.\u201d</p><p>The changes have been implemented in a way that makes them more mobile friendly, and require less initial information, says Twitter. The company also says that behind the scenes, it has made several improvements as well in order to respond more quickly to these abuse reports. (Likely it will move\u00a0the \u201cviolence\u201d and \u201cphysical threats\u201d reports to the front of the queue in order to act faster.)</p><p>Another new feature is the Blocked Accounts page now available from\u00a0Twitter.com\u2019s Settings menu. This shows you which accounts you\u2019ve blocked in the past, and will feature even more controls and options in the months ahead, says Twitter.</p><p>Notably, the company\u00a0has also revamped the way the blocking system operates\u2026yes, again. Before, blocked accounts could continue to tweet and respond to you but you would no longer see this activity. Now, blocked accounts will no longer be able to view your profile at all.</p><p>Before, these abusers\u2019 accounts\u00a0could see your\u00a0profile, but couldn\u2019t follow you \u2013 a following request would be met with a message that they\u2019ve been blocked. That change doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019ll have <em>no</em> way to view the abuse victim\u2019s content, as other users could still\u00a0quote or retweet it, or the abusers could simply log out. However, it makes things\u00a0a bit\u00a0more difficult for a harasser to respond in real-time to what someone is saying and continue to fuel the fire of hate on Twitter.</p><p>Twitter has changed its policies around how blocking behaves several times now, and this appears to be something of a reversion\u00a0to an older policy. So far, no policy have effectively culled Twitter\u2019s often darker side where anonymous accounts have been allowed to threaten users with violence, including rape and murder, and tweet hate speech to anyone listening. The problem comes from Twitter\u2019s policy to support anonymous accounts, identified only by an @handle and authenticated via an email. But that also means that Twitter can be used more safely by those with\u00a0authoritarian governments in power, so it\u2019s something of a trade-off.</p><p>The social network has often been viewed as being something of reactive instead of proactive when it comes to its policies around abuse and user protections, though. This most recent move comes after a number or reports of \u201cTwitter harassment,\u201d especially those involving women. These have ranged from celebs like Robin Williams\u2019 daughter Zelda <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/zelda-williams-deletes-twitter-2014-8\">who was harassed after her father died,\u00a0</a>and, of course, the nightmare that has been <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/Gamergate/\">#gamergate</a>\u00a0which has led to vicious harassment of women like feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian, indie game developer Brianna Wu, and indie developer Zoe Quinn.</p><p>Twitter says the\u00a0updates are available now for a small group of users, and in the coming weeks, it\u00a0will roll them out to everyone. It also says that users will soon see\u00a0additional user controls, further improvements to reporting and new enforcement procedures for abusive accounts, but doesn\u2019t go into detail.</p>", "title": ["Twitter Releases New Suite Of Anti-Harassment Tools, Promises Faster Response Times For Dealing With Abuse"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

Today\u00a0new CEO Steve Huffman announced a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/\">new slate of moderation policies</a> and is now holding an AMA to discuss them, which is important considering they\u2019re rather vague to begin with.</p><p>What\u2019s new is the NSFW tag, which stands for \u201cNot Safe For Work\u201d, which will now be applied to content that \u201cviolates a common sense of decency\u201d in addition to pornography as Reddit did before. To view content with this classification, users will now bed required to be logged in, must opt in to seeing the content, it will not appear in search results or public listings, and it will generate no revenue for Reddit.</p><p>Huffman also reiterated the site prohibits spam, anything illegal, sexually suggestive content featuring minors, and publishing people\u2019s private information. Most relevant to today\u2019s changes are that it continues to ban:</p><p>Huffman explains that this just reinforces Reddit\u2019s existing policy, noting \u201cThis is basically what we have right now. I\u2019d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.\u201d</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5qrwt\">On what Subreddits will be banned or hidden</a>,\u00a0Huffman says \u201c/r/rapingwomen will be banned. They are encouraging people to rape.\u00a0/r/coontown will be reclassified. The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning.\u201d The former violates Reddit\u2019s policy banning people from inciting violence, which Huffman details as including \u201cdeath threats, inciting rape\u201d. The latter will be classified as NSFW and will have its visibility restricted.</p><p>For example, regarding what will get banned Huffman says \u201cIt\u2019s ok to say, \u201cI don\u2019t like this group of people.\u201d It\u2019s not ok to say, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill this group of people.\u201d</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1184080\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/screen-shot-2015-07-16-at-1-36-04-pm.png?w=680&amp;h=301\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-16 at 1.36.04 PM\" width=\"680\" height=\"301\"></p><p>As for how these rules will be enforced, and whether individuals or whole Subreddits will be held responsible for violations, Huffman says \u201cWe won\u2019t formally change or<em>[sic]</em> policy until we have the tools to support it. Giving moderators better tools to deal with individuals is an important part of this process. Giving our employed community managers additional tools to assist the moderators is also required.\u201d</p><p>As for what falls into the category of illegal, a user asked about posting links to pirated content, or discussing ways to grow marijuana. Huffman gave those the OK, saying \u201cAt a very high level, the idea is that we will ban something if it is against the law for Reddit to host it, and I don\u2019t believe you examples qualify.\u201d</p><p>In a more light-hearted moment, a kinky BDSM enthusiast asked whether Subredddits that promote consensual harm as sexual play would be in danger.</p><p>Huffman responded (emphasis mine) \u201cI can tell you with confidence that these specific communities are not what we are referring to. Not even close.\u00a0But <strong>this is also why I prefer separation over banning. Banning is like capital punishment, and we don\u2019t want to do it except in the clearest of cases.</strong>\u201d</p><p>This a bit like what some other large online communities. For example, trying to search for a racial slur on Twitter leads it to instead show search results for \u201cbiggers\u201d, and only let users see tweets including the N-word if they click through to confirm that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for. To contrast, Facebook doesn\u2019t seem to limit the searchability of hateful terms and Groups, but suspends users who violate its terms.</p><p>Reddit\u2019s in a real pickle. If it left the most horrible content up, it would continue to facilitate hatred while seeing bad press, spooked advertisers, and disgusted users flee the site. But if it banned it all and moved away from the free speech many thought Reddit stood for, it could see an exodus of hardcore users and the unpaid moderators the run the site, plus stoke a war with the trolls.</p><p>This issue has been stewing for years, but blew up into a full-scale crisis recently. Firing Victoria Taylor, a contact at the company thatcommunity moderators trusted, incited a backlash and protest leading leading former CEO Ellen Pao to resign. Huffman was brought back to replace her, as he was one of Reddit\u2019s original founders who went on to start travel site Hipmunk.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1179183\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/reddit-sorry.png?w=680&amp;h=383\" alt=\"reddit-sorry\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\"></p><p>Now Huffman has put forward his slate. Essentially, Reddit will push to get rid of its very worst content that directly bullies\u00a0people or groups, or encourages users to harm or harass people in the real world.</p><p>Then, it will quarantine the rest of the offensive stuff. Users will have to create a Reddit account, find offensive Subreddits without the aid of the internal search engine or public listings, and then have to opt-in in order to view what\u2019s inside. Reddit won\u2019t be earning any money off this content either.</p><p>Now we\u2019ll have to see how the community reacts. Some might deem this as destroying free speech on Reddit. Huffman says \u201cthe concept of free speech is important to us, but completely unfettered free speech can cause harm to others and additionally silence others, which is what we\u2019ll continue to address.\u201d</p><p>However, Huffman counters former CEO Ellen Pao\u2019s suggestion that the changes are driven by Reddit\u2019s desire to clean up the site to court advertisers, he answers \u201cHow much of the push toward removing \u2018ugly\u2019 elements of Reddit comes from the motivation to monetize Reddit?\u201d saying \u201cZero\u201d.</p><p>If the volunteer moderators strongly disagree with the new policies, they could cripple the site by protesting, blacking out popular Subreddits as they did in response to Taylor\u2019s firing, or refuse to enforce the new policies.</p><p>The biggest problem, though, is that what \u201cviolates a common sense of decency\u201d is still very vague. Different people have completely different senses of decency. What some call discussion and legitimate opinion, some call hatespeech and bigotry.</p><p>Huffman defends this perspective saying an \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d policy for determining indecency \u201cis good enough for the Supreme Court of the United States Of America\u201d, linking to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it\">Wikipedia page</a> about the phrase used by Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart used.</p><p>Still, Reddit may need to outline a more exact description of what does and doesn\u2019t fly. Noting that r/rapingwomen will be banned is a good start. If these policies don\u2019t seem to have riled many feathers or appear a bit toothless, that\u2019s probably a good thing. Reddit could have shredded its community taking the wrong fork in the road today.</p><p><em>We\u2019ll have more info soon on how the community reacts and Huffman\u2019s responses in the AMA</em></p>", "title": ["Reddit Will Hide Indecent Content From Search And Logged-Out Users, Reiterates Harassment Ban"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},

{"date": ["2015-03-16"], "text": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yikyak.com\">Yik Yak</a> co-founders Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington took the stage today at South by Southwest, where they addressed what they described as the biggest misconceptions about their anonymous, location-based chat app.</p><p>As Yik Yak\u2019s popularity has climbed, it has also faced growing concerns and criticism \u2013 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/09/technology/popular-yik-yak-app-confers-anonymity-and-delivers-abuse.html\">a recent article in The New York Times</a> provides a good overview, with accounts of harassment and threats, and one law professor describing it as \u201cthe Wild West of anonymous social apps.\u201d</p><p>Droll and Buffington, on the other hand, said it\u2019s a misconception to think that their app is dominated by cyberbulling, or to think that Yik Yak is used by large numbers of high schoolers. They said that in reality, 95 percent of their users are college students, with \u201cvery little\u201d cyberbullying and threats.</p><p>\u201cBoth of those are not what we see on a daily basis,\u201d Droll said.</p><p>On the high school front, he said that when the team first saw Yik Yak taking off among high school students in Chicago, they decided to just block all users in the city, and they only reactivated it after building geofences around every high school. They\u2019ve now done the same for\u00a0nearly 100,000 high schools in the United States, and Droll said this is still\u00a0one of the first steps the company takes as it moves into new countries.</p><p>Asked whether kicking a big swath of users out of the app was scary, Droll answered that if you want to build\u00a0a sustainable social platform, \u201cYou can\u2019t have growth at all costs \u2014 you need to have good growth.\u201d</p><p>As for cyberbullying, Buffington pointed to steps that Yik Yak has taken to fight back, like better filters and allowing users to offer more details when reporting potential abuse. As for things like bomb threats, he said the app now detects potential threats and sends a pop-up warning to users before they can post. That might not seem to carry much weight, but Buffington said that in many cases, those the app just needs to \u201cremind someone of the implications\u201d of their actions\u201d \u2014 he recalled one bomb threat poster who, after being tracked down, said they just thought it was going to be funny.</p><p>\u201cKids are kind of stupid,\u201d Buffington said.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1132747\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/fullsizerender.jpg?w=680&amp;h=510\" alt=\"Yik Yak SXSW\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\"></p><p>When pressed on the issue, he\u00a0acknowledged that relying on human moderators to catch bad behavior is \u201cnot super scalable,\u201d which is why Yik Yak is working on natural language technology to detect more of that automatically.</p><p>How about sharing user information with law enforcement? Buffington said the company complies with laws requiring it to share that information \u201cin cases of imminent harm or threat,\u201d but it\u2019s legally prevented from sharing that data otherwise.</p><p>He also pointed repeatedly to what he said is Yik Yak\u2019s long-established, positive tone. Buffington argued that the tone doesn\u2019t just discourage the harassers and bullies, but also helps distinguish the app from other anonymous services \u2014 so Droll said it\u2019s closer to Twitter than Secret or Whisper.</p><p>\u201cWe always say we\u2019re location first, anonymity second,\u201d he added.</p><p>Elaborating on that point, Buffington said that in contrast with other apps, the main reason for Yik Yak\u2019s anonymity is that he and Droll \u201cwanted a level playing field for content.\u201d In other words, they wanted all messages have an equal chance of becoming popular, even if they weren\u2019t posted by social media celebrities.</p><p>During the audience Q&amp;A, someone also asked about Yik Yak\u2019s algorithm, specifically why messages containing the names of some competing products seem to disappear without any downvotes. Repeating <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/17/yakgate/\">the pair\u2019s comments to TechCrunch</a>, Buffington attributed that to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/17/yakgate/#tmhmdj:F9OF\">Yik Yak\u2019s spam elimination efforts</a></p><p>To be clear, the interview didn\u2019t\u00a0just focus on\u00a0the app\u2019s downsides\u00a0\u2014 far from it. Droll and Buffington also talked about the early days of the company, how they grow, and how they plan to expand.</p><p>Droll suggested that eventually, Yik Yak will need to make \u201ca number of product changes\u201d to make it a better\u00a0fit for non-college users, but he doesn\u2019t plan to open it to all users anytime soon \u2014 the current priorities are international growth and keeping up with college users after they graduate.</p><p>But by delaying support for a general audience, doesn\u2019t Yik Yak risk missing out, particularly as services like Twitter add more location-based features? Buffington countered that the college demographic is an enormously valuable one.</p><p>\u201cIn some ways, they\u2019re the tastemakers, not only of America, but also the world,\u201d he said.</p>", "title": ["Yik Yak Founders Defend Themselves Against Criticism Over Cyberbullying"], "author": ["Anthony Ha"]},

The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/\">AWS Device Farm</a>\u00a0will allow developers to upload their apps and test them on \u201cthe most commonly used mobile devices across a continually expanding fleet that includes the latest device/OS combination.\u201d Amazon says. Sadly, the company\u00a0didn\u2019t say how many devices we are actually talking about.</p><p>If this\u00a0concept sounds familiar, it may be because a number of other <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://beta.nativetap.io/\">companies</a> offer very similar services already. Google <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/28/googles-new-cloud-based-test-lab-helps-android-developers-test-their-apps-on-multiple-devices/\">announced Cloud Test Lab</a>\u00a0at its I/O developer conference a few weeks ago, for example (though it won\u2019t launch until later this summer), and Xamarin has already been offering its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://xamarin.com/test-cloud\">Test Cloud service</a> (with support for about <del>1,000</del> 1,600 devices) <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/16/xamarin-launches-test-cloud-automated-mobile-ui-testing-platform-acquires-mobile-test-company-lesspainful/\">since 2013</a>.</p><p>The new Device Farm works pretty much like all of its competitors. Developers upload their app, choose which devices they want to test it on and the service will automatically iterate through all the screens and buttons. Once that\u2019s done, the service generates a report and the developer can go ahead start debugging the app. If you need more control over the tests, Device Farm also allows you to script your own tests with the help of popular test frameworks like Appium (which Xamarin also supports), Calabash and Espresso.</p><p>\u201cFor mobile app developers, delivering high-quality apps across all of the different device and OS combinations is a major effort \u2014 it\u2019s time consuming, complicated, and expensive. And, as new devices continue to enter the market, developers are looking for an easier way to build and test across them,\u201d said Marco Argenti, Amazon\u2019s Vice President for AWS in a statement today. \u201cAWS Device Farm gives developers a very simple and cost-effective way to test the real user experience of their apps across multiple device types at scale. And, when used along with other AWS Mobile Services like Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), developers have a full platform that makes it even easier to build, deploy, test, and iterate great mobile apps.\u201d</p><p>Just like other AWS services, Device Farm will offer a free tier. In this case, you get 250 device minutes for free. After that, you will pay $0.17 per device minute or you can opt for paying a flat fee of $250 per device per month. Xamarin\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://xamarin.com/test-cloud#pricing\">pricing plans</a>, in comparison, start at $1,000 for 200 monthly device hours with no limits on how many devices you can test on.

So they\u2019re spot on in their timing.</p><p>Clearly the company was\u00a0eager to get its app live before the widespread availability of iOS 9 \u2014 which introduces\u00a0a content blocking feature to the platform\u00a0that will enable developers to more easily\u00a0create\u00a0ad blockers and other content blockers for the platform, spawning more competition for Adblock Plus. (But arguably also raising mobile users\u2019 awareness about ad-blockers as a general category \u2014 ABP dubs\u00a0the move \u201ca big step for this industry\u201d in a statement today.)</p><p>While ABP has built a successful business on the desktop, the switch to mobile computing is more of an implementation challenge. In the case of its approach with these browser apps, it\u2019s having to rely on users downloading and using a dedicated browser for ad-blocking \u2014 rather than being able to work\u00a0as an extension on the native browsers\u00a0(a route that\u2019s blocked to it for now).</p><p>APB\u2019s Android browser app has been in beta since May, and it says more than 300,000 people have downloaded it since then to kick the tyres. Having the app in the Play Store will of course enhance\u00a0its visibility and discoverability.\u00a0\u00a0(ABP has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://adblockplus.org/releases/adblock-browser-10-for-android-is-in-open-beta\">previously described</a>\u00a0its software as \u201cpractically invisible to the vast majority of mobile users\u201d\u00a0thanks to\u00a0being ejected from Google\u2019s app playground.)</p><p>It\u2019s\u00a0an interesting shift on Google\u2019s part \u2014 but likely Mountain View\u2019s hand is being forced here by Apple\u2019s own move to clear a path for iOS\u00a0users\u00a0to more easily choose what types of content they do and don\u2019t want to see by giving developers a web content blocking tool.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/07/begun-the-mobile-ad-blocking-wars-have/\">wider point here</a> is that mobile data can be costly, so sites larded with ads are\u00a0not only annoying users by slowing down page loads times, but may also actively be costing them money by gobbling up\u00a0their data allowance. Not to mention the other big issue here: hugely\u00a0invasive tracking and ad-targeting technologies that are being increasingly deployed by advertisers.</p><p>\u201c<span class=\"il\">Adblock</span> <span class=\"il\">Plus</span> is very excited and grateful to have our app, <span class=\"il\">Adblock</span> Browser for Android, available in the Google Play Store,\u201d noted\u00a0Till Faida, co-founder of <span class=\"il\">Adblock</span> <span class=\"il\">Plus, in a statement, without elaborating on exactly how that feat was achieved</span>.</p><p>ABP claims\u00a0its Android and iOS browsers offer safer, more private, faster and more efficient browsing. It also touts\u00a0reduced battery drain as an added benefit of blocking ads while browsing, along with claims of\u00a0a reduced risk of malware infection.</p><p>But what about online publishers\u2019 business models if everyone starts blocking ads? ABP notes that\u00a0its browsers let users support\u00a0websites by whitelisting them (and thus their ads). So\u00a0publishers can appeal to their users to whitelist their ads, and/or improve the quality of their ads to make them\u00a0less irritating.</p><p>Other controls offered to users of the ABP browsers include the ability to add additional filter lists, to customize\u00a0the content that\u2019s blocked, and change the default setting to block all ads \u2014 i.e. opting out of ABP\u2019s own whitelisted ads (which it calls \u2018acceptable ads\u2019).</p><p>On iOS the company\u00a0is also touting an \u201cintuitive tab functionality\u201d (vs Safari\u2019s accordion style) and easier bookmarking, as well as\u00a0claiming scrolling is smoother. Plus it\u2019s\u00a0tweaked the keyboard layout with an eye on browsing convenience, such as putting a .com button in\u00a0pride of place.</p><p>A quick roadtest of the browser on iOS appears to confirm small\u00a0speed enhancements when loading websites via the ABP browser vs standard Safari (and of course no annoying pop-ups), however the app also crashed during this test\u00a0so it looks like there are\u00a0a few teething stability issues for ABP to iron out.</p>", "title": ["Adblock Plus Finally Lands On iOS And In Google Play \u2014 As A Browser App"], "author": ["Natasha Lomas"]},
{"date": ["2015-09-12"], "text": "<p>So here\u2019s an awkward question \u2026 How many of you are reading this article without ads? Don\u2019t be shy if you are. You\u2019re definitely not alone.</p><p>You\u2019ll be getting even more ad-blocking options\u00a0with <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/09/ios-9-launch-date/\">next week\u2019s launch of iOS 9</a>, which is supposed to\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/gallery/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ios-9s-new-content-blockers/\">support content blocking extensions</a>. That could be a big step forward \u00a0for the technology, which has been a largely desktop-only phenomenon until now. Naturally, the news has prompted another round of handwringing about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/technology/personaltech/ad-blockers-and-the-nuisance-at-the-heart-of-the-modern-web.html?_r=0\">the impact that ad blocking</a> could have on the publishing business.</p><p>Even without Apple\u2019s support, ad blocking has been\u00a0on the rise. There are now 198 million global active users of ad blocking software, up 41 percent from 12 months ago, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.pagefair.com/2015/ad-blocking-report/\">a recent report by PageFair and Adobe</a>. The report also\u00a0estimates that ad blocking will cost publishers $22 billion in revenue this year.</p><p>Some caveats: PageFair isn\u2019t an objective industry observer, since its business revolves around helping publishers circumvent these blockers. Also, the impact on mobile may be reduced as more content is distributed on\u00a0apps and social networks. Lastly,\u00a0there have been arguments that\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fusion.net/story/177977/this-is-not-a-sponsored-post/\">ad blocking won\u2019t hurt publishers as badly as you might think</a>, because the ad business has always been \u201clossy,\u201d with lots of wasted money, whether you\u2019re talking about TV or print.</p><p>I\u2019ve been watching the discussion with particular interest and, yes, a little fear, since it\u2019s something that could affect TechCrunch\u2019s bottom line \u2014 and with it, my job.\u00a0So over the past couple of\u00a0weeks, I\u2019ve been asking people in the media and advertising industry for their perspective. Were they worried? And if so, how are\u00a0their going to adapt?<br><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1208337\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/global-ad-blocking-chart.jpg?w=680&amp;h=394\" alt=\"global ad blocking chart\" width=\"680\" height=\"394\"></p><p><b>The ethics of ad blocking</b></p><p>It\u2019s no surprise that advertisers and publishers who make their money from advertising aren\u2019t exactly fans of blockers. What <em>is</em> surprising\u00a0is that no one seemed to disagree\u00a0with the\u00a0argument\u00a0that online ads\u00a0have gotten out of control. Yes, they said, we\u2019ve all seen ads that are too pushy or\u00a0dramatically increase load times, and yes, they understand why people are\u00a0unhappy about\u00a0how their\u00a0data gets used to target those ads.</p><p>\u201cI think if we don\u2019t acknowledge that, we\u2019d be fools,\u201d said Scott Cunningham, senior vice president at the Interactive Advertising Bureau (a trade organization that helps establish online ad standards). \u201cSo does that mean ad blockers are good or right? Absolutely not. Do we have an accountability and responsibility to address these things? Absolutely \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot that we\u2019re doing now.\u201d</p><p>That was the viewpoint I heard again and again: Yes, there\u2019s a problem, but ad blockers are not the answer.</p><p>For example, Harry Kargman, the founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/29/kargo-profile/\">mobile ad company Kargo</a>, agreed that in many cases, online ads have created \u201ca bad consumer experience \u2014 from an annoyance perspective, a privacy perspective, a usability perspective.\u201d At the same time, he said that as the industry works to solve these problems, it also needs to convince people\u00a0that when you\u00a0use an ad blocker, \u201cThat\u2019s stealing. It\u2019s no different than ripping music. It\u2019s no different than pirating movies.\u201d</p><p>Part of this disagreement boils down to how you view the relationship between publishers and readers. On the one hand, you\u2019ve got publishers saying that there\u2019s an implicit agreement that they\u2019ll give you lots of content for free, but in exchange you have to put up with ads. By using an ad blocker, you\u2019re breaking the agreement.</p><p><span style=\"line-height:1.625;\">On the other hand, you\u2019ve got folks like Ben Williams, director of operations at AdBlock Plus, who argued, \u201cNo one ever opted in for advertising online. It came after the fact.\u201d In addition, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re younger and grew up with the Internet and without necessarily newspapers, then this deal, this implicit deal, is even further away from your mind. You certainly never opted into it.\u201d</span></p><p>AdBlock Plus, by the way, recently\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/08/adblock-plus-browser-apps/\">released its own ad-blocking browser for iOS and Android</a>.\u00a0It\u2019s also working on an extension that will block mobile ads in Safari.</p><p>But let\u2019s get a little more specific about <em>why</em>\u00a0people are rejecting online advertising. Naturally, the answer depends on who you ask.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1206221\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/adblock-plus.jpg?w=680&amp;h=527\" alt=\"adblock plus\" width=\"680\" height=\"527\"></p><p><b>Does <em>anyone</em> like advertising?</b></p><p>PageFair says it surveyed 400 people in the United States and that found the number one reason\u00a0they use ad blockers, or <em>would</em> use ad blockers, is, \u201cIf I feel my personal data is being misused to personalize the ads\u201d (though PageFair also says ad quantity was the most common complaint\u00a0among millennials).</p><p>Williams, on the other hand, said the number one reason users cite for installing\u00a0AdBlock Plus is annoyance with ads (though privacy is also a factor, and he predicted that as ad blocking moves onto mobile, \u201cit will be more about data and speed\u201d).</p><p>The distinction is\u00a0important, because different complaints have different solutions. Take <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://disconnect.me\">Disconnect</a>, which already offers mobile ad blocking software\u00a0and is working on\u00a0new tools to take advantage of iOS 9.</p><p>Since Disconnect is focused on privacy, it doesn\u2019t block all ads, just the ones that are targeted using\u00a0third-party data. Co-founder and CEO Casey Oppenheim said that if an ad only uses first-party data (i.e., data from the website you\u2019re visiting), then his software\u00a0won\u2019t interfere.</p><p>\u201cEspecially in a world where consumers don\u2019t want to pay for software, advertising becomes critically\u00a0important,\u201d Oppenheim added. \u201cSo just for us, being a blanket ad blocker is not something we\u2019re really comfortable with.\u201d</p><p>AdBlock Plus, on the other hand, has created an \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads\">acceptable ads</a>\u201d initiative where users are presented with \u201cnon-intrusive\u201d ads. These ads look\u00a0pretty different\u00a0from the ones we usually see online \u2014 for one thing, they\u2019re \u201cpreferably text only.\u201d</p><p>Williams admitted that\u00a0the company hasn\u2019t found \u201cthe perfect balance\u201d yet, but he noted that only a single-digit percentage of AdBlock Plus users have opted out of seeing those acceptable ads \u2014 he said it\u2019s \u201cproof that people will be okay with a certain type of ad.\u201d</p><p>Naturally, not everyone in the ad industry is a fan.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a valid approach,\u201d said the IAB\u2019s Cunningham. \u201cYou hear the extortion comment all the time, but I prefer to look at it as, it just honestly negatively impacts the value chain between the publisher and consumer.\u201d</p><p><strong>Who\u2019s hurting the most?</strong></p><p>The\u00a0impact of ad blockers differs from publishers to publisher, with gaming sites seeing the largest number of ad-blocked readers. It can also represent a significant amount of traffic for non-gaming\u00a0sites that cater to young, male, tech-savvy audiences, like TechCrunch.</p><p>When I asked about how much of our traffic comes from ad blockers, I was told that TechCrunch-owner AOL looked into the issue about a year ago. At the time, it found that ad blockers accounted for 20 to 24 percent\u00a0of traffic to\u00a0AOL\u00a0Tech sites, pretty much in line with other tech-related news sites.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1208340\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/pagefair-map.jpg?w=624&amp;h=603\" alt=\"pagefair map\" width=\"624\" height=\"603\"></p><p>On the other hand, a company like Spanfeller Media Group caters primarily to women through its site\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thedailymeal.com\">The Daily Meal</a>, so it\u2019s seeing less than 10 percent of its traffic coming through ad blockers.</p><p>Even in that case, CEO Jim Spanfeller said ad blocking\u00a0will become a concern if the trends continue. And while he admitted that he was \u201cpulling a number out of thin air,\u201d he predicted\u00a0he\u2019d really start to get worried once\u00a0ad blocking got up to 25 percent.</p><p>So he\u2019s not just sitting around waiting for that to happen. Spanfeller said he\u2019s already looking at potential workarounds, whether that involves hiding\u00a0content until people turn off their ad blockers (\u201cBut we\u2019ll say it nicer than that\u201d) or asking users to pay if they don\u2019t want to see ads.\u00a0He acknowledged that those tactics might anger readers \u2014 but, well, those\u00a0are readers he\u2019s not making money from anyway, so he\u2019s not sure\u00a0they provide much value.</p><p>\u201cAre people pissed when they walk into a store and they don\u2019t get a car for free?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Other publishers\u00a0are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://digiday.com/publishers/publishers-take-soft-approach-fighting-ad-blockers/\">already experimenting with different anti ad-blocking tactics</a>. And there are startups like Sourcepoint and the aformentioned PageFair helping publishers to serve ads to users, even if they\u2019ve got an ad-blocker installed. (Williams was particularly opposed to that last approach, describing it as \u201ca short-term decision, an anti-user decision.\u201d) I\u2019m told that AOL is building new tools to track ad blocking and to monetize adblocked pageviews as well.</p><p>\u201cOur recommendation right now to publishers is to start that experimentation and that dialogue with your consumers\u00a0to find out where the tolerance areas lie,\u201d Cunningham said.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a whole matrix of different options that publishers can do in between these two things [doing nothing and completely hiding\u00a0content from ad-blocked users] to get consumers to engage.\u201d</p><p><strong>Reasons to be\u00a0hopeful</strong></p><p>Cunningham said\u00a0the IAB is also working to make ads better for\u00a0consumers \u2014 he pointed to\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iab.net/html5\">the organization\u2019s guidelines around HTML5 advertising</a>, which he described as \u201cthe beginning of a path\u201d to a better user experience.</p><p>Kargman and Spanfeller suggested\u00a0other ways the industry could improve. For his part, Kargman put much of the blame on advertisers\u2019 new obsession with whether an ad actually gets seen. Seems like a valid concern, right? Well, Kargman suggested that as advertisers pushed for improved\u00a0viewability, they ended up with ads that got\u00a0flashier and intrusive.</p><p>So in his view, the industry needs to find better ways (in his parlance, better currency) to evaluate ad effectiveness.</p><p>\u201cIn advertising, because the market is shifting so rapidly, we\u2019re using almost outdated currency,\u201d he said. \u201cThat currency really should reflect the\u00a0quality of the environment the ad runs in, how brand safe it is, the\u00a0quality of\u00a0the content on the page, how well the ad is integrated onto the page and, obviously, how much the consumer engages with the ad.\u201d</p><p>Spanfeller, on the other hand, pointed to the proliferation of programmatic ad tech and third-party data. When every ad is supposed to be targeted algorithmically, drawing on different types of user data,\u00a0you end up with \u201c60 or 70 cookies on every page.\u201d Much of that data, he argued, isn\u2019t really making the ads more effective, so perhaps it\u2019s time to cut back.</p><p><strong>A change is gonna come</strong></p><p>Will any of these improvements\u00a0happen? Maybe not, but at least people are making the right gestures. And regardless of how you feel about ad blockers, there\u2019s no denying that they\u2019ve changed the conversation.</p><p></p><p>\u201cOf course, I wouldn\u2019t\u00a0pin the blame on ad blocking,\u00a0I would put it on the fact that there are bad ads out there,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not such a slow process. \u2026 It probably won\u2019t happen overnight, but we can already start to make very positive changes now.\u201d</p><p>Hey, if things <em>do</em> get better, consider turning off that ad blocker, okay? Otherwise I might have to start looking for a real job.</p>", "title": ["What We Talk About When We Talk About Ad Blocking"], "author": ["Anthony Ha"]},

But in order to buy the output of the devices, non-geeky consumers are often still shopping sites like\u00a0like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shapeways.com/\">Shapeways</a> or Etsy, or maker marketplaces like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.custommade.com/search/?q=3d+printed&amp;cmt=\">Custommade</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/05/custom-goods-marketplace-makeably-raises-650k-from-great-oaks-500-startups-others-shifts-focus-to-remixes/\">Makeably</a>, or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mixeelabs.com/apps\">recently launched Mixee Labs</a>, for example.</p><p>Shapeways, which raised <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/23/3d-printing-company-shapeways-raises-30-million-c-round-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/\">$30 million in Series C funding</a> this April, has been especially instrumental in making 3D printed goods accessible to more of a mainstream user base. Even if you\u2019re not interested in the still somewhat complicated process of designing original products, the site lets users shop a variety of print-on-demand goods, or even turn their own ideas into products using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shapeways.com/creator?li=nav\">one of many ready-made apps</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/12/ebay-is-latest-to-join-3d-printing-craze-with-new-app-for-customizable-goods-ebay-exact/ebayexact/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-845665\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-845665\" alt=\"EbayExact\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/ebayexact.jpg?w=680&amp;h=517\"></a></p><p>Meanwhile, though eBay sellers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=3d+printed&amp;_osacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2045573.m570.l1313.TR2.TRC1.A0.X%223d+printed%22.TRS0&amp;_nkw=%223d+printed%22&amp;_sacat=0\">have offered</a> a variety of 3D printed items for purchase on the site, there wasn\u2019t an easy way to browse those items or figure out which ones could be further customized.

After eBay receives the package, you\u2019ll receive a payment deposited into your PayPal account. Today, eBay is launching a iOS app for Instant Sale, which allows you to exchange gadgets for cash on the go. </p><p>Similar to the Instant Sale web platform, the iPhone app serves as a tool for consumers to sell or recycle old electronics.

That is, it takes every step of the selling process \u2014 from determining an item\u2019s value to listing it online to\u00a0shipping it when sold\u00a0\u2014 and handles it for you.</p><p>Like its web-based counterpart, eBay\u00a0Valet is designed to make online selling easier and more approachable, not only for first-time sellers, but for anyone who doesn\u2019t have time to handle a listing for themselves. (It\u2019s sort of like the digital counterpart to those stores that would \u201csell it on eBay\u201d for you, which you might remember from the movie \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_40-Year-Old_Virgin\">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>!\u201d)</p><p>To some extent, eBay\u2019s Sell For Me service is its own take on the various\u00a0online consignment shops that have sprung up lately, like Poshmark, The Real Real, ThredUp, Threadflip, Twice and others. But unlike those services, neither eBay\u2019s Sell It For Me, and now Valet on mobile, support selling clothing.</p><p><img class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-1017383\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-2-47-48-pm.png?w=680&amp;h=381\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-06-17 at 2.47.48 PM\" width=\"680\" height=\"381\"></p><p>Instead, on its Sell For Me website, eBay <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sellforme.ebay.com/home?_trksid=p2059161.l5350\">has been promoting</a> how it can sell a number of other items for you, including electronics, collectibles, shoes, handbags, sporting goods, musical instruments and even automotive parts. However, it won\u2019t work with just anything, such as bulky items heavier than 25 pounds, those in poor condition worth less than $40, media like DVDs and CDS, high-end valuables, and more.</p><p>The new mobile app will have similar restrictions, we\u2019re told.</p><p>The app\u00a0was designed and developed by the IIC (Israel Innovation Center), a unit within the Innovation and New Ventures organization based in Tel-Aviv, which is chartered with rapid prototyping for eBay Inc. For now, the e-commerce giant\u00a0says eBay Valet is a \u201cpilot\u201d program, and it doesn\u2019t have specific metrics in mind that it will have to hit to move forward.</p><p>For consumers, the process of using eBay Valet is easy. To get started, you just take a picture of the item in question, then enter (or speak) your item\u2019s description. Within 30 minutes, your \u201cvalet\u201d will respond with a valuation range, and you\u2019ll be asked if you still want to sell it. If you have a box handy, eBay will send you a shipping label. If not, the company can send you a free, prepaid box instead.</p><p><img class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-1017385\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-17-at-2-51-15-pm.png?w=680&amp;h=207\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-06-17 at 2.51.15 PM\" width=\"680\" height=\"207\"></p><p>You can then log into eBay.com to watch the sale, which takes place under the valet\u2019s account. After the item sells \u2014 typically via a seven-day listing \u2014 you keep 70 percent of the profits, which are deposited to your PayPal\u00a0account.</p><p>\u201cEven though you\u2019re not selling the item, there\u2019s still an experience of selling,\u201d Steve Yankovich, eBay\u2019s vice president of Innovation and New Ventures says. \u201cYou get to experience the listing but do none of the work.\u201d</p><p>Plus, he explains, the difference between the eBay Valet app and other selling programs is that on the\u00a0business side, eBay is actually vetting the items. \u201cWe have a person looking at the item,\u00a0doing research on eBay for condition and\u00a0our marketplace has good inventory,\u201d he notes.</p><p>eBay Valet is something that\u2019s reminiscent of some others startups we came across in recent months.

{"date": ["2015-08-25"], "text": "<p></p><p>In the last few years, there\u2019s been a massive decoupling between private and public markets. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/08/06/venture-capitalists-might-heed-chilly-reception-for-sunrun-on-deck-capital/\">A Goldman Sachs report</a> shows that since December, five of the seven most recent IPOs\u00a0for <span class=\"il\">billion</span>\u2013<span class=\"il\">dollar</span> startups came in at <span class=\"il\">valuations</span> equal to or below their pre-IPO\u00a0<span class=\"il\">valuations</span>.</p><p>One of the most concerning bi-products of this decoupling is the migration away from focusing on underlying business <span class=\"il\">metrics </span><span class=\"il\">toward</span> total and utter valuation optimization.</p><p>Let\u2019s take Slack for example. No one would argue that their pivot didn\u2019<span class=\"il\">t</span> work or that it\u2019s not a fantastic product with lighting fast adoption (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://openviewpartners.com/\">OpenView</a> is an avid user). But, <span class=\"il\">you</span>\u2019ve got to be a little skeptical any time an SaaS company is valued at 100x, even with an amazing product and opportunity.</p><p>Consider the following: At last check-in, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/slack-expects-30-million-revenue-2015-7\">data suggests that Slack has a $25 million run rate</a>. Assume the company were to grow 100 percent for each of the next three years. At the end of three years, Slack would be a $200 million company. They\u2019d surely be able to go public.</p><p>Now, apply the most aggressive SaaS multiples afforded to companies like Workday and ServiceNow (between 13 and 17x); Slack\u2019s public market valuation would stand anywhere between $2.6 and $3.4 <span class=\"il\">billion</span>.</p><p>Embedded in my very simple analysis are a couple of major assumptions that may or may not hold true. For starters, my simulation assumes that Slack doesn\u2019<span class=\"il\">t</span> raise any more money (which, if it does, would mean more dilution for all shareholders).</p><p>Secondly, it expects that current market multiples persist. And lastly, and most importantly, my calculations presume that Slack goes from $100 to $200 million in just one year.</p><p>By any measure, this scenario would be a total outlier, yet the last two investors would presumably see no return over a period of several years.</p><p>And this all assumes that the company would be able to maintain its best-in-class economics, which is a big assumption \u2014 scaling is very hard.</p><p>It\u2019s pretty clear that we\u2019re currently in the frothiest funding environment since the late 90s. And all the cheap capital floating around has made it easier than ever for startups to raise funding \u2014 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/private-ipo-tech/\">in just the first 100 days of 2015, we saw 16 newly anointed unicorns</a>.</p><p><span class=\"il\">Don</span>\u2018<span class=\"il\">t</span> get me wrong; cheap money is great for entrepreneurs looking to scale their companies. But the reality is that along with the money comes a huge responsibility to investors and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/23/dear-unicorn-exit-please/\">employees</a> alike to build large and enduring businesses. Someone actually has to be held responsible for the massive <span class=\"il\">valuations</span> we read about on a near daily basis.</p><p>My good friend, Eric Paley, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/30/wasting-time-with-the-joneses/\">hit the nail on the head</a> when he said, \u201cRaising a big round because your competitor just did, essentially keeping up with the Startup Joneses, is an all-too-common waste of time that can cripple your company.\u201d This phenomenon of constantly raising money\u00a0is distracting startup founders from the <span class=\"il\">metrics</span> that really <span class=\"il\">matter</span>.</p><p>The unfortunate downside of today\u2019s environment is that many of the companies raising huge amounts of capital do so well before they\u2019ve hit key operational milestones. And relatively free capital means companies aren\u2019<span class=\"il\">t</span> forced to make the hard decisions required to build sustainable businesses.</p><p>Qualtrics\u2019 Ryan Smith put it best when he said, \u201dCongratulating me for raising venture capital is like congratulating someone for taking out a mortgage.\u201d Rather than talking endlessly about sky-high <span class=\"il\">valuations</span>, we <span class=\"il\">should</span> refocus the conversation on the <span class=\"il\">metrics</span> and milestones that actually determine the value and potential of a startup.</p><p>Early in a company\u2019s development, they have the tendency to successfully hire one productive sales rep, a few mediocre reps and a few under-performers. It\u2019s very hard to constantly push your sales team to perform and hit their quota on a quarterly basis, yet sales expense can be one of the largest components of operating costs.</p><p>When companies grow quickly and are flush with cash, management teams are rarely forced to make the hard decisions around people and process. In fact, many VCs push them to hire faster. I recently heard a story about one VC pushing a company to drive their burn up from $1 million a month to $2.<span class=\"il\">5</span> million.</p><p>Unfortunately, an inefficient sales force will always come back to bite <span class=\"il\">you</span> in the butt. We typically think of 60 percent as the benchmark for a healthy performing sales organization. Anything less and <span class=\"il\">you</span> <span class=\"il\">don</span>\u2019<span class=\"il\">t</span> have a repeatable model.</p><p>This topic has been written about <em>ad nauseam</em> and was initially conceived by our good friends over at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bvp.com/sites/default/files/cac_ratio_-_one_number_to_manag__your_saas_sm_spend_-_october_2008.pdf\">Bessemer</a>. The key here is a simple notion that <span class=\"il\">you</span> shouldn\u2019<span class=\"il\">t</span> spend more to acquire a customer than they are worth in their first year. Effectively, <span class=\"il\">you</span> are trying to measure product market fit.</p><p>Too often, we see companies acquiring logos for marketing purposes with the hopes of turning those flashy logos into profitable customers. That almost never happens.</p><p>We will get to net customer retention in a second, but without maintaining at least 85 percent logo retention, <span class=\"il\">you</span> run the risk of a leaky bucket; effectively every <span class=\"il\">dollar</span> <span class=\"il\">you</span> pour into the top of the bucket comes out the other end. And as <span class=\"il\">you</span> scale, and the size of that bucket increases, the leak grows even more problematic.</p><p>Think about the difference between churning a few hundred thousand dollars per quarter versus a few million. Any slight negative change to that 85 percent retention rate coupled with a high burn can have a catastrophic impact on your company.</p><p>This metric might be the most important over all others. It\u2019s the basic notion of the dogs eating the dog food. If <span class=\"il\">you</span>\u2019re unable to sell more product to your existing customers to offset churn, <span class=\"il\">you</span>\u2019ve got a problem.</p><p>Ideally, after the first year, <span class=\"il\">you</span> <span class=\"il\">should</span> have negative churn (net retention = 100 percent) and ideally it <span class=\"il\">should</span> be 120+ percent. This is important because when the market turns, and it will, companies without negative churn will be turned into the proverbial emperor with no clothes.</p><p>If <span class=\"il\">you</span>\u2019re unable to ramp a sales rep within one quarter, there\u2019s one of three things going on, all of which could be hugely problematic in the long run:</p><p>At the end of the day, it doesn\u2019<span class=\"il\">t</span> <span class=\"il\">matter</span> how much money <span class=\"il\">you</span>\u2019ve raised or what animal analogy <span class=\"il\">you</span> use to signify your company\u2019s worth. The goal of every entrepreneur and VC for that <span class=\"il\">matter</span> <span class=\"il\">should</span> be to build sustainable and scalable businesses. The only way to do that is to focus on the <span class=\"il\">metrics</span> that truly <span class=\"il\">matter</span>.</p><p>The companies that nail many, if not all, of the above criteria will be the ones that make it to the finish line, and the balance will be wandering through the forest looking for someone to feed them.</p>", "title": ["Why Billion-Dollar Valuations Don\u2019t Matter"], "author": ["Adam Marcus"]},

To think there is no hope to generate startup ecosystems without <span class=\"il\">Silicon</span> <span class=\"il\">Valley</span>\u2019s capital is to play to the strengths of the latter, but <span class=\"il\">not</span> necessarily our own. It is certainly <span class=\"il\">not</span> about replicating <span class=\"il\">Silicon</span> <span class=\"il\">Valley,</span> but rather about establishing our own differentiated communities that can strive on local flavors.</p><p>If anything, we should wonder why there isn\u2019t more capital being deployed into VC locally, or even regionally, while the wealthiest from <span class=\"il\">Mexico</span>, Colombia and Venezuela add <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.elconfidencial.com/vivienda/2015-06-19/mexicanos-venezolanos-colombianos-los-ricos-latinos-detras-del-ladrillo-en-espana_886478/\">up to 80 percent of the recent foreign investment in real estate in Madrid, Spain</a>.

According to data provided by LAVCA and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/venture-capital-2014\">CBInsights,</a> this is, simply put, 51 times bigger than all of Latin America\u2019s investments \u2014\u00a0combined ($525 million across 186 deals).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Among the leading countries in the region, Brazil attracted one-third of this capital and represented nearly half of the early stage deals. As for <span class=\"il\">Mexico</span>, the PE/VC managers deployed 1.31 billion during 2014, but only $38 million was invested in startups across 54 deals, which means that a country of 120 million people and a GDP of $1.2 trillion has a similar VC activity for startups to\u00a0Nebraska ($37.8 million in 9 deals \u2014 $115 billion GSP and 1.8 million people) or Kansas ($42.3 million in 7 deals).</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The ugly truth is that there is still work to be done to generate a startup community that is sustainable and can prove interesting to\u00a0many in the affluent Mexican community who should be LPs in VC funds or angel investors \u2014\u00a0or even attract more traditional corporates to have a more active funding role. A dynamic ecosystem requires that successful entrepreneurs generate enough capital and influence to increase the volume and size of investments.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.endeavor.org/research/endeavor-mexico-releases-multiplier-effect-map/\">According to Endeavor</a>, out of different possible connections among entrepreneurs in <span class=\"il\">Mexico</span> City, such as mentorships, investments, inspiration, previous employment or founding team, only 14 percent of these interactions account for investments. To really be able to have an exponential growth in the ecosystem, it is imperative that we lower the cost and friction of what it takes to become an investor in the sector.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As means of comparison, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.endeavor.org/in-the-news/video-multiplier-effect/\">the same study conducted by Endeavor in Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina, shows that more than 90 percent of the startups created between 2000 and 2010 are somehow connected; 21 percent of total influence connections are business investments. MercadoLibre, \u00a0Officenet, Globant, Patagon, Fnbox and Digital Ventures are among the top Argentinian companies that have invested in other startups from Argentina, particularly through their founders as angels or newly created investment vehicles.</p><p>After all, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/01/the-next-great-startup-will-be-a-unicornio\">we might need <span class=\"il\">Silicon</span> <span class=\"il\">Valley</span> to create our next unicorn</a>: I argue it is <span class=\"il\">not</span> its capital, but rather the belief and conviction that has united for decades the elements to foster an ecosystem with the capacity to change the world once and over again.

{"date": ["2014-10-24"], "text": "<p>Until recently, if you wanted to install an application from Amazon\u2019s own Appstore onto your Android device, you would have to install <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get/android\">the Amazon Appstore app</a> separately. And this is a bit of a hassle, since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get/android\">you can\u2019t exactly just download the app</a> from Google Play. But last month, Amazon quietly rolled out a new feature within its main Amazon application on Android which now includes a fully-functional Appstore that\u2019s accessible directly through the Amazon app\u2019s \u201cShop by Department\u201d section.</p><p>There, right at the top of the list of Departments, is a new category called \u201cApps &amp; Games.\u201d And this isn\u2019t just a list of apps that Amazon has for sale elsewhere in its Appstore app \u2013 it\u2019s actually a complete app store in and of itself, tucked away right within the main Amazon application.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1074839\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/screenshot_2014-10-21-15-24-49.png?w=382&amp;h=680\" alt=\"Screenshot_2014-10-21-15-24-49\" width=\"382\" height=\"680\"></p><p>According to an Amazon spokesperson, this section launched on September 9th, and we were pointed to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1965195\">press release</a> for reference purposes. \u201cOur customers want to go to one place to find all selection, whether it\u2019s physical or digital, so we now offer the ability for customers to purchase videos, songs, audiobooks, apps and games from within the Amazon app,\u201d the spokesperson explained.</p><p>However, the press release in question doesn\u2019t really detail the part about Amazon\u2019s app now selling apps and games directly \u2013 instead, it\u2019s focused on an update to the Amazon App for Android, which now enables purchases of digital goods.</p><p>Mainly, the release\u00a0refers to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/09/amazon-brings-prime-instant-video-to-all-android-phones-in-us-uk-and-germany/\">Prime Instant Video selections coming to the Amazon App</a>. But to make this work, customers are still required to download the Prime Instant Video player app from Amazon\u2019s standalone Appstore. Additionally, said Amazon at the time, the updated app includes access to other digital purchases like movies to rent or buy, 30+ million songs, and tons of Kindle books and audiobooks. The new app also allows for free photo backup with Amazon Cloud Drive.</p><p>Left out was any mention of apps and games now being sold directly through the main Amazon application.</p><p>The move effectively turns Amazon\u2019s flagship application \u2013 an app that has somewhere between 50 million and 100 million installs, according to Google Play\u2019s data for the smartphone version \u2013 into an app store app that directly competes with Google Play, while also being sold on Google Play. (No wonder Amazon was trying to keep this quiet.)</p><p>But before you get <em>too</em> excited, be aware that Amazon\u2019s \u201cApps &amp; Games\u201d section still requires users to uncheck the Security setting that prevents the installation of apps from unknown sources (i.e., anywhere that\u2019s not Google Play.) This is the same requirement that\u2019s in place for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get/android\">installing Amazon\u2019s standalone Appstore app</a>, but the process for making the change in the newly updated Amazon Android app is quite seamless.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In the Apps &amp; Games section, which is laid out like any other mobile app store with big featured listings at the top, various promotions, top free and grossing apps, recommendations, and more, you can tap on an app listing to be taken to the app\u2019s page. From here, you\u2019ll see a standard listing with screenshots, a video (if provided), a description, and reviews alongside a button that says \u201cFree\u201d or shows the price of the download, if the app is paid.</p><p>However, the first time you try to download an app, you\u2019ll be prompted to enable downloads if you haven\u2019t already adjusted your Android phone\u2019s security settings to enable downloads outside of Google Play. But Amazon\u2019s app walks you through the steps with ease. (See above screenshot.)</p><p>A pop-up appears explaining what you need to do, you press \u201cContinue\u201d and then the following screen tells\u00a0you the three simple steps, and provides a button that takes you directly to your phone\u2019s Security settings area.</p><p>You then make the change, and are immediately directed back to the Amazon app which says \u201cSet-up Complete,\u201d and informs you that you\u2019re now able to install applications from the Amazon app directly to your phone.</p><p>Afterwards, Amazon\u2019s app functions like any app store. You press the button to download the app, and the installation proceeds like any other.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1074841\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/screenshot_2014-10-21-15-25-01.png?w=382&amp;h=680\" alt=\"Screenshot_2014-10-21-15-25-01\" width=\"382\" height=\"680\"></p><p>What\u2019s interesting about Amazon\u2019s quiet attempt to roll out an app store within its main application, is not only the expanded reach of its app store \u2013 though that\u2019s significant \u2013 but also how the new section ties into your other Amazon activity and purchase behavior.</p><p>For example, on my Nexus 5, Amazon was able to recommend other applications base on my \u201cBook Interests,\u201d pointing me to apps for preschoolers (as I\u2019ve bought books for my daughter on Amazon.com), apps \u201cinspired by\u201d my \u201cbrowsing history,\u201d which ties together what I\u2019ve been looking for on Amazon to apps I might like (e.g. a search for \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d at some point likely inspired the recommendation of \u201cNemo\u2019s Reef\u201d). The app also recommended games for me to try, again seemingly based on my interests and prior activity.</p><p>The recommendations I saw were sort of hit-or-miss, but they\u2019ll likely get better over time as I browse more on Amazon, shop, and download more apps. This\u00a0access to a larger set of data gives\u00a0Amazon\u2019s app store \u2013 <em>sorry</em>, the Apps &amp; Games <em>Department</em> \u2013 a competitive advantage over other app stores, including Google\u2019s, which rely more on prior app download behavior and lists of what\u2019s trending across the app store as a whole.</p>", "title": ["Amazon Quietly Launches A Functional App Store Within Its Main Android Application"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

After installing the new version of the mobile application, users will be able to not only shop from their phones as before, but will also have access to the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of TV shows and movies currently available on the Prime Instant Video service.</p><p>However, Amazon has made the process of obtaining access to Prime Instant Video for Android a little convoluted. In order to begin streaming, users will first have to download and install (or update) the main\u00a0Amazon app, then will have to go into the app and use in-app tools to download and install the Amazon Instant Video player\u00a0app, which comes from the Amazon Appstore.</p><p>In addition, you\u2019ll need to enable a setting on your phone that permits you to install apps from \u201cunknown sources\u201d \u2013 meaning locations beyond the official Google Play store.</p><p>Before today\u2019s update, Amazon Instant Video was available for both iOS devices and Android tablets, including, of course, Amazon\u2019s own\u00a0Kindle Fire.</p><p>Amazon Prime Instant Video is bundled with Amazon\u2019s Prime service, which users are billed for annually. If you\u2019re not sure it\u2019s worth the cost, you can sign up for a 30-day trial, Amazon notes.</p><p>The company\u00a0has been making a big effort to increase its online video catalog over the years, and has now grown to over 200,000 movies and TV shows available to rent or buy, in addition to the tens of thousands of streaming titles. Some of the more notable streaming titles include the newly acquired HBO shows like The Sopranos, True Blood, Boardwalk Empire, Six Feet Under and The Wire.

{"date": ["2014-10-17"], "text": "<p>Increasingly, companies that compete directly with another have been announcing major partnerships, and\u00a0we saw a couple of good examples\u00a0this week with Microsoft and Salesforce and IBM and SAP. Not coincidentally in my view, they both\u00a0involved the cloud. That\u2019s because companies may want to compete, but customers want their technology vendors to just get along. They need products to play nicely together \u2013and it seems it\u2019s much easier to do that in the cloud.</p><p>We are also seeing <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/27/open-platforms-fuel-startup-ecosystems/\">entire startup ecosystems built on top of open source</a>\u00a0and when that happens companies that use the common platform can\u2019t let their competition kill the underlying golden goose. They know they have to work together to keep the project healthy and growing \u2013and compete on what makes their products special.</p><p>When companies that would normally be at each other\u2019s throats, suddenly start cooperating, they like to call it coopetition. You could call it being frenemies, but whatever you call it, for whatever reason, these companies are coming together in seemingly greater numbers \u2013and the customers are the beneficiaries. But make no mistake, the companies hope to gain something as well or they wouldn\u2019t be doing it. Just because they cooperate doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t in it to win it.</p><p>WHY CAN\u2019T WE JUST GET ALONG?</p><p>It would be a mistake to suggest that companies who are cooperating\u00a0love one another. They probably don\u2019t. They still want to beat the competition and find a way to get the upper hand, and within these agreements between competing companies, surely each one is trying to gain an advantage in the negotiation just as you would expect, but there is also an understanding that there are certain benefits\u00a0to cooperating.</p><p>Box CEO Aaron Levie told me in an interview at BoxWorks in September, companies are cooperating more today for a number of reasons, but in large part because it\u2019s just easier to do now. \u201cThe barrier to cooperation is lowered by an order of magnitude. In previous eras [companies] had to choose allies and enemies judiciously.\u00a0Today you can plug two APIs\u00a0together. The friction is no longer there. \u201d</p><p>And he says customers are demanding it because it\u2019s possible.</p><p class=\"p1\">Kevin Hart, CEO and co-founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/\"><span class=\"s1\">Eventbrite</span></a> says there\u2019s another reason we are seeing this spirit of cooperation \u2013because he says in the past companies tried to do everything and they couldn\u2019t possibly do it all well. Instead of trying to deliver a range of ancillary services, he wants his company to concentrate on what it does best. \u201cThe best startups focus on core competencies,\u201d he told me.\u00a0He added that the relationship of driving growth through partners is critical and he has connected with partner companies like DoubleDutch and Survey Monkey\u00a0because they have expertise his company lacks. That means\u00a0a startup like Eventbrite\u00a0doesn\u2019t need to waste time developing these types of functionality when these other companies do it well.</p><p class=\"p1\">COMPETITIVE FIRES STILL BURN</p><p class=\"p1\">Just because there is an easier way to cooperate, doesn\u2019t mean that competition is dead. Far from it. These companies, like athletes, still are in it to compete and win, but the cloud and open source (and APIs and standards too), all have a way of bringing these companies together on some level, even when they don\u2019t really want to cooperate with their competitors.</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.couchbase.com/\">Couchbase</a> CEO B</span>ob Wiederhold says there is some level of cooperation that happens because there is often a common platform on top of which companies are building products, but he says that just moves the competition a bit, it doesn\u2019t remove it in any fundamental way. \u201cWith open source, there may be portions of your technology stack where you\u2019re cooperating, but all that\u2019s done is shift the competitiveness of the companies to the part where you\u2019re differentiating.\u201d He adds that there\u2019s still intense competition in the market in spite of a level of cooperation that might exist for common-good reasons.</p><p class=\"p1\">A good example of this is a company\u00a0such as\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mapr.com/\">MapR</a>, which is built on the open source\u00a0Apache Hadoop project. CEO John\u00a0Schroeder isn\u2019t afraid to admit that he likes to compete and win, but there is also a level of required cooperation at the base where Hadoop is concerned. \u201cOurs is a slugfest, for sure. We like competing. It\u2019s one of the reasons I do this. Competing means there\u2019s a big brass ring you\u2019re going after and you\u2019ve got some worthy competitors and that means it\u2019s a big market opportunity.\u201d</p><p class=\"p1\">That said, he says the competitors understand that the Hadoop project is one they have to work together on to protect and preserve because it\u2019s the basis for all the businesses in the space.\u00a0\u201cWe are all interested in the adoption of Hadoop, so we try \u00a0not to let the competition hurt the adoption curve,\u201d he said. That means they tend to cooperate around issues that affect the underlying platform such as a security because it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest.</p><p class=\"p1\">Omer Artun, CEO\u00a0 &amp; founder at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.agilone.com/\">AgilOne</a> \u00a0says while he sees the upside of cooperation, he still hates his competition and wants to beat them in the worst way. But he still acknowledges that there is a spirit of cooperation among startup founders in the community that surprises him. \u201cI can pick up the phone and they would help me out, much more here [in the Silicon Valley] than anywhere else,\u201d he said. He makes clear, however that\u00a0cooperation stops when it comes to competitor companies. He\u2019s not out to make life easier for them.</p><p>THE GROWING MICROSOFT AND SALESFORCE ALLIANCE</p><p>And yet in spite of that desire to compete and win, we see companies like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/13/microsoft-and-salesforce-promise-windows-office-and-onedrive-integration/\">Microsoft and Salesforce which\u00a0compete directly in the same space coming together</a>\u00a0making agreements because it\u2019s in their best interest and the best interest of their customers. In fact,\u00a0Marc Benioff had a chummy fireside chat on stage at Dreamforce this week with\u00a0Tony Prophet, corporate vice president for Windows marketing\u00a0\u2013it was fireside\u00a0so it must have been warm and fuzzy\u00a0right?</p><p>Let\u2019s not forget at one time these two companies <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/25/salesforce-countersues-microsoft-patent-boies/\">went toe to toe in court suing one another over patent infringement</a>. Microsoft still has a CRM product called Dynamics that competes directly with Salesforce CRM, and yet they intend to extend their growing alliance because it\u2019s one that makes sense to both sides.</p><p>That\u2019s because CEO Satya Nadella has decided that being a trusted cloud vendor is more important than beating Salesforce in the CRM business, which is just a small part of\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s business anyway. It\u2019s a smart strategic decision on his part (even though it <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/30/microsoft-salesforce-partnership-is-proof-that-business-makes-strange-bedfellows/\">clearly messed up his Dynamics partner network</a>) and it gives him access via Office 365, OneDrive and Outlook.com to a stream of Salesforce customers who get the cloud and aren\u2019t afraid of it.\u00a0It solves a problem that Nadella has with his own customer base. They are slower to move to the cloud and he has the potential to gain a critical mass of cloud customers much faster this way.</p><p>For Benioff, well he gets access to all those Microsoft customers, and those companies that might have used Microsoft Dynamics CRM, might be willing to use Salesforce now that Office 365 will be so\u00a0nicely integrated into the ecosystem including\u00a0an upcoming Salesforce app for Outlook (where many sales people prefer to work). If Salesforce is more smoothly integrated into the Microsoft experience, it works in Salesforce\u2019s favor because the Office franchise remains very popular inside the enterprise.</p><p class=\"p1\">IBM HOOKS UP WITH SAP</p><p class=\"p1\">In another case of companies that quite often compete for the same customers, SAP and IBM announced a cloud partnership this week. It\u2019s not quite as strange as the one between Microsoft and Salesforce because these guys have been partnering in various guises for decades, but they admitted you could call them\u00a0frenemies in spite of the good working relationship. At least they haven\u2019t ever sued one another. SAP will be using IBM Softlayer\u2019s network of 40 data centers to run the cloud version of SAP HANA, and provide\u00a0a substantial increase over the data centers that SAP runs on its own.</p><p class=\"p1\">SAP increases the size of its worldwide data center network dramatically,\u00a0simply by writing a check and without the hassle and cost of building the data centers themselves. What\u2019s more, many of SAP\u2019s customers have data sovereignty issues, which means the data in some cases has to stay in-country. Having a network of data centers across the world increases the possibilities that there is one close by and that can mean the difference between winning and losing a sale.</p><p class=\"p1\">IBM has invested more than $1B since buying SoftLayer last year to increase its data center count from 13 to 35 with five more going on-line by the end of the year (for a total of 40).\u00a0Having a partner like SAP gives IBM a huge customer that will help begin to pay off some of that investment in new data centers. It also gives them a selling point for\u00a0other large customers that a big company like SAP with a worldwide presence is\u00a0using its\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0services. It\u2019s another win-win.</p><p>See what happens when companies\u00a0play nicely? The companies win and the customer wins too and ultimately that\u2019s why they\u00a0do it. There is an intense customer need and open source, cloud APIs and services make it easier for these competitors\u00a0to work\u00a0together. They may not ever love one another, but they understand that it\u2019s worth doing for the benefit of the business \u2013and that\u2019s why you\u2019ll continue to see companies cooperating in this fashion.</p><p>PHOTO CREDIT: <!-- HTML Credit Code for Can Stock Photo--><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.canstockphoto.com\">(c) Can Stock Photo</a></p>", "title": ["The Spirit Of Coopetition Is Alive And Well In The Cloud"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},

I, too, would want to transition out if I had to absorb calls for my head every day.</p><p>Running a public company is completely different from managing a venture-backed startup, and Twitter doesn\u2019t <span class=\"il\">have</span> the benefit of having a singular founder with voting control over the company (Facebook\u2019s greatest advantage).</p><p>The <span class=\"il\">next</span> <span class=\"il\">CEO</span> <span class=\"il\">must</span> be able to avoid Costolo\u2019s fate \u2014 they\u00a0<span class=\"il\">must</span> <span class=\"il\">have</span> ample, ample experience dealing with Wall Street. They need to be able to woo Wall Street into his or her corner while keeping Wall Street\u2019s focus on quarterly profits at bay while they upgrade <span class=\"il\">Twitter\u2019s</span> business, product and staff.</p><p>An ideal candidate for Twitter <span class=\"il\">CEO</span> will <span class=\"il\">have</span> public company experience at the C-level and experience on the boards of directors of public companies. This experience is necessary because they\u00a0will <span class=\"il\">have</span> to manage and balance quarterly calls, financial reports and hostile investors and analysts.</p><p>This experience is especially valuable for Twitter, a highly visible, underperforming company that could become an acquisition target without an improvement in its business. There are only a few <span class=\"il\">CEO</span> candidates, internal or external, who check off this crucial check box.</p><p>Twitter is not a turnaround project; it has a strong business, hundreds of millions of users and worldwide name recognition. However, it is a business in dysfunction. Its\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/28/twitter-collapses-18-in-wake-of-lackluster-q1-revenue-user-growth/\">stock collapsed</a>\u00a0after it posted a big miss on revenues. <span class=\"il\">Twitter\u2019s</span> new leader needs to find a way to restart revenue growth\u00a0to keep Wall Street at bay.</p><p><span class=\"il\">Twitter\u2019s</span> bigger dysfunction, however, has always been user growth. The Twitter product is notorious for not being able to keep new users coming back. Too many people abandon their accounts and never give it a second shot. The product <span class=\"il\">must</span> become more appealing to the masses.</p><p>This will require a clearly articulated vision for <span class=\"il\">Twitter\u2019s</span> place in the world, as well as a redesigned user experience that brings newbies back while pleasing <span class=\"il\">Twitter\u2019s</span> most hardcore users. This is not an enviable task, but fixing this dysfunction will be crucial to the success or failure of the new Twitter <span class=\"il\">CEO</span>.</p><p>In industries as competitive as consumer software and social, talent trumps all. It\u2019s no secret that Twitter has had a brain drain in recent years, losing people like\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://recode.net/2015/06/26/twitter-ma-boss-rishi-garg-departs/\">Rishi Garg</a>,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/05/29/exclusive-jess-verrilli-leaving-twitter-for-google-ventures/\">Jessica Verrilli</a>,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2015/twitter-developer-relations-head-jeff-sandquist-leaving-company-returning-to-seattle/\">Jeff Sandquist</a>,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://recode.net/2015/04/17/spiceworks-steals-away-twitter-vp-amir-movafaghi-to-prepare-for-ipo/\">Amir Movafaghi</a>,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/11/07/twitter_management_problems_dick_costolo_is_struggling_to_retain_his_vision.html\">Doug Bowman, Chloe Sladden, Jeremy Gordon</a>\u2026 the list unfortunately goes on. Today\u2019s Twitter is too heavily dominated by inexperienced talent.</p><p>Compared to Facebook and Google, with whom it regularly competes for talent, Twitter has done a poor job of recruiting and especially retention. The <span class=\"il\">next</span> <span class=\"il\">CEO</span> <span class=\"il\">must</span> <span class=\"il\">have</span> the charisma to sell a vision that will woo top recruits from Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page (no easy task). They\u00a0<span class=\"il\">must</span> quickly put together a plan to retain the talent Twitter already has. And they\u00a0<span class=\"il\">must</span> do this all quickly, while turning around <span class=\"il\">Twitter\u2019s</span> public image so it can access even more talent. A daunting task to be sure.</p><p>I lay out all of this\u00a0not because I want to criticize Twitter, but because I\u00a0<i>love</i>\u00a0Twitter and want to see it reach its true potential. Twitter at its best is a force for good in the world. It is the world\u2019s central communications hub when anything important happens in the world. It will only improve if more potential users discover that value and join the conversation.</p><p>I hope <span class=\"il\">Twitter\u2019s</span> board takes it time to find and vet its <span class=\"il\">next</span> <span class=\"il\">CEO</span>. Luckily, there are many great candidates to choose from who I believe would excel at the job, as long as the board gives the new <span class=\"il\">CEO</span> everything he or she needs to succeed.</p><p>The future of the company rides on this one decision \u2014 there may not be a second chance if Twitter gets it wrong.</p>", "title": ["The Three Qualities Twitter\u2019s Next CEO Must Have"], "author": ["Ben Parr"]},

It shouldn\u2019t need these shady tactics.</p><p>Calls, texts, and emails to Yik Yak received no reply before press time.</p><p>[Update 5pm PST: Yik Yak\u2019s co-founders Brooks Buffington and Tyler Droll have responded to me via phone, but only agreed to speak on background and not to be quoted. They say they will send me a written statement soon. When asked about their side of the situation, they did not apologize, but said their intention wasn\u2019t to suppress competitors. They say the downvoting is part of an anti-spam tool, and the minute-by-minute downvotes are designed to give posts chance to be upvoted by the community. They did admit that the tool was blunt and premature, and that they would work to improve it to delete fewer innocent posts.</p><p>At 5:45pm, Droll sent this statement: \u201cWe did not design a system to prevent other companies from gaining buzz on Yik Yak. To maintain a positive experience on the app, we do take action to help prevent people from spamming our users. Unfortunately our tool isn\u2019t perfect, and we\u2019re actively working to make it more precise.\u201d</p><p>My take is that even if it was designed to stop spam, and even if there were instances of employees or fans of these competitors aggressively promoting these apps on Yik Yak, this method of downvoting to death any post containing their names was inappropriate. There are plenty of more accurate ways to deter spam, like blocking specific device IDs.<br>\nSpamming Yik Yak would be extremely difficult anyways since posts only appear to users with a few miles. A company would need coordinated spamming by tons of people around the country to make a dent.</p><p>Well-funded, popular startups should be held to a higher standard than throwing the baby out with the bath water.]</p><p>I spoke with Fade CEO David Stewart a few days ago, and he showed me the downvoting in the wild. Here\u2019s a GIF I made from one of his example videos, and a full video from Fade showing the downvoting happening live can be seen further below.</p><p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1121174\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/screen-shot-2015-02-18-at-10-03-33-am.png?w=300&amp;h=276\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-02-18 at 10.03.33 AM\" width=\"300\" height=\"276\">Yik Yak\u00a0could claim that this is an anti-spam tool, designed to prevent other startups from blasting their names all over Yik Yak to piggyback on its growth. Many social networks delete spam, and it\u2019s completely ethical. Technically, the company\u2019s Terms Of Use permit it to \u201crefuse, delete or remove any Submissions; with or without cause and with or without notice, for any reason or no reason.\u201d</p><p>But there\u2019s no explicit prohibition of talking about other apps.\u00a0And\u00a0Yik Yak isn\u2019t just downvoting aggressive promotions of competitors like \u201cI love CollegeAppX, it\u2019s the best. Download it now!!!\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s downvoting any mention, including casual organic mentions by mutual users, and even ones that have nothing to do with apps.</p><p>If you write something on Yik Yak like \u201cwatching the sunset fade\u201d or \u201cBig dude in low-cut jeans. That cannot be unseen\u201d, the posts will still get auto-downvoted. The system sure seems designed to keep any other company from gaining buzz on Yik Yak.</p><p>This minute-by-minute downvoting into oblivion is arguably more nefarious than what Yik Yak used to do, which was immediately delete any post that mentioned a competitor. That at least made it obvious what was happening. By gradually downvoting, Yik Yak misleads users into thinking the hate was coming from their peers.</p><p>I ran my own test, and sure enough, my post got a downvote each minute until it was destroyed.</p><p>This censorship contradicts Yik Yak\u2019s stated mission of giving users an \u201corganic, unfiltered feed of news\u201d. The company\u2019s COO and co-founder Brooks Buffington <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/yik-yak-introduces-peek-feature-to-look-in-on-breaking-news-and-events-1914541.htm\">wrote that</a> Yik-Yak is \u201cdelivering organic and unfiltered truths, which cannot be said for other news mediums.\u201d</p><p>\u2026Except you still see mentions of The Washington Post in The New York Times. And while Facebook may be giving more visibility to videos uploaded to its platform than links to YouTube, it\u2019s not such a blatant anti-competitive practice that hurts underdog businesses.</p><p>One of those businesses is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://getfade.com/\">Fade, an app designed for college kids to share photos and videos that are visible for 24 hours</a>, but can gain or lose an hour of visibility if other users like or dislike them.</p><p>Fade, recently started getting reports from its users about what happened if they tried to mention Fade on Yik Yak. So the startup alerted me and\u00a0made this video. It shows exactly how Yik Yak is suppressing its competitors, and how after receiving a fifth systematic downvote at the five-minute mark, posts containing the names of competitors disappear from the feed:</p><p>In response to being blocked, later today Fade will add a \u201cNot Yik Yak\u201d button to the page in its app where users can share to other social networks. Tapping the button shows Yik Yak\u2019s logo affixed on photos of Kim Jong-un to protest Yik Yak\u2019s censorship.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1120762\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/kim-jong-yak.png?w=680&amp;h=605\" alt=\"Kim Jong Yak\" width=\"680\" height=\"605\"></p><p>Not only is Yik Yak arguably blocking competitors in a way that\u2019s unfair, its dragnet is deleting\u00a0innocent posts by its own users.</p><p>There\u2019s really no excuse for the latter, considering Yik Yak has plenty of money after <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/02/yik-yaks-new-funding-round-confirmed-as-sequoia-leads-61m-investment/\">raising a $62 million Series B round of funding</a> in November from prestigious VCs like Sequoia Capital and Kevin Colleran.

{"date": ["2013-09-14"], "text": "<p>Twitter Co-Founder Evan Williams has an ambitious new plan: to shift our daily reading habits away from consuming incremental news bites and towards engaging with enlightened ideas curated by an intelligent algorithm. Ordinarily, such a goal would seem utopian, were it not for the fact that Williams is among a handful of Internet pioneers who have disrupted the media industry multiple times.</p><p>Before Twitter terraformed the landscape of news distribution, Williams\u2019s first smash hit, Blogger, became the branded namesake for an upstart generation of amateur writers to challenge the established players</p><p>Most importantly, Medium, his new platform for publishing mostly long-form content, has quickly garnered popularity \u2014 and infamy. In only a few months, its most popular contributions are making front-page headlines and snagging millions of views. In our Silicon Valley bubble, its contributors semi-regularly spark industry wide-conversations among the Internet elite.</p><p>\u201cThe site from Twitter\u2019s co-founders is one year old, and still mysterious,\u201d <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/08/what-is-medium/278965/\">wrote</a> <em>The Atlantic</em>\u2018s Alexis Madrigal recently, in one of many stories attempting to understand the Internet multi-millionaire\u2019s enigmatic new project.</p><p>Now, for the first time since Williams launched the beta of Medium last year at our own TechCrunch Disrupt conference, Williams is ready to talk.</p><p>Williams is taking aim squarely at the news industry\u2019s most embarrassing vulnerability: the incessant need to trump up mundane happenings in order to habituate readers into needing news like a daily drug fix.</p><p>\u201cNews in general doesn\u2019t matter most of the time, and most people would be far better off if they spent their time consuming less news and more ideas that have more lasting import,\u201d he tells me during our interview inside a temporary Market Street office space that\u2019s housing Medium, until the top two floors are ready for his growing team. \u201cEven if it\u2019s fiction, it\u2019s probably better most of the time.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true. The daily news cycle doesn\u2019t always do its job at enlightening American democracy. In the aptly titled research paper, \u201cDoes the Media Matter\u201d, a team of economists <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/app.1.2.35\">found</a> that getting a randomized group of citizens to read the <em>Washington Post</em> did nothing for \u201cpolitical knowledge, stated opinions, or turnout in post-election survey and voter data.\u201d</p><p>News, alone, is evidently insufficient to make us a more informed society.</p><p>Instead, Williams argues, citizens should re-calibrate their ravenous appetite for information towards more awe-inspiring content. \u201cPublished written ideas and stories are life-changing,\u201d he gushes, recalling his early childhood fascination with books as the motivation to take on the media establishment. The Internet \u201cwas freeing that up, that excitement about knowledge that\u2019s inside of books\u2013multiplied and freed and unlocked for the world; and, the world would be better in every way.\u201d</p><p>In Williams\u2019s grand vision, the public reads for enlightenment; news takes a backseat directly in proportion to how often it leaves us more informed and inspired.</p><p>In addition to better content, the news itself might be better written by industry professionals. Climate deniers from conservative outlets, he argues, are a prime example of how the media has failed in its obligation to inform the public. During an extended rant on global warming during our conversation, he didn\u2019t complete the explanation on why industry-professionals-as-writers would solve the problem. But, it\u2019s easy to imagine that\u00a0if <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-zeller-jr/climate-change-study_b_3285245.html\">nearly all climate scientists</a> believe in man-made global warming, it would be difficult for media outlets to find a credible writer to claim otherwise.</p><p>The elephant in the room was that Williams was not-so-subtly attacking me and my colleagues, especially considering he had <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-22/twitter-co-creator-ev-williams-stretches-the-medium\">claimed</a> that \u201cthe state of tech blogs is atrocious \u2014 its utter crap.\u201d I asked him to explain what he meant, trying not to sound offended.</p><p>Diplomatically clarifying his words, he responded: \u201cPart of the reason a lot of tech blogs are bad is the people writing them don\u2019t really understand what they\u2019re writing about. And so I want to change our definition of professional writing. At least expand it.\u201d</p><p>Clearly taking a position on the long-standing debate between journalists and industry insiders, Williams says that the kinds of weekend columns TechCrunch runs from noted businesspeople \u201care absolutely more valuable\u201d than some of the daily news written by reporters with little business experience.</p><p>However, Williams was clear: \u201cplease don\u2019t set this up as Evan thinks tech blogs are crap and therefore is fixing them with Medium. People are going to publish crap on Medium.\u201d</p><p>Williams was referring to a number of infamous Medium posts that were brazenly elitist and spread misinformation. Silicon Valley entrepreneur Peter Shih\u2019s \u201c10 Things I Hate About You: San Francisco Edition,\u201d was widely criticized for, among other things, perpetuating Silicon Valley\u2019s abject misogyny and callousness toward the homeless. In another embarrasing moment, Medium contributor Michele Catalano\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/01/employer-tipped-off-police-in-pressure-cookerbackpack-gate-not-google/\">wrongly implied</a> that nefarious government spies seized her computer after she searched Google for \u201cbackpacks\u201d and \u201cpressure cookers\u201d . Both\u00a0posts were later modified or taken down. Though the missteps\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/16/peter-shih_n_3768505.html\">spawned a series</a> of thoughtful counter-posts on Medium and a handful of media outlets, Williams didn\u2019t try to spin the reactions a win.</p><p>\u201cPeople are going to publish crap on Medium\u2026. And guess what? There\u2019s crap on Twitter. There\u2019s crap on blogs. There\u2019s crap on the Internet. And if we try to keep crap off the Internet, the Internet wouldn\u2019t be important,\u201d he argues, with a noticeable defensiveness in his voice that belies his leaned-back posture. \u201cThe system\u2019s working if there\u2019s great stuff that otherwise wouldn\u2019t see the light of day and/or gets more attention than it would otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Okay then, so what\u2019s Williams\u2019s solution for putting a spotlight on the good stuff?</p><p>\u201cEveryone has a story or insight that is worth repeating and they just don\u2019t have the venue to get it heard,\u201d adds former Wired.com Editor Evan Hansen, a senior editor at Medium, charged with building out its tech, science, and business coverage. Medium sees itself as a hybrid between professional outlets like <em>The New York Times</em> and the unwashed blogger free-for-all of <em>The Huffington Post</em> (which is owned by TechCrunch parent company, Aol). Instead, Medium wants to be the platform for everyone\u2019s one truly viral idea.</p><p>Health startup entrepreneur Nick Crocker probably never thought his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/health-the-future/918b3d08f21f\">simple post</a> about a walk through the junk food aisles at his local grocery store would snag over 1 million(!) views. Crocker\u2019s rather elegantly crafted \u201cThe World Is Fucking Insane\u201d is a photo-heavy, first-person journey though grocery aisles lined with monster stacks of chemically altered sugary foods on his way to pick up some milk. Its visual simplicity evidently expressed the public\u2019s latent frustration for America\u2019s health crisis in a way that other statistics-packed medical news did not.</p><p>In another example, Aron Solomon <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/this-happened-to-me/15857aaa06f2\">put a national spotlight</a> on smartphone taxi app, Uber, after it unintentionally instituted surge pricing during Toronto\u2019s massive summer storm. A few news outlets covered the embarrassing incident, but nothing else went viral like the voice of an innocent bystander outraged at the negligent price gouging in his hair-raising post, \u201cThe Don\u2019t Be An Asshole Rule.\u201d</p><p>Most importantly, both of these posts were composed in the heat of the moment. At Medium, there\u2019s no need to register a website, \u00a0sift through a mountain of design options, and re-organize your schedule for the habit of blogging. You just write. \u201cIf it\u2019s on a whim, that whim is killed the moment you\u2019re forced to find a unique sub domain and find a template,\u201d explains Williams.</p><p>The sheer simplicity of Medium\u2019s writing platform is garnering accolades from respected writers and designers. Medium is \u201cthe best composition experience on the web, hands-down\u201d <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/8a824a0d2ef5\">wrote</a> early Facebook designer Julie Zhuo, in a Medium post about Medium (so meta). \u201cYou see exactly what your post is going to look like. There is no translation, no guess-work, no typey-typey into some fat text area and wondering whether it\u2019ll do <i>\u2018s and\u00a0</i>\u2018s and :)\u2019s correctly.\u201d</p><p><em>New York Times</em> tech columnist Nick Bilton also gives Medium a thumps up. \u201cI really like Medium \u2014 it\u2019s one of the rare instances where the technology is truly in the background,\u201d he writes to me in an email. \u201cI\u2019d love to be able to replace WordPress with Medium on my personal site.\u201d\u00a0Fortunately for WordPress, Medium has no plans to become a separate blogging platform \u2014 but, it might become home to the occasional industry muse who doesn\u2019t want to hassle with setting up a blog.</p><p>Still, Medium isn\u2019t betting that viral posts from one-hit wonders are a sustainable foundation. It has allocated a sizable budget to pay for professional magazine-style exposes. Most recently, it bankrolled a massive 10,000 word, movie-worthy script about a 62-year-old commando whose tantalizing life has included a mission to recover $3 million in gold bullion in the Peruvian mines. \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/editors-picks/ac3bd0d025f5\">Mercenary</a>\u201d was edited by the same acclaimed author whose 2007 <em>Wired</em> piece about freeing Iranian hostages eventually became the Academy Award-winning fictionalized re-enactment, <em>Argo</em>. Over the next 18 months, the partnering studio, Epic, promises five more <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pandodaily.com/2013/08/20/epic-and-medium-step-together-into-longform-experiment/\">edge-of-your-seat stories</a>.</p><p>War correspondent, David Axe, is also bringing some heavy long-form explainers a<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/war-is-boring\">bout creepy military tech to the pages of Medium</a>. Despite Medium\u2019s implied reluctance against professional writers, it\u2019s clearly willing to invest in public Internet journalism.</p><p>\u201cI always felt you couldn\u2019t live without the big expensive scoops as a serious brand in media,\u201d explains Hansen. \u201cIf you pursue the low end all the time then the advertisers want nothing to do with you. People with money and affluent readers and people with positions in the areas that you cover of authority and influence don\u2019t read you. You become kind of like, you\u2019re nothing.\u201d</p><p>Hansen maintains that Medium is still experimenting. Wherever its ends up, Medium evidently wants to be the home of any bold, viral idea \u2014 and it\u2019s willing to run a financial and engineering bulldozer over any barrier to writing.</p><p>Yet, even if writers are willing to come to Medium , how will readers find them at a still-obscure publisher?</p><p>Traditional news editors stake their reputations on having an intuition for what drives eyeballs to their sites. Editors don\u2019t, however, know whether readers leave more informed.</p><p>Williams thinks Medium has an answer: an intelligent algorithm that suggests stories, primarily based on how long users spend reading certain articles (which he\u2019s discussing publicly for the first time). Like Pandora did for music discovery, Medium\u2019s new intelligent curator aims to improve the ol\u2019 human-powered system of manually scrolling through the Internet and asking others what to read.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-877523\" alt=\"Medium\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/medium.png?w=640&amp;h=349\" width=\"640\" height=\"349\"></p><p>In the algorithm itself, Medium prioritizes time spent on an article, rather than simple page views. \u201cTime spent is not actually a value in itself, but in a world where people have infinite choices, it\u2019s a pretty good measure if people are getting value,\u201d explains Williams.</p><p>In fairness to news editors, we do know how much time readers spend on an article: We know that less than 60 percent will read more than half of an article, and a significant slice won\u2019t read anything at all. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep this brief, because you\u2019re not going to stick around for long. I\u2019ve already lost a bunch of you,\u201d <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/06/how_people_read_online_why_you_won_t_finish_this_article.html\">joked</a>\u00a0tech columnist Farhad Manjoo, in a cathartic post for Slate that was aptly titled \u201cYou Won\u2019t Finish This Article: Why People Online Don\u2019t Read To The End.\u201d</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-873076\" alt=\"This is a histogram showing how far people scroll through Slate\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/130606_tech_slatepercentscrolled-crop-original-original.jpg?w=568&amp;h=523\" width=\"568\" height=\"523\"></p><p>But, because advertisers pay for page views, the incentive is to fish for clicks, no matter how much we try to feature other kinds of higher-quality content.</p><p>For example, after Miley Cyrus\u2019 infamous burlesque dance in front of the MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards\u2019 impressionable tween audience, <em>The Onion</em> brilliantly lambasted CNN\u2019s decision to make a burlesque show front-page news.</p><p>\u201cSo, you may ask, why was this morning\u2019s top story, a spot usually given to the most important foreign or domestic news of the day, headlined \u201cMiley Cyrus Did What???\u201d and accompanied by the subhead \u201cTwerks, stuns at VMAs\u201d?,\u201d wrote The Onion, in a parody OpEd by CNN\u2019s managing editor.</p><p>\u201cThe answer is pretty simple. It was an attempt to get you to click on CNN.com so that we could drive up our web traffic, which in turn would allow us to increase our advertising revenue.\u00a0There was nothing, and I mean nothing, about that story that related to the important news of the day, the chronicling of significant human events, or the idea that journalism itself can be a force for positive change in the world.\u201d</p><p>(Another gem of an Internet response was a Tumblr of\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mileycyrustwerkingonreality.tumblr.com/page/3\">Miley Cyrus twerking on things that matter</a>.)</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-873077\" alt=\"tumblr_ms5nis7KV21sggxwdo1_1280\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/tumblr_ms5nis7kv21sggxwdo1_1280.png?w=601&amp;h=680\"><br>\nI think most of us in the news industry would love if our audience only cared about deeply substantive stories, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/02/12/quality-vs-quantity-online/\">expensive content with relatively few page views doesn\u2019t pay the bills</a>. So, what\u2019s Medium\u2019s plan to make money without advertising?</p><p>The short answer is that no one really knows. \u201cWell, it\u2019s got to be sustainable at some level. So I think revenue is in the model,\u201d says Hansen, with a casual attitude that indicates just how little focus Medium is currently devoting to the issue of monetization.</p><p>One option is selling eBooks off of its cinematic scripts. A portion of the readers may be willing to pay for the convenience of a Kindle version of \u201cMercenary,\u201d for instance. But, traffic has to be outstanding for that kind of venture to make money. Pageviews to Mercenary have been okay. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t blown the lid off,\u201d admits Hansen, in reference to other Medium pieces that snagged a few million pageviews.</p><p>Other monetization options include licensing its technology, and revenue sharing with established media brands that want to post stories on and from Medium (Mother Jones has placed some stories on Medium, while Gawker has wholesale reblogged popular Medium posts on their own site).</p><p>Though Medium doesn\u2019t have a solid business plan yet, there is a method to the madness of thinking about product first and money second (or third). Williams has a fascinating way of grouping business types in Silicon Valley between those who successfully managed companies through the dot-com bust (\u201cWeb People\u201d) and those who packed up their empty bags and left (\u201cDot-com People\u201d).</p><p>He explains that Web People \u201cloved the web. We loved what was possible and we loved the creativity and we were in it to create; we weren\u2019t in it to make money.\u201d</p><p>So, when the bubble burst, Web People stayed \u2014 some ultimately making the (very) profitable products we all use today. \u201cThe Web People are more sustainable because they kept going. Because they\u2019re driven to create, they\u2019re attracted to the web because of its creative potential. They weren\u2019t scared away when it seemed like it wasn\u2019t an instant path to riches.\u201d he explains, \u201cThey were persistent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think more people would be in a better place if more people shared their ideas,\u201d says Williams. Seen this way, Medium is just the next logical step in Williams\u2019 three-product cycle to inject better ideas into the world. Blogger helped open the doors for pajama bloggers to compete with the media moguls. A few years later, Twitter gave the power of broadcast distribution to everyone who had 140 characters to share.</p><p>Now, to complete the circuit, Medium wants to make viral information more substantive \u2014 the hope in the Pandora\u2019s box of communication. \u201cIt\u2019s also an optimistic stance to say that we can build a system where good things can shine and get attention. And there\u2019s an audience for ideas and stories that appeal to more than just the most base desires of human beings.\u201d</p><p>Or, in essence, Medium\u2019s biggest bet is, \u201cpeople will read long things \u2014 they\u2019ll read a lot.\u201d And that there\u2019s a business in this.</p>", "title": ["Twitter Co-Founder Evan Williams Lays Out His Plan For The Future Of Media"], "author": ["Gregory Ferenstein"]},

{"date": [], "text": "<p>This morning at TechCrunch Disrupt NY, Yik Yak founders Brooks Buffington and Tyler Droll spoke as to why they believe their anonymous social app has soared while others in the space have instead folded. A sort of hyperlocal anonymous Twitter, Yik Yak initially grew in popularity with a younger demographic, especially those in high schools and colleges. But being an anonymous app has its challenges, the founders quickly found out.</p><p>As the app became hugely popular with high schoolers, it started making headlines for being a home to vicious cyberbullying \u2013 something that every other anonymous app on the market has faced at some point. This is usually a make or break moment for a company.</p><p>For instance, Secret\u2019s failure to quickly address the bullying on its network <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/29/psst/\">eventually led to its downfall.</a></p><p>Yik Yak, to its credit, took a different route. Instead of turning a blind eye to the problem, the company <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/13/amid-vicious-bullying-threats-of-violence-anonymous-social-app-yik-yak-shuts-off-access-to-u-s-middle-high-school-students/\">actually shut down access to its app on high school campuses</a>. By using geo-fencing technology, Yik Yak basically banned users from reaching\u00a0its content while at school \u2013 one of the only ways that an app that doesn\u2019t have\u00a0profiles or know\u00a0its user\u00a0demographics could have blocked this segment of people\u00a0from its service.</p><p>A risky move at the time, the geo-fencing certainly could have impacted Yik Yak\u2019s then-skyrocketing growth. But as Droll explained this morning, the company wanted \u201cgood growth, not growth at all costs.\u201d</p><p>Today the app is blocked at the majority of high schools around the U.S., but is still hugely popular on college campuses. It has a presence at nearly every major university in the country, in fact.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t mean that college users are necessarily more mature when it comes to the content they post in their communities, of course. But the founders believe that anonymity, when done correctly, can have value \u2013 especially in today\u2019s ego-driven age where popularity is counted by likes and favorites and other trackable metrics across social services.</p><p>Explains Buffington, the value to anonymity on\u00a0Yik Yak is that it allows for a level playing field.</p><p>\u201cThe quiet kid is judged the same as the most popular kid,\u201d he says.</p><p>Plus, it allows users to move more freely between their multiple personas or interests, he notes. You can be who you want to be on Yik Yak.</p><p>However, while sometimes lumped into the same group of anonymous social apps that includes the now-defunct Secret, Whisper and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/21/controversial-after-school-app-relaunches-with-new-safety-features-and-zero-tolerance-for-hate/\">the latest\u00a0cyberbullying troublemaker AfterSchool</a>, Yik Yak is trying to differentiate itself by focusing first on community, and secondly on anonymity, the founders explained.</p><p>Buffington said that what people really like about the service is feeling like they\u2019re connected to that community, not the anonymous aspect. \u201cPeople feel such an attachment to this group of people,\u201d he\u00a0added.</p><p>Still, policing its community is something that Yik Yak has to carefully consider as it grows. The team currently utilizes the combination of both a smaller in-house team of moderators (who are also tasked with other duties), as well as an outsourced, overseas team of moderators. These people help to locate and remove inappropriate content on the service.</p><p>But backstage after the co-founders\u2019\u00a0chat, Droll stressed, too, that it\u2019s the Yik Yak community itself that\u00a0helps a lot when it comes to managing the content. Because the app includes an upvote and downvote mechanism, users can help keep items of lesser value from gaining in popularity. Users can\u00a0also downvote items that don\u2019t sound legitimate.</p><p>At times, this\u00a0model seems to be working. Amid a series of negative news stories moderator Jordan Crook pointed to on stage as indicative of the problems with Yik Yak\u2019s anonymous nature, the founders instead zeroed in on one that\u00a0showed how anonymity can actually be advantageous in some cases.</p><p>A U-M student <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2015/04/u-m_community_bands_together_a.html\">had posted on Yik Yak</a> they were having thoughts of suicide around exam time, and the community responded by hosting a suicide prevention rally on campus.</p><p>\u201cSomeone may not have posted that on another form of social media,\u201d said Buffington. \u201cBut here they posted that, and the community banded together as a result.\u201d</p><p>The founders also spoke of how Yik Yak has been used to bring people together for blood drives, to help users find a lost dog, or even connect two people who began dating as a result of being on the service.</p><p>That being said, Yik Yak\u2019s moderation system is <em>clearly</em> far from perfect. The company is regularly cited as a home to violent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/business/dealbook/profits-and-ethics-collide-in-nameless-turmoil.html\">threats</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://flagpole.com/news/news-features/2015/04/08/what-are-yik-yak-s-creators-doing-about-threats-and-racist-posts\">racist remarks</a>\u00a0and other unseemly content. One could even argue that it\u2019s this sort of salacious content and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2015/04/06/students-fight-back-against-yik-yak/\">gossip</a> that draws in users in the first place.</p><p>But the company <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/16/yik-yak-founders-sxsw/#.o0tzqc:TFzH\">has been working on natural language technology</a> that will help to increase its capacity for detecting the bad content, allowing it to\u00a0move beyond a sole reliance on human moderators.</p><p>Now the question for Yik Yak, which is backed by over $73.5 million in outside investment, is whether its approach to anonymous social can scale \u2013 and eventually monetize. The company says it\u2019s expanding its service into the U.K., Canada and Australia, and soon, other countries, as well. It\u2019s also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/frat-bro-says-he-was-robbed-his-share-one-hottest-apps-history-161554\">fighting off a lawsuit</a>\u00a0from an alleged third co-founder, which hasn\u2019t yet settled.</p><p>Droll said\u00a0one of the biggest challenges the company has ahead of it is expanding beyond colleges and to other countries, while Buffington noted, too, that it was critical that Yik Yak set the right tone as it arrives in these new markets.</p><p>\u201cOnce it\u2019s set, you can\u2019t change it,\u201d he said.</p><p>And of course, there\u2019s also the question of\u00a0how Yik Yak will make money \u2014 as Crook joked, \u201cdon\u2019t worry about the money\u201d is something they say in Silicon Valley, but in New York they say \u201cworry about the money\u201d \u2014 a nod to the conference\u2019s New York location.</p><p>But\u00a0that $70+ million in outside funding allows Yik Yak\u2019s\u00a0co-founders to delay thinking about monetization for some time. Local ads are in the back of their minds, said Buffington, but they are not even looking to test that yet. Instead, the company has the freedom to focus on the user experience and growth, which is what they plan to do.</p>", "title": [], "author": []},

But the approach has paid big dividends. In fact, in 2013, Emergence saw one of the industry\u2019s biggest returns with the IPO of Veeva Systems, an enterprise cloud provider for life sciences companies. In 2008, Emergence invested $4 million in the startup. When it went public, it was valued at $4.4 billion, and the firm\u2019s stake was transformed into more than $1.2 billion.</p><p>Veeva\u2019s market valuation has since slid to $3.2 billion, and Emergence has since quietly shifted its focus from SaaS startups to mobile enterprise applications. Among its newest investments:\u00a0ServiceMax, a company whose applications are used by field service workers who are tasked with, say, completing installations or warranty repairs. \u201cWe think this is a bigger trend than SaaS has been to date,\u201d says general partner Kevin Spain, who just published a\u00a0detailed<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/EmergenceCapital/mobile-enterprise-trends-2015-emergence-capital\">\u00a0industry report</a> that you\u2019ll probably want to read.</p><p>We talked with him about it Friday. More from that conversation follows.</p><p><strong>TC: What spurred you to write this \u2013 useful! \u2014 new round-up of mobile enterprise startups and how they fit into a larger ecosystem?</strong></p><p><strong>KS:</strong> People acknowledge that everyone who works now has a smart phone in their pocket, but we think most businesses have yet to really figure out how to use those devices in groundbreaking ways that mobile can uniquely unlock. It\u2019s no longer enough to have email, calendar and contacts on your phone. We think there will be a whole range of business-focused apps that will help people do their jobs in more effective ways than ever before.</p><p>We\u2019re in the early innings of entrepreneurs figuring out how big this opportunity is, too.</p><p><strong>TC: I was surprised to\u00a0learn\u00a0that, as of a year ago, at least, just <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2014/08/02/enterprise-mobile-apps-pay-the-most-yet-attract-few-developers/\">16 percent</a> of developers were focused\u00a0on enterprise\u00a0apps, even though the potential to make money with them is higher.</strong></p><p>KS: That\u2019s changing pretty rapidly. This [period] is very similar to what happened with the Web. In the late \u201890s, when the Internet came to be understood, the first place everyone focused was consumer, which made sense. Consumers are more willing to experiment with new things, and all founders are consumers themselves, so their first ideas are often consumer-oriented. But five to 10 years later, SaaS began to emerge in the business world, and we\u2019re seeing the same in mobile.</p><p><strong>TC: What are among the most interesting new apps you\u2019ve seen?</strong></p><p>KS: We think <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.plangrid.com/en\">Plangrid</a>, a mobile enterprise app that\u2019s focused on the construction industry \u2013 and not in our portfolio \u2013 is very interesting. It allows people on these multimillion-dollar sites to share the latest blueprints, track issues, and better collaborate and communicate. We obviously like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.servicemax.com/\">ServiceMax</a> [which we\u2019ve backed]. In both cases, workers who haven\u2019t historically had access to great technology now do.</p><p>There are three billion people in the world who work, and just 20 percent of them [according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.forrester.com/2013+Mobile+Workforce+Adoption+Trends/fulltext/-/E-RES89442\">data from Forrester</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_202326.pdf\">International Labour Organization</a>] sit at their desks. Now, for the first time, you can address the 80 percent of them who don\u2019t.</p><p><strong>TC: You highlight three growth areas in your report: Desktop extension apps for\u00a0employees who are deskbound and times and mobile at others; enterprise apps for entirely non-desk workers; and enterprise apps in emerging markets that are inherently \u201cmobile first.\u201d Of those three buckets, where will you spend the most time over the next five years?</strong></p><p>KS: We\u2019re seeing a lot of opportunity in this whole desk-extension opportunity. ServiceMax plays into this horizontal, as some of its users use desks. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cotap.com/\">CoTap</a>, a mobile message platform geared toward business users that we\u2019ve backed, plays into it, too, as does [the storage business] Box [backed early on by Emergence]. It helps deskbound workers take advantage of mobile in new ways.</p><p>We think the deskless enterprise is another big area and [our portfolio companies] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.doximity.com/\">Doximity</a> [the online social networking service for physicians], and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tophat.com/\">Top Hat</a> [ a mobile-based classroom response system] play into that trend. So does [Emergence-backed] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.augmedix.com/\">Augmedix</a> [a service for doctors built on smartglasses].</p><p><strong>TC: The Augmedix case\u00a0begs the question: how big a role will headsets and other wearables play in the mobile enterprise applications landscape that you foresee?</strong></p><p>KS: It\u2019s definitely bleeding edge. But the impact that companies like Augmedix are having with Google Glass demonstrates that new mobile form factors in the enterprise will be important, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be looking at other wearable opportunities going forward.</p><p><strong>TC: As for that third bucket \u2014\u00a0emerging markets?</strong></p><p>KS: Global mobile is interesting. Many of these field-based workers are outside the U.S., so we see amazing opportunities to deploy [enterprise apps] to those outside of North America. But that\u2019s probably a year or two out from an investment perspective.</p><p><strong>TC: Assuming many\u00a0more mobile enterprise apps flourish, should employees be more concerned about their privacy?</strong></p><p>KS: It\u2019s a question worth asking, because your phone knows a lot about you, including where you\u2019ve been and where you\u2019re going. Some enterprise apps will have more of that access to sensitive data like your location than others. With ServiceMax, for example, one of its key bits of functionality is route planning \u2013 telling you where your next client is and how to get there.</p><p>But in a lot of cases, the apps don\u2019t have a tremendous amount of access because there isn\u2019t a lot of need for location information. This is is something we may have to grapple with more in the future, but I think the number of applications where it will be an issue will be fairly small.</p>", "title": ["Emergence Capital, Long A Top SaaS Investor, Shifts Focus To The Next Big Thing"], "author": ["Connie Loizos"]},

Try to have the fastest-selling album ever.\u00a0Try to have the continued success for 20 years that Snoop has had (in music, movies, business) when so many musicians were just one-hit wonders.</p><p>Here are some quotes from Snoop Dogg and why I think he would be excellent as CEO of Twitter.</p><p><strong>\u201cThe most important decision I\u2019ve made in business?

Judge how he treats people.</p><p>Snoop always learned from his people mistakes (Death Row) and quickly moved to people who were better for him (Master P, Geffen).\u00a0Because of this, he released 10 successful albums in a row. I don\u2019t know of any other rappers who released that many successful albums.</p><p><strong>\u201cThere\u2019s so much that I want to do. I feel like I\u2019m the Magic Johnson of rap. You know, Magic was great on the basketball court, but he\u2019s bigger as a businessman.\u201d</strong></p><p>Snoop has constantly branched out into movies, television, investing (he\u2019s invested in Reddit, for instance) and even setting up a VC fund to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/06/of-course-he-does/\">invest in marijuana-related companies</a> now that every state, one by one, is legalizing the drug.</p><p>Everyone thinks they need to focus on one thing. To be good at \u201ctheir purpose\u201d and that\u2019s it.\u00a0This is a myth perpetrated by the beginning of the industrial age when factory owners wanted workers to just do one thing all day long, 12 hours a day. Hitting the same hammer against the same nail.</p><p>There is no one purpose. The average successful person has <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/31/hard-core-career-advice-for-a-13-year-old/\">14 different careers in their lifetime</a>.\u00a0If you stick with one thing, you never get a chance to have \u201cidea sex\u201d \u2013 to become the master of the intersection of two totally different areas.</p><p>This is how change is made; this is how innovation happens. Twitter itself is the merger of two different sectors of technology \u2014 SMS and the web.\u00a0To create success for yourself you have to venture out of your comfort zone and use the skills learned in one area to develop skills in the next area.</p><p><strong>\u201cI tell the truth. And I know what I\u2019m talking about. That\u2019s what makes me a threat.\u201d</strong></p><p>Hundreds of times I\u2019ve seen the management of public companies lie to their shareholders.</p><p>Ultimately those lies are baked into the stock price. The companies that have been as transparent as possible have seen their stock prices rise. Other companies have disappeared. I\u2019ve seen it happen over and over.</p><p>There\u2019s an interesting study that shows over the long run if you invest in the companies with the smallest SEC filings, you make more money.\u00a0Enron, for example, had footnotes covering 3,000 special-purpose entities. Whereas Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual report is only a few pages long.</p><p>Another example \u2014 a tiny company called Odeo, which created podcasting software.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t working out. The CEO was honest with his investors about Odeo\u2019s shortcomings: \u201cI\u2019ll give you all of your money back unless you want to stay invested in this tiny project we have been working on on the side.\u201d</p><p>He knew when to admit defeat and move on. I don\u2019t think the investors ever saw that before.\u00a0100% of the investors were grateful.

A leader knows that success comes from the success you help others achieve:\u00a0Snoop bringing up Warren G and Nate Dogg (and making money off of each of their albums); Snoop appearing in constant movie and TV shows.</p><p>This has catapulted him from success to success. Not hoarding what he had to offer but giving it and then receiving back 10x what he gave.\u00a0A strong leader makes his employees rich. Makes his employees learn. Makes them into the CEOs of <span class=\"aBn\"><span class=\"aQJ\">tomorrow</span></span>.\u00a0The people who don\u2019t do this fade into obscurity.</p><p><strong>\u201cIf it\u2019s flipping hamburgers at McDonald\u2019s, be the best hamburger flipper in the world. Whatever it is you do, you have to master your craft.\u201d</strong></p><p>Snoop learned the secret of mastery.\u00a0Study the history.\u00a0Work hard every day.\u00a0Combine styles to become the best at the intersection (watch his documentary \u201cReincarnated\u201d to see him combine reggae with rap).\u00a0Constantly innovate.\u00a0Surround yourself with good people.\u00a0Never slow down your creativity.

They have to exercise their options within 90 days of leaving or else lose them. And with valuations of billion-dollar companies up a stunning 59.7 percent over last year, according to CrunchBase, the amount of capital needed to buy one\u2019s options has escalated too fast for anyone who isn\u2019t already exceedingly wealthy to afford them.</p><p>Put another way, amid a sea of headlines about billion-dollar valuations are many thousands of employees who stand to lose countless millions of dollars unless companies start to go public, or else sell to an acquirer.</p><p>The issue is growing more extreme with every new \u201cunicorn,\u201d too. (For some context, 60 companies were valued at more than $1 billion last year. CrunchBase now turns up 94.)</p><p>A big part of the problem centers on the option plan structure that startups use. The 90 days that employees have to exercise their shares came out of some tax provision many decades ago when it was \u201cgenerally feasible for departing employees to pull together the money to exercise their options and pay any taxes,\u201d notes startup attorney Barry Kramer of Fenwick &amp; West.</p><p>No one expects it to change any time soon, either, given that for most companies, it still works today.</p><p>And there are a seemingly endless number of other, technical issues in the mix. For example, the so-called incentive stock options (ISOs) that employees are given used to be far more attractive before Congress changed the rules roughly a decade ago. Now some employees are subject to an Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) that they weren\u2019t prior. The longer an employee waits to buy his or her options (and they often have to wait for them to vest), the bigger the tax hit, too.</p><p>This is why companies with skyrocketing valuations are particularly dangerous for employees. Shelling out tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars is hard enough for most. You can imagine needing to pay millions of dollars to acquire your options when you don\u2019t have it.</p><p>A handful of companies, including Pinterest and Quora, have tried to ease this burden for employees by giving them <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/03/23/pinterest-employee-taxes/\">years</a>, rather than 90 days, to exercise their shares. That\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s still far from ideal. Ninety days after an employee\u2019s separation from the company, his or her ISOs automatically\u00a0convert to what are called non-qualified options (NSOs), which wind up resulting in even more taxable income. That\u2019s\u00a0\u201cstill far better than just losing the assets,\u201d as Y Combinator President Sam Altman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.samaltman.com/employee-equity\">wrote in a post</a> last year, but they still put former employees in a precarious position.</p><p>Some companies (again, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://recode.net/2015/05/08/pinterest-adds-186-million-to-series-g-round-lets-employees-sell-shares/\">including Pinterest</a>) have made it possible for employees to sell some of their shares on secondary markets to raise enough money to exercise their options and pay their taxes. But plenty of other companies have restrictions against secondary sales, for the understandable reason that they don\u2019t want just anyone to own a stake in their company (and potentially acquire information about its financial picture).</p><p>It\u2019s easy to imagine other, creative solutions.</p><p>In one scenario,\u00a0suggests Kramer, a company might allow a portion of an employee\u2019s options to be extended for a few years,\u00a0with the employee forfeiting the rest.</p><p>That might sound harsh, but put yourself in the CEOs\u2019 shoes: It\u2019s often in a company\u2019s best interest to be able to reclaim equity if an exiting employee can\u2019t afford to purchase his or her shares within 90 days of leaving.</p><p>Companies also want to keep their talented employees. This way, they\u2019d be giving employees a way to leave, but the door would be opened just a <em>teeny</em> bit.</p><p>Kramer says another approach companies might adopt would be to extend 10 percent of an employee\u2019s options for every year that he or she has worked at a\u00a0company (similarly to encourage them to stay as long as possible).</p><p>Of course, the best solution of all is for founders to focus\u00a0less on all the hassles involved in going public and spend more time thinking about what an exit might mean for the people\u00a0who\u2019ve helped them build their billion-dollar companies.</p><p>The reality is that there\u2019s a very real, very current, very unpleasant consequence to staying private. Companies are\u00a0making it too hard\u00a0for employees to leave.</p><p>\u201cTo some extent,\u201d observes\u00a0Kramer, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t seem like a horrible price to pay for those who\u2019ve generated a lot of paper wealth. But employees should have reasonable mobility.\u201d</p><p>Here\u2019s hoping\u00a0they\u00a0get it before the market turns again.</p><p><em>[Update:\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">This piece has been updated to correct statements made about the way that the Alternative Minimum Tax applies to exercised options.]</span></em></p>", "title": ["Dear Unicorn, Exit Please"], "author": ["Connie Loizos"]},

Fundraising is one of those huge obstructions. Not only is the process of finding the true believers akin to finding the proverbial needle in the haystack, it\u2019s also incredibly distracting.</p><p>Raising more money to reach a technical milestone or to fuel a successful customer acquisition strategy are worth the distraction and pain. Raising a big round because your competitor just did, essentially keeping up\u00a0with\u00a0the Startup\u00a0Joneses, is an all-too-common\u00a0waste\u00a0of\u00a0time\u00a0that can cripple your company.</p><p>I\u2019ve often seen this happen to founders of companies with seemingly \u201csuccessful\u201d competition.\u00a0Success in this case is often defined by capital raised, rather than satisfied customers. Founders become obsessed\u00a0with\u00a0the volume and valuation of a competitor\u2019s latest round of funding. In some cases, this isn\u2019t even direct competition, but tangential competition that has no bearing at all on the founder\u2019s startup.</p><p>Visions of an even larger round, using their competitors fundraise as justification, begin to take shape. After all, if a rival company\u00a0can raise $15 million with\u00a0trivial traction, why can\u2019t we? VCs intrigued by a hot category, and plagued by FOMO, will at least take a meeting \u2014 sometimes even several meetings. Multiply that by the many VCs willing to take a meeting, and the founders are focused on an unnecessary fundraising process rather than figuring out how to build a great business.</p><p>In most cases, this is a really bad idea. These competitors are noise. Their financings are extremely distracting noise. Ignore it, or you\u2019ll find yourself\u00a0wasting\u00a0time\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0Joneses\u00a0instead of building your startup.</p><p>Money should be raised\u00a0with\u00a0clear sight lines to how it will move the needle for your customers and your business, not as a reaction to competitors. Fundraising is not a legitimate forum for competition. Raising more money than competitors can give founders the false sense that they are winning. They aren\u2019t. As a result, founders lose sight of legitimate validation of winning the market.</p><p>How does a founder reconcile that a less impressive competitor has raised so much capital? Venture capital can be capricious. Investors have eclectic tastes. A particular VC may have strong relationships with\u00a0a particular entrepreneur or be privy to some market knowledge that you aren\u2019t.</p><p>In any case, it\u2019s a bad idea to assume that just because a competitor raised a huge round that it will be easy for you. It\u2019s possible that if the VC had a bad day on the first meeting\u00a0with\u00a0your competitor, the deal might never have consummated. Don\u2019t let yourself be at the whim of investors.</p><p>Don\u2019t depend on venture capitalists, or anyone other than your customers, for validation. Prove your product\u2019s value\u00a0with\u00a0traction. Remember, VCs are financiers, not oracles.</p><p>An example of this phenomena can be found by comparing the histories of Digg and Reddit. Both companies were started at roughly the same\u00a0time\u00a0and offered basically similar functionality. Reddit raised $100,000 and was quickly acquired by Conde Nast for between $10 million and $20 million. Digg raised $45 million over four rounds of financing. Many predicted Reddit would be smashed by their better-funded competitor.</p><p>However, Digg struggled to reconcile its user needs\u00a0with\u00a0the need to generate revenue, and ultimately collapsed under the weight of their investor\u2019s expectations. Reddit focused on building a community, was spun-out as a startup, and is now the 11th largest site on the web\u00a0with\u00a0a fresh $50 million in funding. This cartoon\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/pl/state_web_winter_2012/reddit_digg\">tells the story</a>\u00a0in so many words.</p><p>Could Reddit have been as successful if they spent most of their cycles keeping up\u00a0with\u00a0Digg\u2019s balance sheet? It would have been easy for Reddit to raise funding to fight Digg, but they played the long game, focused on their users and, ultimately, made the bigger impact.</p><p>Money will solve surprisingly few of your problems. Money is not what\u2019s keeping you from finding a unique way to reach your customers. You can pilot most channels\u00a0with\u00a0a few thousand dollars, and when your fundamentals work, money becomes very easy to raise.</p><p>Mailchimp and Atlassian bootstrapped their way to nine-figure revenues in the B2B market. Wayfair, a consumer-facing e-commerce company in Boston, deftly used payment terms to build a billion-dollar retail brand without funding, and first raised capital when they had more than $500 million in revenue. Money matters, but not as much as a maniacal focus on your business.</p><p>Only raise money if you know how it will make your company smarter or more valuable.</p><p>Funding should almost never be used to \u201ccatch up\u201d to a competitor. Vying for parity in product, advertising and staffing is a distraction. Fatal blows usually come from missing key insights about your users, not features.</p><p>Network-effects businesses,\u00a0with\u00a0winner-takes-all dynamics, would seem to be an exception to this rule. However, Facebook is the clear winner in social networking, despite that MySpace had no shortage of capital supporting its implosion.</p><p>Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, WhatsApp, WeChat and others managed to carve out multi-billion dollar niches, not by copying Facebook or by being equally capitalized, but by amplifying key aspects of it.</p><p>Instead of trying to catch up to a competitor, think about how you can use capital to uniquely serve a subset of the market. Don\u2019t use money to close a gap in a race, use it to change the game. If capital was the key ingredient to success, no startup would stand a chance against well-funded incumbents. Yet startups successfully take on incumbents every day\u00a0with\u00a0a sliver of the capital.</p><p>Money can actually slow down startups, a problem I\u2019ve referred to as \u201c<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/24/after-funding-watch-burn-rates-and-beware-the-tyranny-of-incrementalism/\">Tyranny of Incrementalism</a>.\u201d</p><p>This is what happens when a company closes capital and long-awaited VPs are hired, who in turn hire directors and analysts, and have requests for budget. Progress against the product roadmap slows as more people need to be brought up to speed. Previously successful marketing strategies begin to stall at scale. The larger the ship, the harder it is to turn.</p><p>Often the speed you hoped to achieve is retarded by the growing pains. These slowdowns are compounded when the executive team doesn\u2019t have a clear view of how to apply the dollars. Gas in the tank fuels the engine \u2014 bathing your car in gas is a disaster waiting to happen.</p><p>Frothy funding environments reinforce bad habits. Venture capital is a tool designed for a very specific purpose. It\u2019s hyperdrive. If you lay in the proper course, it will take you far. If you haven\u2019t, you\u2019ll just be way off the mark and beyond the reach of anyone to save you.</p><p>Almost every CEO of a failed startup will blame a lack of cash for their company\u2019s demise. And there is no doubt that many a startup has been subject to the whims of the capital markets, but the reality is, if you make customers happy, develop a business model that jibes\u00a0with\u00a0your product and have patience, there is very little that can keep you from success \u2014 no matter how much more money the\u00a0Joneses\u00a0raise.</p>", "title": ["Wasting Time With The Joneses"], "author": ["Eric Paley"]},
{"date": ["2013-02-11"], "text": "<p>As Facebook\u2019s growth began to accelerate exponentially in 2009 and 2010 and its platform began to emerge, the opportunities for businesses to leverage and apply its social graph in other industries seemed endless. In particular, many saw the social graph as having a fundamentally disruptive influence on eCommerce and it was about that time that investors and entrepreneurs began dumping lots of time and money into building new online storefronts on top of and around Facebook\u2019s burgeoning platform. </p><p>One of the many startups playing in this space was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://yardsellr.com/\">Yardsellr</a>, a startup created by former eBay executives, which aspired to become the \u201ceBay for Facebook\u201d \u2014 without the auctions. In 2010, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/22/yardsellr-5-million-ebay-facebook/\">the startup raised $5 million from Accel</a> and when TechCrunch <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/20/yardsellr-the-ebay-for-facebook-grows-to-5-million-strong-rebrands-launches-marketplace-for-fashion/\">caught up with Yardsellr in the fall of 2011</a>, things seemed to be looking up. </p><p>At the time, the social commerce platform claimed that it had grown into a community of over 5 million users, its local sellers were listing 6K new items for sale each day and the platform listed over 120K items for sale in total. However, at the time, only 175K of its 5 million users were active on the site each month \u2014 usage or stickiness, which, in retrospect, might have rung a bell. </p><p>Fast forward a year and a half and things haven\u2019t been going as well as the founders had imagined. Last week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://yardsellr.com/blog/2013/02/general-information-about-yardsellr-sunset/\">Yardsellr announced that</a> it would be shutting down operations in the next 60 days. </p><p>Why? While Yardsellr may have created a social and gamified channel by which local sellers could increase their ability to make a few bucks selling their wares, there had been too much competition, adaptation from incumbents and the social commerce management business model ended up being less attractive than Yardsellr had hoped.</p><p>In its announcement last week, the team explained: </p><p>Essentially, the B2B services model ended up being more attractive \u2014 at least in Yardsellr\u2019s eyes \u2014 than the alternative. So, the company has decided to shut down its current model and start fresh with a new one. The post goes on to say that the company will quickly be transitioning to a new business as a result \u2014 called \u201cCompoundM\u201d \u2014 that will launch in \u201ca few weeks.\u201d Otherwise, everything else on Yardsellr will essentially be shut down in the next 30 to 60 days. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://yardsellr.com/blog/2013/02/general-information-about-yardsellr-sunset/\">More on that here</a>.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-11-at-5-00-54-am.png\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-11-at-5-00-54-am.png?w=680&amp;h=339\" alt=\"Screen shot 2013-02-11 at 5.00.54 AM\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-755141\"></a></p><p>It\u2019s a disappointing conclusion for a company that was founded by three former eBay executives \u2014 CEO Daniel Leffel is a former manager at eBay, VP of Marketing Jed Clevenger used to run the paid search team at eBay and VP of Community Rachel Makool used to run the community team at eBay. In addition, early investor Michael Dearing of Harrison Metal was a former SVP of eBay. At one point, Leffel had even predicted that Yardsellr could be as big as eBay.</p><p>Not quite. In fact, eBay has continued to thrive as many of the startups that have popped up in local commerce, f-Commerce (or Facebook commerce) and the like have been forced to pivot, sell or consider alternative ways to make money. It\u2019s difficult to find a model that is incentivized in such a way that it can convince local merchants to make it their sole destination for selling, especially when there are so many options. Managing that interface between an infinite variety of sellers and buyers is a difficult proposition. </p><p>Of course, naturally, in Yardsellr\u2019s case, those merchants have been, unsurprisingly, less than excited to hear the news that one of their sales and distribution channels will be no more. One seller commented on the announcement saying, \u201cI got out of YS months ago, when they raised their fees and started making the sellers pay them. Their customer service sucks, they never responded to any emails and the photons were just crap. It just sucks that a lot of people will be out of money because of this, but at least now they can\u2019t do it to anyone else in the future\u2026\u201d</p><p>While another commented, \u201cI agree that things should not have been implied, costs should not have jumped, especially when the possibility of shut down was so high. I\u2019m very glad I didn\u2019t drop any more [money] into buying photons and boosts. This has been pretty much a bummer for me. I have several platforms that I sell on and [Yardsellr] and Etsy have been my best, however, I have 73 sales on [Yardsellr] in less than one year and it is my #1 selling platform. Now I have to figure out where to go next. That\u2019s the part I am struggling with.\u201d</p><p>Keep in mind, these are sellers reacting after they just learned that the site was shutting down, so emotions are a bit heated, and some went even further to suggest some foul play \u2014 that the company ramped up its sales of Photons to merchants (its virtual currency) even though it knew it would be shutting down. </p><p>In its defense, Yardsellr claims that they\u2019re doing their best not to abandon their sellers and will be paying out all the money that is owed to merchants from outstanding transactions. \u201cAs always,\u201d it responded to one commenter, \u201cYardsellr will pay sellers in the method they\u2019ve chosen (Direct Deposit, PayPal or Check) for all legitimate sales with valid tracking,\u201d even though that means that, at the end of 60 days, some merchants who just invested in putting inventory on the site or in buying up Photons, may be left holding.</p><p>Naturally, while some sellers even offered to purchase Yardsellr\u2019s platform and help sell it or keep it going, most seemed more concerned about where they would take their business next. In response, Fredrick Nijm of Facebook-integrated <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/30/addoway-is-like-ebay-with-a-social-streak/\">eCommerce site Addoway</a> tells us that, within 48 hours of Yardsellr\u2019s announcement, the company had received requests from \u201chundreds of sellers wanting to shift platforms because they had no place to go.\u201d In response, Addoway built a Yardsellr importer to make it easier for merchants to port their businesses to a new home, even if temporary.</p><p>That\u2019s all well and good, Addoway at the very least continues to operate and grow, albeit slowly (the founder claims that its marketplace will hit $1.2 million in sales this year \u2014 just about three years removed from its launch), but, overall, it seems to be another example of a growing trend: The struggles of social and f-commerce platforms to maintain a business, especially for those not selling under a B2B or services model. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-11-at-5-01-09-am.png\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screen-shot-2013-02-11-at-5-01-09-am.png?w=300&amp;h=123\" alt=\"Screen shot 2013-02-11 at 5.01.09 AM\" width=\"300\" height=\"123\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-755142\"></a>Yardsellr is the latest in a series of closures and pivots. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.done.com/\">Done.com</a>, for example, is no longer operational, in spite of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://angel.co/done-com\">a promising team and promising interest from early investors</a>. Furthermore, the Facebook-based social auction site, Boocoo, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abn/y12/m12/i07/s01\">closed its doors in December</a>, local commerce marketplace, Peddl, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://terrarium.io/peddl/\">closed at the end of January</a> and NBC <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/07/nbc-shutters-hyper-local-news-and-information-site-everyblock-after-failing-to-find-the-right-business-model/\">shuttered its  Knight Foundation-backed local news and information marketplace, EveryBlock, after</a> \u201cfailing to find the right business model.\u201d </p><p>In turn, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/28/facebook-e-commerce-platform-payvment-shuts-down-merchants-moved-to-ecwid/\">Payvment announced recently that it was shutting down</a> and, seeing a good deal, Intuit quickly swooped in to buy its team, technology and patents. Of course, in spite of the fact that Payvment had grown to \u201chundreds of thousands of merchants,\u201d it still struggled to find any traction in f-commerce. </p><p>Intuit didn\u2019t want to touch the actual business \u2014 just wanted the raw materials, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/28/facebook-e-commerce-platform-payvment-shuts-down-merchants-moved-to-ecwid/\">Josh wrote at the time</a> \u2014 so they essentially gave their 200,000 merchants to its largest competitor, Ecwid, which, in turn, made Ecwid the Facebook store-builder with the most monthly active users, according to the report.</p><p>It\u2019s not a hopeful series of outcomes for those trying to build a profitable businesses around f-commerce, hyper-local networks or social commerce. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.zaarly.com/\">Zaarly</a>, the much touted and well-funded startup that had focused on building a mobile-first, reverse craigslist platform for local buyers and sellers, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/zaarly-storefronts/\">launched \u201cStorefronts\u201d last September</a> to give their top service providers/sellers a better way to showcase their talents and wares to customers. </p><p>Since then, the startup has completely abandoned its original business to focus exclusively on its merchants service \u2014 on becoming a less-crafts-oriented, more mobile-centric version of Etsy. Zaarly Co-founder Eric Koester tell us that they\u2019ve been finding increasing success since pivoting, but there\u2019s still a long road ahead.</p><p>Naturally, those companies that are still operating in this space are now left to vie for Yardsellr\u2019s free-floating merchants and to pick up the spoils, though it looks like Addoway has a head-start on that front.</p><p>In a way, it\u2019s not surprising that yet another segment of the consumer tech space is feeling the series A crunch and is experiencing contraction and consolidation. (Another example from social commerce? Take <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://valleybizdaily.com/2012/09/07/ebay-acquires-svpply-social-commerce-moving-consolidation/146/\">Ebay\u2019s recent purchase of Svpply</a>). It could be a matter of timing. After all, Facebook commerce may be huge one day, but in the present, consumers are more interested in \u201cliking\u201d articles, writing status updates, sharing photos and connecting with friends \u2014 not in using Facebook as a destination for purchasing or commerce. Today, social commerce-as-a-service businesses \u2014 or those that offer social as a layer to be integrated into or on top of existing platforms are surviving, but the rest are finding it difficult to survive. </p><p>Yes, local marketplaces and commerce continue to be attractive and niche services continue to emerge around local transactions, but hyper-local online services that rely on local advertising, for example, are finding a bumpy road. There are multiple forces at play here, so it would be reductive to pin the decay of these sites on a single cause. </p><p>But it is safe to say that building a sizable two-sided marketplace is extremely difficult. As <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2013/02/07/5-tips-for-building-a-two-sided-online-marketplace/\">Boris Wertz recently pointed out</a>, businesses like Airbnb and Ebay have made this process look easy and have shown that the model can work like a dream at scale. Of course, the chicken-and-egg problem (among others) make it really tough for young companies to reach that kind of scale. </p><p>Growth for fledgling local marketplaces is slow, as Addoway\u2019s aforementioned growth shows, and it requires capital to sustain the business over time, focusing intently on achieving a slow-burn rate and avoiding the temptation to pivot too early. With Yardsellr\u2019s decline as further evidence, in these conditions the downsides of f-commerce, social commerce and local commerce are becoming increasingly apparent. And, as always, when a space becomes overrun by me-too companies and models, contraction seems inevitable \u2014 if not necessary.</p>", "title": ["Yardsellr, The \u201ceBay For Facebook,\u201d Becomes The Latest Casualty In Social & Local Commerce"], "author": ["Rip Empson"]},

But, really, as some already know, the shift started back in September \u2014 <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/05/zaarly-storefronts/\">with the launch of \u201cStorefronts\u201d</a> for Zaarly sellers.</p><p>Just as it sounds, Zaarly\u2019s new Storefronts provide local merchants or sellers with customer-facing websites that allow them to showcase (and sell) their goods and services, essentially leveraging the Etsy (and Shopify) model(s). Now, instead of enabling users to request anything and everything, Zaarly enables its merchants to offer relative certainty (of identity, inventory and delivery, for example) and proactively market their products to customers, receive orders, payment, confirm details, and so on.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-08-at-7-24-19-pm.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-774098\" alt=\"Screen shot 2013-03-08 at 7.24.19 PM\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-08-at-7-24-19-pm.png?w=680&amp;h=409\"></a></p><p>In fact, Fishback tells us that the decision to drop the peer-to-peer model and focus exclusively on its merchant product was the result of a number of stressful, white-knuckled internal conversations that took place over months. Coupled with metrics on the original marketplace, it became increasingly clear that the new direction was necessary.</p><p>The founder still remains hopeful that the \u201crequest model\u201d can be integrated into the new platform, but the hard truth is that its original concept was just more of a feature than a service, or a real business. Fishback scribed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quora.com/Zaarly/Why-did-Zaarly-pivot\">a pretty excellent response on Quora</a> to the question of why Zaarly pivoted in September (when they launched Storefronts), which is a must read. But his answer is telling in terms of how the experimentations with the request marketplace informed the new direction.</p><p>While some predicted that the \u201crequest model\u201d of Zaarly\u2019s P2P marketplace would make it difficult to establish a significant level of trust (and quality), Fishback tells us the real issue was actually one of certainty. A startup doesn\u2019t enter the market with the trust of an established brand or guaranteed supply, so that a pure request model \u201cis like going fishing in a black water pond,\u201d he says. If you don\u2019t know if there are any fish in the pond, or what kind of fish are there, why would you fish? (Well, you might, but only if you also enjoy herding cats. Or you\u2019re a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/h/henrydavid107147.html\">friend of misquoted Thoreau</a>.)</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.quora.com/Zaarly/Why-did-Zaarly-pivot\">In his Quora post</a>, Fishback explains that, in a marketplace like this, startups can either try to guarantee supply for certain services or recommend/surface items that they know have plenty of supply or show off the supply they do have. Zaarly chose to do the latter, but highly empowered buyers are in short supply, and the request model only worked for \u201ca small segment of buyers.\u201d</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-08-at-7-49-13-pm.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-774100\" alt=\"Screen shot 2013-03-08 at 7.49.13 PM\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-08-at-7-49-13-pm.png?w=188&amp;h=283\" width=\"188\" height=\"283\"></a>Instead, they found that the key was to show off the most talented sellers, and in designing its new direction, Zaarly started with those who were the most active and popular sellers. To guarantee quality in its new marketplace, the startup handpicks from an applicant pool, using a dozen different touchpoints when vetting candidates. Most just do a background check, but Fishback says that these sellers need to have a number of referrals, and need to have reviews up and running on the site.</p><p>The startup spends time interviewing them, getting to know them, because it wants to help them build sustainable online businesses, and if sellers aren\u2019t responding promptly, can\u2019t demonstrate an existing network (and three or four referrals) or the ability to sell quality items, then it declines. It\u2019s a high-touch way of vetting candidates, not the same as just filling out a short online form and getting up and running in 15 minutes. Zaarly has an editorial team that helps sellers create the text in which they describe their goods or services, and, taking a page from the Airbnb model, sends a photographer to take photos of their products.</p><p>Over time, it wants to reduce the amount of involvement in the process, but, at the outset, high-touch curation guarantees quality. Fishback says that its \u201crequest model\u201d (while once <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/14/zaarly-crosses-1m-in-jobs-posted-in-just-under-a-month/\">did $1 million in transactions</a> in a month) in the end only had a 10 to 20 percent close rate, but with its Storefronts, that has flipped to over 90 percent. The other incentive for sellers is asking them what they want to make from their products and does its best to guarantee that. Using an eTail markup, if they want to make $200, Zaarly includes its own 10 percent fee and lists the item for $220.</p><p>Today, Zaarly has over 750 merchants on the platform, offering everything from custom meals (and delivery) and home service and repair to custom speakers, music lessons and event planning. So, like Etsy, a large portion of Zaarly\u2019s sellers are women (70 percent), but, unlike Etsy, the platform isn\u2019t just offering homemade, handcrafted goods \u2014 although that\u2019s a part of it.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-08-at-7-23-08-pm.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-774099\" alt=\"Screen shot 2013-03-08 at 7.23.08 PM\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-08-at-7-23-08-pm.png?w=300&amp;h=227\" width=\"300\" height=\"227\"></a>Sellers are now making between $1,500 and $2,000 per month on average, with the highest grossing doing between $6 and $7,000. The idea is to provide the world\u2019s hobbyists who have a particular talent, something they\u2019ve been doing for years, and give them a supplemental revenue stream \u2013 help pay their rent. Fishback said that some are already quitting their jobs to manage their storefronts full-time, and that\u2019s the startup\u2019s end goal for all of them.</p><p>There\u2019s still a long way to go, but the founder says that it was almost relieving to be able to focus on one thing, especially since the new marketplace is growing in a way the initial idea wasn\u2019t. He thinks this one is much closer to finding product-market fit. Going forward, the next steps for Storefronts are to add more management tools for sellers, in the way that Groupon has been doing for its merchants, whether it be inventory management tools, scheduling or sharing tools.</p><p>Storefronts have launched in San Francisco, Seattle and Kansas City (where Fishback is from) and it\u2019s about to go live in New York, with Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and Portland all potentially following the Big Apple.</p><p>As to Koester, the departed co-founder, he tells us that \u201cWhile I wanted to write something very \u2018Andrew Mason-y\u2019 about leaving Zaarly, I quickly realized that I just couldn\u2019t come up with anything that damn hilarious. I love Zaarly and the team, believe in the direction of Storefronts, but the time was right to start working on my next startup. Am excited to share more about that soon.\u201d More <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ekoester.com/the-decision-to-move-on\">in his blog post here.</a></p><p>It may be the end of the request-driven marketplace, or it may not. Time will tell. If Zaarly can scale Storefronts and maintain quality, there\u2019s a chance it could make a return. After all, we\u2019ve heard from sources that Zaarly is now doubling transactions every month and looking to raise a B round. If that\u2019s true, Zaarly may just become the first to pivot into an eBay acquisition. Though with Whitman on the board, that could be awkward.</p><p>For more, find <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.zaarly.com/\">Zaarly at home here.</a></p>", "title": ["Zaarly Shutters Its Reverse Craigslist Marketplace, Goes All In On Virtual Storefronts As Co-Founder Exits"], "author": ["Rip Empson"]},

The founder of Yammer, who <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/19/microsoft-completes-its-1-2b-yammer-acquisition/\">sold his company to Microsoft for $1.2 billion</a> about two-and-a-half years ago, has decided he\u2019s had enough time off and is joining fast-growing cloud HR startup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zenefits.com\">Zenefits</a> as its new COO.</p><p>Sacks has been a Valley mainstay for the last 15 years. He joined PayPal as its first COO in 1999, leaving his management consultant job at McKinsey to become a member of the PayPal Mafia. In 2006 he founded genealogy website Geni.com, which was sold to MyHeritage in 2012, but not before the company\u2019s internal communications tool Yammer was spun out. And we all know how that turned out.</p><p>So if you\u2019re Sacks and you sold your last company for more than a billion dollars, why do you join Zenefits? Or really, go back to work at all?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only so much poker I can play,\u201d Sacks said in a phone interview.</p><p>More seriously, Sacks says he\u2019s spent the last few years angel investing and even flirted with the idea of becoming a full-time VC. But when push came to shove, he realized what he really wanted to do was go back to working on companies and building things.</p><p>The new role at Zenefits will pose a unique challenge for Sacks. Unlike his previous startups, which he either founded himself or got it at the ground floor, Zenefits has also scaled pretty substantially over the past few years. Being a part of that hyper-growth environment is part of what excites him about joining the company.</p><p>\u201cWhat took Yammer three years to do, Zenefits did in one year\u2026 I\u2019ve got experience in product and operations and issues related to hyper growth, and there\u2019s a version of that here,\u201d Sacks said.</p><p>When talking about the hire, Zenefits co-founder and CEO Parker Conrad said he sees Sacks as a partner in the business. And according to Conrad, all operations, finance, and product will report up through the new COO. That said, he also acknowledged that Sacks\u2019 background at PayPal and Yammer will help to manage Zenefits through this hyper-growth phase.</p><p>\u201cI expect David will be working on lots of different problems,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cWherever the fires are hottest is where he\u2019ll be focused.\u201d</p><p>While he\u2019s thrilled to have Sacks on board, Conrad said Zenefits wasn\u2019t necessarily looking for a COO at the time discussions began. The conversation began after Conrad spoke with Andreessen Horowitz general partner and Zenefits board member Lars Dalgaard about the possibility.</p><p>As Conrad tells it, Dalgaard asked if he had considered adding a COO to reduce some of the pressure of running such a fast-growing company. But Conrad was pretty opposed to the idea until Sacks was mentioned as a possible candidate.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want a big company bureaucrat,\u201d Conrad says. \u201cBut Lars asked, \u2018What if it was David Sacks?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018You mean, <em>Yammer David Sacks</em>?'\u201d</p><p>An intro was made soon after, with Conrad and Sacks first meeting the week before Thanksgiving. After spending several days together, it was clear they both wanted to be on the same team. Soon after they reached an agreement whereby Sacks would not only join as COO but also made an investment in the company and join the Zenefits board.</p><p>Sacks isn\u2019t disclosing the size of the investment, but did say it was significant. \u201cThis is the biggest investment I\u2019ve made in a startup, and it represents my commitment to the company,\u201d he told me.</p><p>The investment shows Sacks has some skin in the game, but he says it\u2019s secondary to the amount of work he expects to do as a part of the team. \u201cI\u2019ve been angel investing in companies for a long time, so that part isn\u2019t unique\u2026 I just think this company is so exciting and special that I want to spend all my time on it,\u201d Sacks said.</p>", "title": ["Yammer Founder David Sacks Joins Cloud HR Startup Zenefits As COO"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

That\u2019s why a startup called\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://usesold.com/\">Sold</a>, launched\u00a0earlier this year, had me intrigued. Its big idea is to take the whole e-commerce process out of your hands by pricing your items for you, finding a buyer, sending you packaging, handling shipping, completing the transaction, and then getting you paid. Today, Sold is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.terrarium.sold\">launching on Android</a>, following its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/11/backed-by-google-ventures-greylock-sold-launches-a-mobile-service-that-takes-the-hassle-out-of-selling-online/\">iOS debut back in April.</a></p><p>The company was founded by Matthew Blackshaw, Tony DeVincenzi and D\u00e1vid Lakatos, who believed that a better way to add value in e-commerce marketplaces is not to try to reinvent or topple Craigslist or other established sites \u2013 something many startups, including\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/09/zaarly-shutters-its-reverse-craigslist-marketplace-goes-all-in-on-virtual-storefronts-as-co-founder-exits/\">Zaarly</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/11/yardsellr-the-ebay-for-facebook-becomes-the-latest-casualty-in-social-local-commerce/\">YardSellr</a>, and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/11/mobile-marketplace-eggdrop-shuts-down-following-craigslist-cd-but-says-slow-growth-to-blame/\">EggDrop</a>,\u00a0have tried and failed to do. Instead, they realized that a new approach focused on simplifying the way we sell online could be an unexplored niche still ripe for change.</p><p>The company already has seed funding from investors, including\u00a0Google Ventures (Rich Miner), Greylock Partners (Reid Hoffman), Matrix Partners (Antonio Rodriguez) and the team at Boston Seed.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/24/sold-the-app-that-sells-your-stuff-for-you-arrives-on-android/sold-android2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-882892\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-882892\" alt=\"Sold -android2\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/sold-android2.png?w=218&amp;h=384\" width=\"218\" height=\"384\"></a>Today, Sold says it has more than 2,000 unique products in its marketplace, and saw 50 percent growth in items posted last month. Its prices are on average 43 percent higher than Gazelle\u2019s, which it attributes to its pricing engine technology. The company uses\u00a0algorithms and scrapers to crawl top e-commerce marketplaces, like Craigslist, eBay, and Amazon product search to build its pricing database, allowing it to know the \u201cgoing rates\u201d for your items, and where those items are selling for more.</p><p>To date, the highest priced item it has sold so far was an $8,000 watch, but the average purchase price of items falls around $262 \u2013 two times greater than eBay\u2019s, the company points out. However, that\u2019s because currently, Sold is focused on users selling electronics (computers, phones, tablets, etc.) and other accessories (handbags, sunglasses, watches and shoes). Though, technically, it could sell anything (legal) that fits into its largest box size (16\u2033 x 16\u2033 x 12\u2033).</p><p>While there aren\u2019t additional fees or surprise charges, as <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/11/backed-by-google-ventures-greylock-sold-launches-a-mobile-service-that-takes-the-hassle-out-of-selling-online/\">TechCrunch previously noted,</a> its pricing includes the service charge for the marketplace it sells your item on, as well as its own bundled-in fee and margin. But this is all presented to the seller as one price, which they can choose to accept or reject upfront before making the sale.</p><p>Co-founder DeVincenzi tells us that Sold is now projecting $1 million in annual revenue as of its first 90 days and is still growing.</p><p>With the debut on Android, the service has sped up to be twice as fast as before, going from post to payment in as little as four days on some occasions, and even sees popular items sold within an hour.

Backed by $1.2 million from investors like Google Ventures, Greylock Partners, Matrix Partners and the team at Boston Seed, it\u2019s a somewhat abrupt exit for a startup that appeared to be on the way up. In September, the team told TechCrunch that it had listed more than 2,000 unique products in its marketplace and was seeing 50 percent growth, month-over-month.</p><p>In turn, beyond the fact that Sold sought to add value by reducing the work inherent to selling online by pricing items, finding a buyer and arranging packaging, shipping and transactions for you, the startup also created pricing technology to help you get more for your items. Thanks to its algorithms that crawl top e-commerce marketplaces to build more accurate pricing rates and to allow customers to compare \u201cgoing rates,\u201d Sold said at the time that its prices were (on average) 43 percent higher, on average, than that of Gazelle.</p><p>As a result, after just four months, the startup was projecting $1 million in annual revenue and claimed to be growing fast. Nonetheless, the opportunity to join Dropbox ultimately proved to have more appeal for the founders than what they thought could be accomplished as an independent company. The deal, which Sold co-founder Tony DeVincenzi says came together in under four weeks, will see the startup\u2019s nine full-time employees join Dropbox to form a new team within the company that will lead the design and development of \u201ca new Dropbox product.\u201d</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-04-at-5-46-55-pm.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-910076\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-11-04 at 5.46.55 PM\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/screen-shot-2013-11-04-at-5-46-55-pm.png?w=640\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\"></a></p><p>Although the co-founders declined to elaborate on the plans for the new product, they did say via a post on their site that Dropbox\u2019s \u201croadmap includes exciting new experiences which align perfectly with our ethos of creating products that positively affect people.\u201d While that doesn\u2019t say much, it is clear that the opportunity to reach Dropbox\u2019s user base of 200 million played a hand in determining the outcome. That opportunity, they said, \u201cwas too good to pass up.\u201d</p><p>Sold will be officially shutting down its product beginning today, and as of now, is no longer accepting new items. DeVincenzi says that the team is putting together a plan to help users finalize transactions and those who currently have items in the system have been contacted and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Considering that the launch of its Android app in September had allowed Sold to significantly speed up its streamlined e-commerce process \u2014 allowing users to move from first post to payment in four days \u2014 the abrupt end to its service will no doubt have some of its newest customers up in arms. But, depending on what the Sold team helps Dropbox produce in the coming months, maybe they won\u2019t be without a mobile commerce platform for long.</p><p>Stay tuned for more.</p><p>Full announcement copied below:</p>", "title": ["Dropbox Snatches Up Sold, The Service That Simplifies Selling Online, To Help It Build A New Mystery Commerce Product"], "author": ["Rip Empson"]},

Many people here in Asia believe that the economic disaster that befell them actually pushed the current wave of entrepreneurs on to this track of newfound wealth.</p><p>Back in 1997, a region of\u00a0more than\u00a0two billion people \u2014 ruled by autocrats, socialist democracies, monarchies and various crumbling versions of government \u2014 found their economic growth story stone-cold frozen.</p><p>In the past two or three years, this complex ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) economic story is simplifying and reversing, as everyone from Silicon Valley super angels to China\u2019s homegrown billionaire founders are boiling up new recipes for growth in venture capital and tech startups by putting money into anything local and anything mobile, cloud and IoT.</p><p>The boom is palpable. In the first quarter of 2015, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://e27.co/apac-captured-us9-4-billion-in-vc-funding-in-q1-2015-report-20150408/\">APAC region secured $9.4 billion (U.S.)\u00a0in VC investments</a>.</p><p>Part of Q2\u2019s wave has included Dave McClure and his 500 Startups posse, who just invested\u00a0an undisclosed sum into Hubba Thailand, the first co-working space in the country, with the hope of harnessing this complexity and this new momentum.</p><p>Anita Chan,\u00a0half of the duo building <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://samthelocal.com/\">Sam the Local,</a> a bespoke local travel agency-as-an-app, says that it\u2019s actually the complexity of ASEAN and the rush of investment dollars into the market that makes it such a great time to be a local investor and founder.</p><p>\u201cWith so many different elements going into play with each Asian country and their unique culture and language, we think now is a good time for us to connect them and for us to learn from each other,\u201d says Chan, who is based in Hong Kong with her co-founder, Maggie Lau. \u201cWe believe,\u201d Chan added, \u201dthe human communication will help to make the world a more connected place and allow us to further understand all of these elements.\u201d</p><p>From industries moving to mobile, to merchants tapping into ASEAN and China\u2019s growing consumer market through e-commerce, founders are finding that in Asia, if you want to\u00a0grow, you have to master media as well as tech, because growth is all about conversations that build trust and weave communities together.</p><p>The reason could be simple. Relationships work first, then money. Media companies and media professionals in Asia are finally getting their due, being asked\u00a0on board\u00a0companies to help stitch together vastly disparate market sectors and companies.</p><p>This is part of something called Internet Plus, a term created by some Hong Kong government agencies as part of marketing attempts to boost investment in mobile and cloud tech for traditional industries.</p><p>App marketing executive Jason Chiu of CherryPicks thinks this is where the future is\u00a0for all of Asia. \u201cThe next wave, a huge wave, is to get into the IoT\u2026putting internet technologies in traditional industries,\u201d says Chiu. \u201cIf you are the guy who knows both industries, you will have a unique advantage, because of cloud, mobile, advanced material and big data, it makes it possible the traditional industries are now ready to be combined.\u201d</p><p>If he were a new tech founder, \u201c[he] would find interdisciplinary resources so that [he] gets a team where the team knows both sides. That\u2019s where creativity and innovation gets very interesting.\u201d</p><p>Pony Ma, founder and chairman of Tencent, may agree. He<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.alumni.hku.hk/dreamcatchers/\"> recently told more than 1,200 people at a Hong Kong entrepreneurship conference</a> that in the early days of his platform, he pretended to be several different women to chat with new users. It was the only way he could get to 30,000 users in a critical period. \u201cI had no other way because we were only a small company,\u201d said Ma. \u201cSometimes I needed to put on a photo of a lady to make sure we had a hot [online] community.\u201d</p><p>Younger founders have found that media and communications is what they need to educate staff on culture. There are already brilliant engineers in Asia, and what\u2019s needed, say some investors, is a hybridization of roles. Engineers need to learn marketing, and everyone on teams needs to know how to manage the customer and creativity story.</p><p>Pote Supromajakr, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://expara.com/about/team/pote-supromajakr\">a partner in Expara Ventures in Bangkok</a>, says that the firm spends a great deal of time working on creating repeatable models for this kind of education. It\u2019s harder, because a lot of founders and investors want to repeat the Silicon Valley hype-and-invest model.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t work as much here, where even the established players are still doing vanguard business work to break open and establish dominance in Asia\u2019s emerging market ecosystem, locally and regionally.</p><p>\u201cMarketing for awareness and brand equity is considered less important to direct acquisition of customers,\u201d says Supromajakr. \u201cGiven that they have finite \u2018external\u2019 resources, most of the resources should be focused on the most cost-effective ways to attract early-adopters and the core customer base. There are many different acquisition strategies that are somewhat less-obvious and has worked well but it varies subjectively depending on the nature of the business.\u201d</p><p>Supromajakr says building strong data models that come from testing a workable product is actually the way forward, something that Western investors often miss. Most buyers and investors in Asia want to see numbers first, not a marketing narrative. \u201cToo many pitches with a strong focus on \u2018would be\u2019 and \u2018will be\u2019 doesn\u2019t get the attention of anyone,\u201d says Supromajakr.</p><p>That happens with strong partnering between local partners and established technology infrastructure leaders, a practice that may be easier right now in Singapore and Hong Kong, two rivals for the mantle of Asia\u2019s Startup City.</p><p>One of the first tech centers to drive that practice is Cyberport in Hong Kong, which has been making a drive to lure Silicon Valley accelerators and investors to Hong Kong to check out the scene, which is booming.</p><p>After laying claim to much of Hong Kong\u2019s tech infrastructure innovation, its management team is now focusing on media, global road shows and blogging to tell its story, with investments in local operators like Casey Lau, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.startupshk.com/\">who co-manages StartupsHK</a>.</p><p>David Chung, Cyberport CTO, has been working on this mission since the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, often unrecognized as most of the world paid attention to San Francisco and Palo Alto.

Soon, Yik Yak was causing trouble in schools, leading to vicious bullying that some students equated to, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/07/tech/yik-yak-app-high-school-problems/\">according to an article by CNN</a>, \u201ca virtual bathroom wall where users post vitriol and hate.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d say it was far worse than that, with posts that, for example, actually saw some students bullying a girl <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9457339\"><em>for getting raped</em></a>.

And then there were the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-school-lockdown-hoaxes-20140306,0,7164231.story\">anonymous bomb threats</a>, which saw schools going on lockdown.</p><p>The company began to realize the severity of the problem as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/03/11/yik-yak-banned-as-schools-grapple-with-toxic-anonymous-social-chat\">the app was banned at a number schools</a>, and even became the subject of police investigations.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-972240\" alt=\"yikyak-bomb-threats\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/yikyak-bomb-threats.png?w=680&amp;h=398\" width=\"680\" height=\"398\"></p><p>\u201cIn a small handful of cases \u2013 probably three or four \u2013 we dealt with local authorities in terms of threats that have been issued on Yik Yak\u2026A few of them actually resulted in arrests,\u201d Buffington tells us. \u201cAnonymity is a great thing \u2013 the whole reason why we made it is because when you\u2019re anonymous, no one can judge you. But you can\u2019t yell \u2018fire\u2019 in a crowded theater. There\u2019s a line to be drawn,\u201d he says.</p><p>Buffington claims the company hadn\u2019t been keeping exact track of how many times Yik Yak was referenced in terms of being the cause of bullying, threats or other complaints. But the startup was well aware of the general problem, if caught a little off-guard. \u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t expect it to take off on high school campuses like it has,\u201d he says, noting that the app already had a 17-plus rating on the App Store, so parents could easily block it on kids\u2019 phones.</p><p>But user ratings are not enough, says Anna Mendez, Executive Director at the\u00a0National Association of People Against Bullying, explaining that Apple\u2019s system requires parental involvement, and is difficult to use. Her organization reached out to Yik Yak following the bomb threat at\u00a0San Clemente High School, asking the company\u00a0to disable the app at middle and high schools, where anonymous applications are likely to be abused.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-972247\" alt=\"Yik-Yak-app\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/yik-yak-app.jpg?w=650&amp;h=433\" width=\"650\" height=\"433\"></p><p>\u201cCertain things should always be kept out of children\u2019s hands,\u201d Mendez tells TechCrunch. \u201cKids are at a different developmental level than adults. Physically, the frontal lobes of their brains aren\u2019t fully developed. That\u2019s the part of their brain that helps them recognize future consequences from current actions. At the same time, their hormone levels are escalating. Middle school and high school are some of the toughest years where kids begin having self doubts and bullying starts becoming more violent,\u201d she says.</p><p>Yik Yak, she adds, became \u201ca weapon for them to use freely, a huge platform for horrific bullying and serious threats that we as an adult community need to get control of for everyone\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>For a number of startups, rapid user growth within a young demographic would be considered a great problem to have. After all, Yik Yak was swiftly climbing up the App Store charts, where it was ranked No. 63 overall in free applications, and No. 12 in social as of yesterday. (Today, it\u2019s No. 98 and No. 13, respectively.)</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-972261\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-03-13 at 3.53.20 PM\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-13-at-3-53-20-pm.png?w=680&amp;h=450\" width=\"680\" height=\"450\"></p><p>But Yik Yak didn\u2019t want its community to turn into another Ask.fm, where kids bullied each other to such levels that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/12/in-wake-of-teen-suicides-ask-fm-faces-a-myspace-problem/\">many students even took their own life</a>. (More cynically, one could also point out that being associated with such a community would be a big risk in terms of growing its company \u2013 outside investors could be hesitant to fund Yik Yak if it became known as the \u201cmost popular\u201d mobile bullying platform, and the subject of school bans.)</p><p>So the team at Yik Yak came up with a technological, and rather creative, solution: block younger students from using the application by way of geo-fencing. Initially, these were handled on a one-off basis, as was the case in Chicago, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9457339\">where the app was blocked at area schools</a>.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-972239\" alt=\"yikyak-chicago-ban\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/yikyak-chicago-ban.png?w=680&amp;h=393\" width=\"680\" height=\"393\"></p><p>Yik Yak applied geo-fences around middle schools and high schools using their GPS coordinates, which would actually prevent the app from working while students were on school grounds. Of course, students could still use the app at home and elsewhere outside of school, but it puts an immediate damper on all the so-called \u201cfun.\u201d</p><p>To implement these same sorts of bans nationwide, the team approached third-party data provider <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.maponics.com/\">Maponics</a> in order to license GPS data for a total of 100,599 public schools across the U.S. as well as 28,111 private schools.</p><p>\u201cThey have 85 percent of the GPS coordinates for American high schools and middle schools,\u201d says Buffington. \u201cThe message [to students where the app is blocked] is something along the lines of, \u2018it looks like you\u2019re trying to use Yik Yak on a middle school or high school grounds. Yik Yak is intended for people college-aged and above. The app is disabled in this area.'\u201d</p><p>Maponics tells us this is the first time their data has ever been used to help a company exclude traffic across such a wide scope. Typically, their GPS data is used for targeting purposes, not blocking.</p><p>As of early this morning, Yik Yak has applied the Maponics-based geo-fences across the U.S., and says that now the app is inaccessible on a large majority of U.S. high school and middle school campuses.\u00a0\u201cIf for some reason the app is still accessible on a school\u2019s grounds, all they need do is email us at\u00a0yikyakapp@gmail.com\u00a0and we\u2019ll look into it ASAP,\u201d notes\u00a0Buffington.</p><p>As for how the blocks will affect Yik Yak\u2019s user growth, the company isn\u2019t concerned, saying that the app is still doing \u201cvery well\u201d at colleges and the publicly cited user numbers have been grossly under-reported. (When TechCrunch <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/yik-yak-is-an-anonymous-messaging-app-aimed-at-college-campuses/\">first covered Yik Yak</a> in February, the app had 100,000 monthly actives, for reference\u2019s sake.)</p><p>At the end of the day, the company says the goal is making a sustainable product. \u201cWe want to make sure that, two years down the line, Yik Yak is what you use when you\u2019re in a new location \u2013 it\u2019s what you pull up to see what\u2019s going on around you,\u201d says Buffington.</p><p>Though it\u2019s fair to say that Yik Yak should have considered the ramifications of releasing an anonymous, social application into the wild in a post-Ask.fm era, it\u2019s also good to see they\u2019ve fairly quickly addressed the problem, even if it cuts off the second-largest group of users on its service. (College students are the largest, of course).</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-972251\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-03-13 at 3.41.28 PM\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-13-at-3-41-28-pm.png?w=680&amp;h=401\" width=\"680\" height=\"401\"></p><p>\u201cMost [startups] are concerned about <em>grow, grow, grow, grow</em>.

We didn\u2019t create Yik Yak so that people could target other individuals,\u201d says Buffington.</p><p>Now it\u2019s time to see how addicted, or fickle, Yik Yak\u2019s newly blocked students are, and whether or not they\u2019ll turn to the next soon-to-be launched anonymous social application to fill the void.</p><p><em>Image credits: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fox10tv.com/2014/02/21/second-arrest-in-yik-yak-investigation/\">Fox10tv</a>; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9457339\">ABC (WLS-TV)</a>; Yik Yak</em></p>", "title": ["Amid Bullying & Threats Of Violence, Anonymous Social App Yik Yak Shuts Off Access To U.S. Middle & High School Students"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

{"date": ["2015-06-28"], "text": "<p></p><p>Geographic saturation is the key to network effects and profitability in the ridesharing business.</p><p>The more drivers\u00a0Uber\u00a0or Lyft have in a given region, the faster the pick-up times, the better the customer experience and the more rider demand \u2014 which in turn allows drivers to earn more money and attracts more drivers to the network.</p><p>David Sacks best illustrated\u00a0Uber\u2019s positive feedback cycle last year:</p><p>If Sacks is right, that the ridesharing provider with the most geographic saturation ends up with the lowest costs and best rider experience, then the strategy is clear: Raise as much money as possible to subsidize both supply and demand in what, to some observers, appears to be a\u00a0winner-take-all market.</p><p>But do\u00a0Uber\u2019s network effects really scale infinitely, or\u00a0will\u00a0they reach a point of decreasing marginal returns? Could Lyft achieve parity in pickup wait times and driver downtime with only a fraction of\u00a0Uber\u2019s scale?</p><p>Let\u2019s imagine that\u00a0Uber\u00a0achieves a geographic saturation advantage of 10 or even 100 times more drivers in a given area than Lyft (realistically this is unlikely, given the ease with which drivers can work for both services simultaneously). But even if Lyft did concede such an enormous advantage, one could envision the ridesharing market expanding to the point where they get a driver to pick you up within three minutes every time.</p><p>What\u2019s the difference between getting picked up in one minute and three minutes? Not much.</p><p>If Lyft can hit that target, they\u00a0will\u00a0have negated\u00a0Uber\u2019s route-density advantage, and with it, a major premise of the financing arms race. At that point, we would expect Lyft to steadily gain market share as the two companies\u2019 core value propositions become even less differentiated.</p><p>What do these decreasing marginal returns to route density mean for\u00a0Uber\u2019s strategy? Is there some other valuable market where it\u2019s unprecedented route density might be valuable?</p><p>Yes. The same economies of scale apply in the last-mile logistics business, where FedEx, UPS and USPS have managed to achieve supreme geographic saturation. Because these companies have drivers on almost every block in America on a daily basis, their marginal cost to deliver one more parcel is as low as $1.50. And if they have two parcels to deliver to the same house, the cost to deliver the second one falls to almost zero.</p><p>This overwhelming route density has made it nearly impossible for new entrants to gain a foothold in the parcel business. Even DHL, which has a top-three worldwide parcel delivery network, failed in its bid to enter the domestic market, withdrawing in late 2008.</p><p>But\u00a0Uber\u00a0has a key advantage over even these massive incumbents: While the big parcel players put a driver on every block every day, in metropolitan regions\u00a0Uber\u00a0has drivers on every block every minute.</p><p>While both FedEx and UPS do offer scheduled pickups, only\u00a0Uber\u00a0(and perhaps someday Lyft) has the density needed to offer instant pickups and on-demand deliveries. This is a game-changer, as it enables a whole new generation of real-time e-commerce experiences.</p><p>Already customers of\u00a0Uber\u00a0Pool have shown a willingness to ride with a stranger in exchange for a discount. Surely they would make the same trade to allow the driver to stop to let a customer put a\u00a0package\u00a0in the car\u2019s trunk. And if the driver stopped to deliver a\u00a0package, it also wouldn\u2019t feel much different from the current\u00a0Uber\u00a0Pool experience.</p><p>Likely the same driver wouldn\u2019t need to pick up and then deliver the parcel as with courier services like Postmates. Rather the driver would simply accumulate packages in the trunk throughout the day, then drop them all off at a consolidation center at the end of their shift.</p><p>Uber\u00a0has already begun their shift toward becoming a real-time logistics network, rather than a mere ridesharing service. They\u2019ve launched\u00a0Uber\u00a0Cargo in Hong Kong and\u00a0Uber\u00a0Rush in New York City. For the time being, those services use separate networks of cargo vans and bike messengers, respectively. But it\u2019s only a matter of time before we see\u00a0Uber\u00a0roll out parcel solutions that leverage their dense network of ridesharing drivers.</p><p>The first order analysis of why this matters is obvious: Logistics is 12 percent of global GDP, so the parcel business represents a huge new revenue stream for\u00a0Uber. The second order analysis is perhaps more interesting: Parcels and people can cross subsidize each other, so by co-existing, the two services are cheaper than either could be alone.</p><p>Parcel delivery services\u00a0will\u00a0become a powerful lever for\u00a0Uber\u00a0in its rivalry with Lyft. Suddenly Uber\u00a0changing its tagline from \u201cEveryone\u2019s private driver\u201d to \u201cWhere lifestyle meets logistics\u201d makes a lot more sense. Pulling off that change all the way back in 2013 shows that\u00a0Uber\u00a0has one of the most forward-looking management teams in business.</p>", "title": ["Why Your Next Package Will Be Delivered By An Uber"], "author": ["Ryan Petersen"]},

Well, sort of:</p><p>And I was impressed by a couple of the hackathon projects:</p><p>(Note, however, that I forgot to include the word \u201csoftware\u201d there.)</p><p>But to my mind, the consumer-software gold rush that began five years ago, when Apple unveiled the iPhone 3G and its App Store, hit the point of diminishing returns some time ago. It\u2019s time to look for new forbidding mountains. Which mostly means it\u2019s time to look at hardware.</p><p>That\u2019s how it always works. Hardware engineers are the explorers, opening up new territory like ubiquitous broadband and/or smartphones and/or cloud-scale data centers, and software engineers are the prospectors who flood into these new lands and stake and mine their claims. Individuals move faster than organizations, which may explain why enterprise software has gone from boring to thrilling over the last couple of years, just as the consumer wave crested and waned:</p><p>But if you want to see what happens <i>next</i>, look at the hardware. (Stipulating that a line between \u201chardware\u201d and \u201csoftware\u201d is at best a crude approximation as basically all hardware projects involve a lot of custom software, too.)</p><p>Everything that excited me at Disrupt was hardware: <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/11/estimote-wins-best-hardware-startup-at-techcrunch-disrupt-sf/\">Estimote</a> and its evil sibling <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/09/paypal-debuts-its-newest-hardware-beacon-a-bluetooth-le-enabled-device-for-hands-free-check-ins-and-payments/\">PayPal Beacon</a>; the new <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/03/extremefliers-releases-a-teeny-tiny-quadcopter-that-can-flip-in-mid-air/\">Micro Drone</a>; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fabulonia.com/\">Fabulonia</a>, which offers secure DRM-free 3D printing via a printer-top box; <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/10/soil-iq/\">Soil IQ</a>: and of course <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/09/cota-by-ossia-wireless-power/\">Cota by Ossia</a>, albeit with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.appliedplatonics.com/about/\">friends</a>\u2018 caveats:</p><p>I suppose my fundamental complaint is that, in stark contrast to these hardware companies, almost all of the software companies exhibiting at Disrupt seemed to me to be built for today, or even yesterday, rather than tomorrow.</p><p>We\u2019re heading into a future of drones and sensors. That is not a particularly insightful comment; it\u2019s seemed painfully obvious to many people for some time now. Cota was pitched as a phone recharger, but I bet it\u2019ll wind up being more useful for recharging wireless sensors, which \u2014 prediction alert! \u2014 I suspect will outnumber phones within the next decade. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/05/matternet-enter-the-dronenet/\">Drones</a> of all sizes are already practically <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2ThTb6iffA\">everywhere</a>.</p><p>So where is the software being built for that future? Why still so much connection, collaboration and even, God help us, photo-sharing? True, there was a panel on Bitcoin, which is genuinely innovative and disruptive software;</p><p>yes, there\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.airware.com/about-us/\">Airware</a>; but right now those feel like exceptions proving the rule.</p><p>Okay, so we have to wait for the hardware folks to start opening up the new territory. But in the interim it feels like not much is happening. My own degree is actually in hardware (electrical engineering), but I abandoned it almost immediately upon acquisition in order to become a software prospector. For the first time ever I find myself faintly regretting that. Maybe I am just jaded and cranky; or maybe software has now eaten enough of the world that the process is becoming less disruptive, less interesting, and more tedious status quo. I hope not. Bring on the drones and sensors.</p><p><i>Image credit:</i> Yawn, Phoebe, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/85597613@N08/7894694720/\">Flickr</a>.</p>", "title": ["Wait, When Did Software Become So Boring?"], "author": ["Jon Evans"]},

{"date": ["2012-07-24"], "text": "<p>Earlier today, news broke that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://craigslist.org\">Craigslist</a> has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gigaom.com/2012/07/24/craigslist-sues-competitor-padmapper-over-listings/\">taken legal action</a> against PadMapper and Craigslist API creator 3Taps \u2014 after an <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/22/padmapper-craigslist-cease-and-desist/\">ongoing disagreement</a> over the scraping of Craigslist data to use in a third-party service (3Taps <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/09/padmapper-gets-craigslist-postings-again-without-craigslists-help/\">became PadMapper\u2019s partner</a> for data acquisition after PadMapper got the initial C&amp;D). We\u2019ve also found out that at least one other developer has been getting cease &amp; desist correspondence from the listings giant. The move shows that Craigslist is making a much stronger and wider effort to ensure that its data stays on its own site, and goes nowhere else.</p><p>Jeff Kastner, a website developer based in Missouri, tells TechCrunch that Craigslist issued him a similar order to stop using its data. The order was not just for a Craigslist-based site he had developed (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vending-machinez.info/\">www.vending-machinez.info</a>, which now goes to a holding page but had sold, you guessed it, vending machine products); but also for a post on his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jeffkastner.com/\">own blog</a>, where he\u00a0advertised the sale of a pre-populated Classifieds Website (which had nothing to do with Craigslist data). <del datetime=\"2012-07-25T19:29:59+00:00\">We have the letter from Craigslist embedded below.</del> Update: we\u2019ve been requested to remove the letter, which we have done.</p><p>Kastner\u2019s story underscores just how much money there can be made from using Craigslist data \u2014 perhaps one of the reasons why Craigslist does not like these sites. He says that while his site was not nearly as popular as PadMapper, it had still brought in over its lifetime $24,000 in AdSense revenues, \u201cdespite the fact that I also redirected all traffic back to their site.\u201d</p><p>Kastner says that when he wrote to Craigslist for clarification, especially on the post on his own site, he never got a response. In any case, the lawyers for Craigslist threatened legal action totaling $25,000 per day, so he\u2019s taken down both offending items \u2014 vending machine website and post on his own blog. Craigslist also stipulated that he cannot write about this incident on his own website. That\u2019s why Kastner came to TechCrunch.</p><p>We\u2019ve contacted Craigslist to see if they can explain whether there are others getting similar letters, and will update this post when they respond.</p><p>But there may be at least one more on the list: One popular Chrome plugin, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/ziinkext/craigslist-helper\">Ziink\u2019s Craigslist helper</a>, which was aimed at making \u201cCraigslist easier and more productive. It makes finding the ads you are searching for easier,\u201d\u00a0has deactivated its web browser plugins (they had existed for Chrome, Firefox and Safari). We\u2019ve reached out to Ziink to get more details, too.\u00a0<strong>Update:</strong>\u00a0Ziink has confirmed that he, too, was contacted by Craigslist\u2019s legal people to cease and desist.</p><p>To be clear, just as PadMapper did, Kastner\u2019s script referred everyone back to Craigslist. And like the others, the whole purpose was to improve the browsing experience with the main site, which can be wickedly hard to navigate. \u201cI was definitely sending a lot of traffic their way as people wouldn\u2019t find my sites unless they were using the search engines to search for Craigslist items,\u201d he notes.</p><p>\u201cWhat I find almost funny is that they\u2019re going after people in this manner,\u201d Kastner adds. \u201cThere are million dollar businesses\u201d \u2014 he cites <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wprobot.net/\">WP Robot</a> as one example \u2014 that automate the process of scraping and sell to everyone.\u201d Will Craigslist be approaching them all?</p><p>There are other data scrapers out there, and some might not be so compliant as Kastner has. \u201cForcing the average scraper to shut down, what they do will in most cases just make them release their scripts to the public (be it blackhat forums or whatever) anonymously,\u201d he says. The way of the world in today\u2019s climate of hacktivism, I guess.</p><p>He notes that \u201cThe easy solution would be to make scraping impossible, as Amazon does on its pages.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s what Craigslist has planned next.</p>", "title": ["PadMapper\u2019s Not The Only One With Legal Heat From Craigslist: Others Getting C&D\u2019s, Too [Updated]"], "author": ["Ingrid Lunden"]},
{"date": ["2011-06-28"], "text": "<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-318740\" title=\"ed\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/ed.jpg?w=300&amp;h=67\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"67\">When you visit Craigslist, it\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re visiting the early 90s web. Blue links. That\u2019s it. On one hand, you have to appreciate the simplicity (and speed). On the other, WTF? It\u2019s 2011.</p><p>Many\u00a0competitors\u00a0have tried to disrupt Craigslist in the past, and failed \u2014 often miserably. But there\u2019s reason to believe the space is ripe for disruption now thanks to one key ingredient: mobile. That\u2019s exactly what <a href=\"http://www.eggcartel.com/\">EggCartel</a> is aiming to do.</p><p>Their first product, EggDrop launches today on the iPhone and\u00a0tomorrow\u00a0on Android devices. Think of it as a way to put a version of Craigslist in your pocket, but one that\u2019s much more visual. And even more focused on location. And most importantly, one that\u2019s much easier to add items to.</p><p>That\u2019s really the key to EggDrop. Adding items is as easy as taking one picture with your phone, setting a price, and uploading. You can add a title and other details, but EggDrop does the rest to categorize your product on the backend. From there, it\u2019s listed in a location-based directory accessible by the apps. Users look for items they\u2019re interested in and can watch them to see how the price\u00a0fluctuates, or can put down a bid right away. It\u2019s Dutch auction-style, so the price goes down over time if no one bids.</p><p>Location plays a huge role in EggDrop because there is no shipping allowed. Every item sold and bought must be done so locally. So if you see a bike for sale, you know that it\u2019s relatively close to you, and you have to go pick it up (or have the seller drop it off). \u201cLocation isn\u2019t just about where you live or work, it\u2019s where you are at any given time. Maybe a <em>Star Wars</em>\u00a0action figure isn\u2019t available in your neighborhood \u2014 but you go to LA and there it is,\u201d co-founder Dan Zheng says.</p><p>With this human interaction in mind, EggDrop is also doing something a bit old school \u2014 they\u2019re leaving it up to the buyers and sellers to handle the transactions. That\u2019s right, there is no fancy payment system within the app. When you buy something, you do it with cash, check, PayPal, or credit card (if the seller has something like Square). They\u2019re thinking about partnerships in the future to handle payments within the app.</p><p>So how do they avoid spam and fraud? A rating system is key to EggDrop. Once you buy and/or sell an item, you give feedback on that experience. If a person is marked as being a flake (they said they\u2019d buy but never showed up) or as selling lemons, that rating stays with them. Just like eBay, the goal is to have a robust reputation system largely maintained by the users, that they can trust.</p><p>We first covered EggCartel when they launched as one of the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/10/angelpad-demo-day/\">initial AngelPad companies</a> late last year. Since then, they\u2019ve been in private alpha testing with under 100 people. But the founders note that things have been going really well, and now they feel confident enough to open it up to all U.S. users. At the same time, they realize that things may be a bit slow in the beginning due to a lack of items listed, so they\u2019ve created a wish list feature. If there\u2019s something you\u2019re looking for that isn\u2019t listed yet, you can add it to your list and get alerted when such an item becomes available near you.</p><p>Zheng and co-founder Brian Lynch expect that most people will use EggDrop to sell electronics, furniture, kids items, and things of that nature at first. But they note that already on their website in limited testing, they\u2019ve sold a couple of cars.</p><p>In terms of monetization, EggCartel doesn\u2019t do the obvious thing in taking a cut of sales (because again, they\u2019re not involved in the actual sales), instead they\u2019re going to focus on adding premium features over time. But all that is in the future. For now, they just want to get users.</p><p>To that end, EggCartel is offering TechCrunch readers a $5 gift (in the form of either an Amazon gift card, iTunes gift card, or donation to the Red Cross) if you list 5 items by noon PT on Friday. To claim this gift, simply email techcrunch@eggcartel.com from within the app (Account =&gt; selling =&gt; promote =&gt; email) when you hit your 5 items listed.</p><p>The seven person team also has one other bit of exciting news today: funding. EggCartel has just closed a $1 million seed round led by SV Angel and BlueRun Ventures. Trinity Ventures and Charles River Ventures participated as well.</p><p>You can find EggDrop in the App Store <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eggdrop-your-neighborhood/id442784113?mt=8\">here</a>. Look for it tomorrow in the Android Market.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-318741\" title=\"1\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/11.png?w=300&amp;h=450\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\">\u00a0<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-318742\" title=\"ec\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/ec.png?w=300&amp;h=450\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\"></p>", "title": ["EggCartel Makes Craigslist Look Even Older With The Fast, Mobile EggDrop (And Funding)"], "author": ["MG Siegler"]},

{"date": ["2012-03-20"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.eggdropapp.com/\">EggDrop</a>, essentially a mobile app alternative to Craigslist, is starting to pick up steam. The company now boasts half a million downloads of its app on iOS and Android, with $8 million in listings from across the 50 U.S. states and the U.K. (EggDrop\u2019s top two markets).</p><p>The app <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/28/eggcartel-eggdrop/\">originally launched last June</a>, backed by $1 million in funding in a round led by BlueRun Ventures and SV Angel. But that first experience doesn\u2019t look much like EggDrop today. In November, the company rolled out a major update (ver. 2.0) which completely replaced the auction format found in the original with more traditional marketplace-style listings. Since then, over 5,000 items have been sold within the app, including electronics, games, furniture, and even grand pianos and wedding dresses.</p><p>With <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/28/eggcartel-eggdrop/\">the first version of EggDrop</a>, the idea was to introduce a somewhat unique pricing model \u2013 the \u201cfalling price\u201d auction. Instead of setting a price for an item, the seller would enter both a minimum and maximum price. Over 72 hours, the price would gradually fall if there were no takers.</p><p>As it turned out, that system didn\u2019t prove to be a hit with users.</p><p>\u201cSellers tend to be very protective of their minimum price,\u201d explains co-founder Dan Zheng as to why the original model didn\u2019t really take off. \u201cWhen people put down the price range they always think back to what they paid for it, rather than what the fair market value is.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eggdrop-android.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-522981\" title=\"EggDrop-android\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/eggdrop-android.jpg?w=162&amp;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"162\" height=\"300\"></a>Now, sellers just create a normal listing with whatever price they want, and leave it up indefinitely, if they choose. In fact, the setting to automatically re-list the item after 7 days is switched on by default, so, unlike with Craigslist, sellers don\u2019t have to continually return to create a new posting. However, if the item is of a time-sensitive nature \u2013 like concert tickets, for example \u2013 users can configure the item to expire.</p><p>Currently, EggDrop is proving popular in major metro areas in the U.S., starting with L.A. and followed by (in order) New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta, Miami, Dallas, D.C., Detroit and Denver. Outside the U.S., there\u2019s been some adoption in London, Manchester and Birmingham, U.K. and even a bit of uptake in other regions like Australia, Canada, Argentina and Spain. This, despite the fact that the company hasn\u2019t made any efforts at localization, only a bit of translation work to support Spanish.</p><p>Zheng doesn\u2019t have exact numbers on how much of the user base are in these top U.S. metro areas, but if he had to guess, it would be over half the app\u2019s users. He also notes that roughly a quarter of the users (25%-30%) are either moms or students, looking to clean out closets or save a few extra dollars.</p><p>Interestingly, one of EggDrop\u2019s key selling points \u2013 its ability to cross-post listings to Craigslist \u2013 hasn\u2019t had a major impact on the app\u2019s adoption. It\u2019s a very small percentage of users that discover the app that way, something in the \u201csingle digits,\u201d says Zheng. Instead, users are finding the app through old-fashioned means: word-of-mouth, app store searches, and, for a week earlier this year, through a \u201cfeatured\u201d listing on the Google <del>Android Market</del>\u2026Google Play store.</p><p>While all the above numbers refer to organic listings created by EggDrop users, at any given time, 5% of the listings are from external, third-party sources, namely Craigslist. Zheng says the team is careful not to include too many of these.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty mindful of the balance between organic listings and third-party listings\u00a0because\u00a0the experience is slightly different. I really don\u2019t want to confuse users,\u201d he says.</p><p>Over the past few weeks, the company has added a couple of notable features to the app: a built-in anonymous messaging feature that allows buyers and sellers to communicate in real-time without having to share mobile phone numbers, as well as a new section for \u201cWanted\u201d listings. With the latter, the idea is that EggDrop will be able to match buyers and sellers based on description, price and location.</p><p>While originally, the company looked like a modernized take on what Craigslist could be if built in the mobile era, recent events have put the app in closer competition with other newcomers like <a href=\"http://www.zaarly.com/\">Zaarly</a>, for example. Up until earlier this month, one of Zaarly\u2019s biggest\u00a0differentiating\u00a0features (besides its primary focus on tasks, not goods), was the anonymity of its users. But Zaarly\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/08/zaarly-20/\">revamped reputation system</a> now lets buyers and sellers know exactly who each other are.

{"date": ["2015-05-31"], "text": "<p></p><p>I\u2019m ashamed because I felt the need to brag to my 13-year-old. But she asked for it.\u00a0My daughter Mollie had a homework assignment for her guidance class that had her ask me what I do for a living. This put me in a weird position. I do a lot of things. I didn\u2019t know how to tell her.</p><p>But it also shows that school is too focused on \u201ceducation leads to a job.\u201d\u00a0This is not true anymore.</p><p>The reality is the average person has 14 different careers in their lives and the average multi-millionaire has seven different sources of income.\u00a0So anything that is \u201cone-job focused\u201d will create a generation of kids that will learn the hard way that life doesn\u2019t work like that.</p><p>The world changes fast. The jobs I do now didn\u2019t exist when I was 13. And the jobs she will do don\u2019t exist now.\u00a0So learning how to learn is more important than memorizing facts.</p><p>Here\u2019s how the assignment went:</p><p>I don\u2019t have a single occupation. And\u00a0you can drop out of school right now and do what I do.\u00a0In fact, Mollie, I hope you drop out of school right now. Please?</p><p>I\u2019m a firm believer that people feel more well-being in their life when they are around people they love, they are good at what they do, and they have some autonomy (freedom) in how they make decisions.</p><p>You get more freedom in your life by doing many different things.\u00a0Some of which make money, some don\u2019t, but all increase your competence, relationships and freedom: the three musketeers of well-being.</p><p>So I am a writer (I write books and articles). I\u2019m a podcaster (I\u2019ve had 10 million downloads of my podcast). I speak occasionally. And I advise or invest in over 30 different companies.</p><p>And I screw up a lot. If you do a lot of things, you screw up a lot of things. You have to give yourself permission to totally humiliate yourself repeatedly. If you can do that, then happiness results.</p><p>With companies I advise I try to stick to one criteria: can this company help over a billion people\u00a0[<em>I think I exaggerated here. Pathetically bragging to a 13-year-old. Maybe a million people is more accurate. Or, heck, a hundred people.</em>]</p><p>And remember, there are <em>zero</em>\u00a0formal education requirements for what I do.</p><p>I am really happy with the friends I\u2019ve made in the past five years. Also, I learn a lot. Probably a day has not gone by where I haven\u2019t learned a huge amount.</p><p>The thing I dislike is that sometimes I don\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d enough (even though I wrote the book \u201cThe Power of No.\u201d)\u00a0Here is the secret: If something is not a \u201chell yes!\u201d then you should say \u201cno.\u201d</p><p>But even though this is a good technique, it is sometimes hard to follow and you end up saying \u201cyes\u201d because you want people to like you and you end up having less time to do the things that make you creative and give you life and energy.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to solve that. Practice.</p><p>I have no work hours. Neither will you. You have school hours now but those are fake work hours.</p><p>BUT.</p><p>Daily routine is very important. We are at different levels of energy and productivity throughout the day.\u00a0For instance, at an extreme example, late at night we tend to be tired (that is why we sleep).\u00a0So if you try to do important work at night, it might not come out good.</p><p>We are at our peak productivity in our brain from two to four hours after we are awake.</p><p>So if you\u00a0wake up at 5 a.m., from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. your brain is about 100 times more active than it is at night.\u00a0So I wake up at 5 a.m. I read for two hours. Then I write for two hours because this is the activity that is most important to me.</p><p>Then I walk or exercise and then start to do things that require less and less brain power. Like advising businesses (I will do that first) and then do things like running errands or things that don\u2019t require as much energy.</p><p>Our brain is only 2 percent of our body mass but burns 25 percent of our calories every day.\u00a0So how you make use of this magnificent tool that you\u00a0have is very important for how well your day turns out.</p><p>I don\u2019t have an occupation.</p><p>But then I got desperate and scared.\u00a0I started building businesses when I was in my 20s because I needed to make some money.</p><p>When your sister was born it was like this new U.S. citizen moved into my house and she was one foot tall, didn\u2019t speak English, couldn\u2019t walk, shat all over the floor, and cried all the time, and I had to take care of her.\u00a0So I felt I needed to make money to do that.</p><p>Sometimes I was good at it and sometimes I was incredibly stressed out and bad at it. Sometimes I wanted to run away.\u00a0But I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t. Because now both that little one-foot-tall person and you are now in my life.</p><p>I\u2019ve built over 20 businesses and maybe 17 of them have failed and three have done well.\u00a0But I\u2019ve also loved writing and creating since I was a little kid. I\u2019ve written every single day for almost the past 25 years.</p><p>Because I know a lot of people and write about a lot of people, I\u2019ve also started doing a \u201cradio show\u201d (podcast) where I interview people. I\u2019ve interviewed entrepreneurs (Mark Cuban, Arianna Huffington), entertainers (Coolio, Amanda Palmer), many authors, many athletes, and all people who have tried to make their lives better.</p><p>I interview them because I want to learn from them and share their stories with my listeners. I try to be a good interviewer but it\u2019s hard. I try to practice.</p><p>For every 10\u00a0people who\u00a0like you, at least one or two people hate\u00a0you and they are the ones who reach out and contact you. So the better you do, the more you hear from people who hate you. So you have to give yourself permission to do things that a lot of people hate.</p><p>And I like helping businesses because often we are solving problems very important to many people.</p><p>I chose to do these things because I love them and I also love the impact they have on people. It was very hard for me to figure out all the things I want to do and it often changes.\u00a0When you have impact on people, money is a byproduct. You get better and better at how to make that byproduct when you mine for value.</p><p>Every six months I end up doing different things. I have no idea what I will be doing for a living six months from now. Nobody does.\u00a0Nothing in life is predictable. You can say, \u201cI will do X\u201d but then in a year you will end up doing Y and that\u2019s fine.</p><p>Being unpredictable is more normal than being predictable. Humans were made to be nomads, to be in different environments, to roam the world, and we evolved to adapt quickly to new experiences.</p><p>So what new experiences we all adapt to six months from now is unknown. But I hope and think I will still love what I do and still help people and still be creative in everything I do.</p><p>Whenever you are curious, ask questions.</p><p>If you feel a question is stupid then <em>definitely</em>\u00a0ask that question. If you are shy about asking a question, then ask two\u00a0questions.</p><p>Your mom\u00a0has a good trick for this. Whenever she is at a conference and it\u2019s question time, she raises her hand fast before she even knows what question she wants to ask.\u00a0Then she has to figure out a question to ask.</p><p>Otherwise you stay in a tight line with everyone else. You have to step out of the line to see how the entire formation works.</p><p>Curiosity will fuel this giant engine we call our brain. It will help you learn things that nobody else knows.\u00a0It will help you figure out what you want to do and be and what problems you want to solve faster than all the people who are too afraid to ask questions.</p><p>The next thing is: always be healthy. You can\u2019t be creative if you are sick. Every seven years your body is made up of 100 percent new cells and the old cells die.</p><p>Where do the cells come from? Mostly from the food you eat. Eat junk and you are junk. Eat well and you are well.</p><p>Also remember this saying: \u201cYou are the average of the five people you surround yourself with.\u201d If you surround yourself with good, creative, smart people then you will be a good, creative, smart person.\u00a0These are like your \u201cemotional cells.\u201d They change 100 percent every six months.</p><p>Every day remember to be creative, even a little bit. Write, or read, or draw, or write down 10\u00a0ideas.\u00a0This builds your \u201ccreative cells.\u201d\u00a0Note that my biology skills are off the chain.</p><p>Finally, remember that every day is the only day we have to work with. Regrets are already dead in the past. And worries about the future are unpredictable.\u00a0So be grateful for the many blessings you have right now. You have a blessed life with an entire world that is your drawing board.\u00a0Paint a beautiful picture on it.</p>", "title": ["Hard-Core Career Advice For A 13-Year-Old"], "author": ["James Altucher"]},

But Zaarly is going beyond just making its platform available to all comers, and helping some of its top sellers create even more compelling marketplaces with the launch of Zaarly Storefronts.</p><p>Through Zaarly Storefronts, selected Zaarly sellers will now have a place to showcase their talents, with customer-facing websites that highlight their products and services to potential customers. Zaarly\u2019s marketplace previously worked by letting users respond to requests for various services.

It\u2019s a pretty high-touch operation, though, and a little different from just rolling out a platform that anyone can post their services to. For instance, Zaarly is sending out professional photographers and helping them build custom webpages that will appeal more to customers.</p><p>At launch, Zaarly will have about 120 featured sellers in San Francisco, with more than 1,000 items available through their storefronts. All items fall under one of its top 10 categories, which range from \u201cBusiness Services\u201d to \u201cWellness &amp; Fitness\u201d to \u201cHome Services &amp; Repairs.\u201d While the initial launch is in San Francisco, Zaarly has also been aggressively on-boarding users in markets like New York and Los Angeles, and will introduce Storefronts in those markets as well.</p><p>While Zaarly started with service providers who have already had some success with its platform, it\u2019s also taking applications for others who wish to create their own Storefronts. The hope is that over time, Zaarly will be able to reduce the amount of hand holding need to roll out each individual page.</p><p>==<br>\n* Other people writing in today\u2019s Web-speak might say \u201ccurated,\u201d but those people are assholes.</p>", "title": ["Local Commerce Platform Zaarly Launches Storefronts To Showcase Its Top Service Providers"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

Update: Intuit has confirmed its purchase of Payvment to TechCrunch, saying \u201cIntuit has acquired a team of highly skilled developers who will be of great value to the social teams at Intuit.\u201d</p><p>This morning,\u00a0a message posted on\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.payvment.com/\">Payvment\u2019s website</a>\u00a0noted\u00a0the team is \u201cjoining a new company,\u201d and the platform will end its operations on February 28th. But we spotted some Payvment employees had switched their LinkedIn profiles to note Intuit as their new home. Sources confirmed the company Payvment hinted at was Intuit, who has bought its technology, talent, and IP. Intuit may make a formal announcement soon.\u00a0It could be a very smart play, as Payvment could help make it easy for Intuit\u2019s small businesses finance suite customers to launch storefronts on social properties like Facebook.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-745771\" alt=\"Intuit\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/intuit.png?w=680&amp;h=418\"></p><p>The news of the Payvment\u2019s acquisition comes\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/24/payvment-christian-taylor/\">following the exit of the CEO, Christian Taylor</a>, who announced his departure this July, saying that he was ready to work on his \u201cnext big startup.\u201d Taylor remained on the company\u2019s board of directors, but the day-to-day operations shifted over to COO Jim Stoneham at the time.</p><p>Stoneham tells us Payvment had just passed 175,000 sellers and was adding new sellers at a rate of 1,500 per week, he said. Its\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/payvment-ads/\">Ad platform</a>, which helped Payvment merchants buy Facebook ads,\u00a0was reportedly doing well, too. That being said, according to AppData, only 20,000 to 30,000 of Payvment\u2019s registered users had been active monthly as of the time of the CEO\u2019s exit\u00a0(source: AppData).\u00a0Intuit could potentially start letting its customers buy Facebook ads for their businesses through Payvment\u2019s technology.</p><p>Payvment, despite growing to hundreds of thousands of merchants, still faced a challenge in that shopping on Facebook \u2013 sometimes casually referred to as \u201cf-commerce\u201d \u2013 is still in its early stages. Users still seem more interested in liking and commenting on items, than actually transacting on Facebook itself.</p><p>That may be why Intuit didn\u2019t want to take over Payvment\u2019s entire business, but instead just wanted the raw materials. So rather than shut down its storefront platform and stranding hundreds of thousands of online merchants, the Palo Alto-based Payvment struck a deal to hand them over to\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ecwid.com/\">Ecwid</a>\u00a0following three years of intense competition with the Russian startup.\u00a0Ecwid, which recently became the Facebook store-builder with\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/251458316228-ecwid\">the most monthly active users</a>\u00a0(100,000+, according to AppData), has an existing community of 250,000 merchants in 174 countries. It offers an e-commerce widget that can be embedded on any website, blog or Facebook page.</p><p>The company also reports growth of its own, noting that during the holiday shopping period (Oct-Dec 2012), total sales from Ecwid-powered stores grew 65 percent from the previous quarter and referral (inbound) links from Facebook to Ecwid stores accounted for 8.5 percent of purchases.</p><p>According to Ecwid CEO\u00a0Ruslan Fazlyev, his service was gaining Facebook users throughout 2012, while Payvment was losing customers. \u201cOn December 2012 we caught up with Payvment and took the lead,\u201d he tells us. At the time, Ecwid was ahead by 10,000 monthly actives. Payvment then contacted Ecwid asking it to participate in an auction to bid for their customer base. \u201cWe participated in this auction with some other undisclosed companies, won, and now we made it possible for Payvment\u2019s customers to not suffer from them closing down the Facebook storefronts,\u201d Fazlyev adds.\u00a0Terms of that deal are not being disclosed, however.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/28/facebook-e-commerce-platform-payvment-shuts-down-merchants-moved-to-ecwid/payvment-mau/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-745520\"><img class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-745520\" alt=\"Payvment-mau\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/payvment-mau.jpg?w=680&amp;h=353\"></a></p><p>We reached Payvment CEO Stoneham for comment.

More senior GREE managers who came over with the OpenFeint acquisition like<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/04/openfeint-gree-resmini/\"> Eros Resmini recently left to pursue other opportunities</a>. It came around a tough earnings quarter for GREE, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://v3.eir-parts.net/EIR/View.aspx?template=ir_material&amp;sid=19539&amp;code=3632\">which saw net profit actually decline year-over-year on the back of a tougher regulatory environment</a> around game mechanics in Japan.</p><p>Dharni said that all of Funzio\u2019s four founders are still working at GREE. (That\u2019s unlike what happened with OpenFeint, which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2011/09/14/gree-ceo-replaces-openfeint-co-founder-jason-citron-as-ceo/\">saw its original CEO Jason Citron leave not long after</a> the acquisition closed to work on other projects.)</p><p>\u201cEven if you look at the attrition rate from the ex-Funzio guys, overall it\u2019s gone really well,\u201d Dharni said. \u201cAll four founders are here and they have pretty significant chunks of responsibility in terms of product.\u201d Some Funzio employees were affected by the recent layoffs however.</p><p>Like many other game developers on the iOS and Android platforms, GREE is trying to prove that it\u2019s not so vulnerable to the hits-driven nature of the business by having a network of users that\u2019s so large that it can cheaply distribute games of its own or of other developers. Yet Apple is notoriously controlling of iOS. Even <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/07/facebooks-dilemma-with-native-ios-apps-relevance-or-revenues/\">Facebook has had to effectively cede</a> <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/30/facebook-mobile-app-ad/\">the growth of its gaming ecosystem\u2019s revenues to Apple</a> as players migrate from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets.</p><p>This will be a huge challenge for GREE\u2019s platform efforts back in Japan. Can they offer something above and beyond what iOS already gives developers in terms of marketing and monetization that would be worth giving up extra revenue share?</p><p>Dharni said, \u201cWe feel like platforms in general on mobile can be more or less a commodity and we are looking to see how we can make ours very unique.\u201d</p><p>That said, the developer-only route isn\u2019t a bad one as iOS has become more lucrative over the past year.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s 4X and beyond in terms of revenue [compared to a year ago],\u201d Dharni said. A major contributor is the emergence of the iPad as a gaming device, something that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/21/supercell/\">other developers like Supercell have said is a huge part of their financial success.</a></p><p>Dharni said that GREE\u2019s Japanese leadership, which have spent years fine-tuning the freemium gaming model back in Japan, helped the U.S. team better understand how to run games as a service.</p><p>\u201cWhile we had been running live games, we weren\u2019t running them at the depth at GREE was,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat that means is creating new fun and engaging content on a daily or weekly basis. You want your players coming back every week to check what\u2019s new. We conceptually understood this, but didn\u2019t see the extent to which it improves our metrics.\u201d</p><p>Android is still lagging iOS on per user monetization, but Dharni said, \u201cWe feel that Android is going to grow faster this year.\u201d</p><p>Facebook, the platform where Funzio started, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/30/facebook-mobile-app-ad/\">may also re-emerge this year as an important way for developers</a> to distribute their work on mobile platforms.</p><p>\u201cOverall, it\u2019s still too early to say but some of the test results that are coming in are pretty good actually,\u201d Dharni said. \u201cThe ROI is definitely there. It will definitely become one of the top channels for user acquisition long-term.\u201d</p>", "title": ["The Top Mobile Games Are Grossing More Than 4X What They Were A Year Ago, GREE\u2019s Dharni Says"], "author": ["Kim-Mai Cutler"]},

And even when you\u2019ve found someone with a satisfactory rating, the descriptions left by other buyers tend to be mostly useless (<em>A++++</em>, anyone?), which makes the whole thing feel a little risky regardless. Oh, and sellers can always get scammed by buyers, which makes it even more fun.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.addoway.com\">Addoway</a> is an e-commerce site that looks to help reduce these feelings of anxiety\u00a0by using Facebook Connect to help you find sellers that your friends have had good experiences dealing with in the past. The site launched eight months ago, and is currently drawing 90,000 uniques a month.</p><p>The premise is simple: when you run a search on Addoway for whatever it is you\u2019re looking to buy (say, an Xbox), the site will let you sort listings by your social connections. If you know someone who has interacted with a certain seller before, then they\u2019ll show up at the top \u2014\u00a0and you can talk to your friends about their experience with that seller if you\u2019re still hesitant.</p><p><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/addowayshot.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Of course, in order for these social connections to be of any use you need to actually <em>know</em> people who are using the site to either buy or sell things. And right now it\u2019s pretty unlikely \u2014\u00a0even if you have a few hundred friends, the odds that one of them is using Addoway to sell the item you\u2019re looking for is very low.</p><p>CEO Fredrick Nijm agrees that it\u2019s unlikely that the social connections will be much help at this point, but he believes that if the site grows in popularity, it will become much more useful. For the nearer-term, Addoway has a back-up plan in place to help make shoppers more comfortable: very transparent seller listings.</p><p>The site invites sellers to link up their blogs, Amazon accounts, eBay seller profiles, and YouTube videos, allowing visitors to quickly get a snapshot of who they are. Granted, reading someone\u2019s blog or watching their videos doesn\u2019t necessarily help you determine if they\u2019re a reputable seller, but this kind of transparency can still potentially help instill a greater sense of trust. Maybe.</p><p>So far the site has over 400,000 listings, most of which have been sucked in from eBay (Addoway lets sellers connect with their eBay, Etsy, and Bonanza accounts). Nijm declined to say how many active sellers the site has, but says that most of them (including those who have linked their eBay accounts) are still active.</p><p>The site makes money by offering a premium account to sellers for $8.95 per month that gives them prominent placement in search results and\u00a0Addoway\u2019s social media presences. In the future the site will also add transaction fees, though existing users will have a window where they won\u2019t have to pay them.</p><p>This is a very difficult market to crack into, especially given how much traction Addoway will need for its social connections to become useful, and Nijm knows it. Still, he says that this is the only service that uses Facebook Connect to help buyers pick out reputable sellers (as opposed to using it for product recommendations, the way Amazon does), and he says that Addoway has seen significant growth over the last several months, going from 60,000 uniques a couple of months ago to 90,000 today.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Mow-s-dofDY?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></span><br>\n</p>", "title": ["Addoway Is Like eBay With A Social Streak"], "author": ["Jason Kincaid"]},

The company, which provides an all-inclusive and free HR management suite, has amassed arrangements with over 10,000 small and mid-sized employers, and its platform covers over 100,000 employees. Zenefits is free to employers because it generates its revenue on the insurance brokerage side of the world, which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/14/zenefits-financials/\">has been pretty lucrative</a> for the company \u2014 <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/10/adp-sues-zenefits-for-defamation-rolls-out-a-competing-service/\">which isn\u2019t making the industry very happy</a>.</p><p>Parker Conrad is the co-founder and current CEO of Zenefits, and has played a prominent role in the company\u2019s aggressive expansion. He brought <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/10/zenefits-david-sacks/\">Yammer Founder David Sacks on as COO</a> of the organization at the end of 2014, and has overseen Zenefits\u2019 growth into the Fortune 500 market with the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/zenefits-launches-zenefits-for-mangers-and-zenefits-business-intelligence/\">launch of two new tools</a> \u2014 Zenefits for Managers and Zenefits Business Intelligence \u2014 tools mostly geared towards larger businesses.</p><p>Conrad is no stranger to the world of startups.

This partnership proved particularly helpful earlier this year when <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/09/payroll-giant-adp-cuts-off-small-business-clients-access-to-zenefits/#.dxazwf:fmeM\">payroll giant ADP shut off access to Zenefits</a> small business customers.

Instead, it says it made sense to include these additions based on customer demand. More than 86 percent of Gusto\u2019s customers have asked for a single point solution to payroll and benefits.</p><p>\u201cWe are automating all of the complex enrollment and administration, so that a business owner can offer this important service to their employees, without any headache,\u201d Reeves said.</p><p>Gusto has also been on a rapid growth tear after raising $60 million in April, building out a Denver office and adding more than 275 employees this year, up from a headcount of 60 at the beginning of the year.

And a year later, Twitter\u2019s now in the middle of finding a new CEO.</p><p>But that hasn\u2019t stopped the company from continuing to following the strategy former CEO Dick Costolo and Roetter put in place to continue building out the company\u2019s engineering team and launch new products. It\u2019s a pretty simple approach \u2014 hire some of the best engineers and put them in small, agile teams with little top-down structure, Roetter said.</p><p>Twitter itself is a complex problem filled with tons of information coming in all at once. The company has to sift through all that data, surface up the best information, and amid all that figure out new ways to make it easier and more approachable for new users. That in of itself is an interesting engineering problem and, in fact, the CEO transition also hasn\u2019t given Twitter any problems bringing in new engineers either, Roetter said.</p><p>We caught up with Roetter this week to hear a bit more about where Twitter\u2019s engineering team is and a little bit more about the atmosphere within Twitter right now. Below is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation.</p><p><strong>TC:</strong>\u00a0Where is Twitter now in terms of its engineering focus and priorities? What are your priorities?</p><p><strong>Alex Roetter:\u00a0</strong>I\u2019ve had this job for about a year, what I\u2019m maniacally focused on is building an environment where world-class engineers\u00a0can do the best they\u2019ve done in\u00a0their careers. One way you know\u00a0it\u2019s working, is we\u2019ve\u00a0seen a massive acceleration of the pace of execution. We\u2019re seeing a bunch of signs of that so far, but of course there\u2019s more to do. One of the ways as well that, you build a stable culture\u00a0where\u00a0you give them basically a really stable vision, really strong teams, and the tools to get their jobs done.</p><p>Twitter, as you know, has this total audience strategy. Twitter has really great, broadly appealing, universally interesting content. However, today you have to use the app to get that content, and the Twitter of the future is much broader. What we mean is, we reach everyone wherever they happen to be. You might be logged in, you might see it through a third-party app, through a syndicate site \u2014 having a stable strategy is an important part of executing on that vision with those teams.\u00a0That\u2019s what we started working on last year.</p><p><strong>TC: </strong>What\u2019s the archetype for engineers that you are looking for in your teams?</p><p><strong><img class=\"  wp-image-1163281 alignleft\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/461410471.jpg?w=387&amp;h=281\" alt=\"recode - dick costolo\" width=\"387\" height=\"281\">AR:\u00a0</strong>The model is, I try to find great people and empower them with the bare minimum of top-down structure they need. Top-down [structure] is great for things like setting a clear direction and explaining what\u2019s important to the company. Other than that, you really want to use [a] top-down [structure] as sparingly as possible. We try to build teams that thrive in an environment with a clear direction, but the details are unspecified. Teams are able to try a bunch of things and fail fast, and hold themselves accountable and measure themselves rigorously. We find that smaller teams are faster, we try to build them in that sort of environment. When there\u2019s no top-down direction around the specific things they can try, they\u2019re left to do bottoms up.</p><p>As a result of that being our philosophy, we look for people who are extremely technically strong, people who run in and fill in the gaps. When there\u2019s an unspecified\u00a0problem, you run in and make it work. You don\u2019t look at it and say, \u2018I\u2019m paralyzed\u2019. We look at people with side projects, open source projects, school projects, and look and see if they\u2019re a cultural fit.</p><p><strong>TC:</strong>\u00a0How do you reconcile the need to bring relevant content to more casual users with some users still wanting a reverse chronological timeline as their primary interface?</p><p><span style=\"line-height:1.625;\"><strong><div class=\"pullquote-wrap left\"><blockquote class=\"pullquote\">Every time you open Twitter, we should show the best stuff to you. </blockquote><span class=\"pullquote-author-pos\">\u2014 Alex Roetter</span></div><br>\nAR:\u00a0</strong>I don\u2019t think they\u2019re mutually exclusive. So, it\u2019s a continuum. For people today who have curated their follower lists and open the app really frequently, Twitter works really well. We can see the app and how often they return. For those people we don\u2019t need to make dramatic changes. </span></p><p><span style=\"line-height:1.625;\">But the other end of the spectrum are\u00a0people we know relatively little about, and the app isn\u2019t as effective as\u00a0it\u00a0could be. Every time you open Twitter, we should show the best stuff to you. We\u2019re gonna try different fits on different parts of that\u00a0spectrum, we think there\u2019s room for both of those to exist. We\u2019ll learn by asking them more targeted questions, observing\u00a0their behavior. For core users, we don\u2019t want to change much, it\u2019s a good product. For this new wave, we can do a lot better, but to get to it you have to dig in to it, know the right moment to open your phone.</span></p><p><strong>TC:</strong> What are the technical challenges for something like that?</p><p><strong>AR:</strong>\u00a0Twitter is a giant info retrieval problem. Here\u2019s an example: \u2018While You Were Away\u2019 is a special case of that. I know what you\u2019ve historically done on twitter, what the other features you\u2019ve used, and we need to instantly score all the content that I can possibly show you, and rank it, and get it out, and get feedback in real-time. When you dismiss [a tweet],\u00a0we ask if it\u2019s helpful. But expanding that further, the tech challenge gets harder. Every time you get to twitter, pull something out of your phone, think of Twitter as immediately considering the content on twitter, your history, the content on the internet, and digesting it and figuring out what to get to you. It has to work globally and be fault tolerant.</p><p><img class=\"  wp-image-748729 aligncenter\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/fail-whale.png?w=597&amp;h=402\" alt=\"fail-whale\" width=\"597\" height=\"402\"></p><p><b>TC:\u00a0</b>I haven\u2019t seen the Fail Whale all that much recently. How have you guys attacked that problem?</p><p><strong>AR:</strong>\u00a0I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve noticed. It\u2019s a large distributed\u00a0systems problem. We split the app into a bunch of independent services that can talk to each other, and then run a bunch of tests. If anything fails, it degrade gracefully. \u2018I can do what I can, but omit one thing when the service fails\u2019 rather than the service just falling over entirely. Twitter\u2019s very bursty, right \u2014 there are events on Twitter that are double sigma events, orders of magnitude heavier. We do load testing, we\u2019re auto injecting failures into the system, so we know we\u2019ll be able to handle them. We take things down, we split the system up. It\u2019s a lot of work but it is paying off.</p><p><b>TC:\u00a0</b>And what are you guys working on, on that front?</p><p><strong>AR:\u00a0</strong>Better ways to handle spikes, better ways to be able to slowly make the experience a little worse for users under cases of heavy load\u00a0rather than just falling over. Most of the uptime has been solved, but we can always take it to the next level. As we work on ranking twitter content and getting it to the timeline, we want to make sure that works.</p><p>Another thing we work on \u2014 it\u2019s not obvious \u2014 you want engineers to move as fast as possible with bare minimum of process but having automation to catch problems so you don\u2019t break something.</p><p><strong>TC:</strong> Does Twitter have code reviews?</p><p><strong>AR:\u00a0</strong>Yep. All the code that goes into production gets reviewed. That\u2019s one of the fundamental principles\u00a0we believe in to do high quality\u00a0work. It\u2019s not so much about catching quality, it\u2019s about sharing knowledge and best practices, and making sure we\u2019re not investing and not reinventing the wheel,\u00a0and serving as a teaching mechanism.</p><p><b>TC:</b> How have things been since the CEO search process started?</p><p><strong>AR:</strong>\u00a0I would say, the shortest is, it\u2019s business as usual. The stuff I talked about, about the total audience strategy and finding them great people, some of the wins you\u2019ve seen like Fabric, While You Were Away, a bunch of others, those are all part of our strategy that were conceived a while ago, those</p><p>The good news is [Twitter interim CEO] Jack [Dorsey\u2019s] been the chairman of the board, he\u2019s fully on board, he has confidence in the team, he knows all of us really well. We\u2019re continuing to execute and accelerate\u00a0the pace. People\u00a0feel good, people know Jack. The reason I think its exciting time, if we answer your question for you, we get the best stuff, wherever you are, then Twitter\u2019s a much more impactful and bigger company than it is today.</p><p><strong>TC:</strong> Has the CEO transition had any effect on recruiting?</p><p><strong>AR:</strong>\u00a0No, not the transition specially. We go after exclusively world-class engineers, they\u2019ve\u00a0always had a lot of options. Recruiting is something I spend a lot of time on, but the great thing is, we\u2019re able to bring in tons of\u00a0really\u00a0strong new people.Nandini Ramini\u00a0to run all our engineering\u00a0effectiveness, that\u2019s a team that\u2019s making sure everyone has the tools to be successful. [VP of platform engineering] Chris Pinkam ran\u00a0parts of Amazon, he now runs all our backend. [New York engineering lead] Vijay Pandurangan, now the engineering\u00a0lead on project Lightning.</p><p><img class=\"  wp-image-1173113 alignright\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/twitter-lightning.png?w=373&amp;h=210\" alt=\"twitter-lightning\" width=\"373\" height=\"210\">But recruiting, we live in a competitive environment, that\u2019s still the case with Dick and Jack as the CEO. That\u2019s just life, but for the right people twitter is an amazing opportunity. you can always go to a bigger company but never move the needle. You can always found your own startup. The thing that attracts people to us is to go work at a $24 billion\u00a0public company where still the company has only realized a small fraction of what it can be. And there are many examples of individuals\u00a0coming in and changing the trajectory\u00a0of the company\u00a0in a short period of time, that\u2019s a compelling story.</p><p><strong>TC:</strong>\u00a0What\u2019s your best story about Dorsey?</p><p><strong>AR:</strong>\u00a0He just started doing this, he does this at Square \u2014 we send out the raw unedited notes from our multi-hour\u00a0staff meeting to the entire company. It\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s hyper\u00a0transparent, they\u2019re not summarized, you see the raw bullets. It exposes all the interesting things we\u2019re working on, it has sections like what the challenges or what were missing. I think it\u2019s really interesting idea he\u2019s pioneered for us around making sure everyone around the company understands. We\u2019ve just done it one week so far, I\u2019ve heard it gets really good results anecdotally.</p><p><strong>TC: </strong>How do you guys view the problem of advertising relevance right now?</p><p><strong><div class=\"pullquote-wrap left\"><blockquote class=\"pullquote\">\u201cWe send out the raw unedited notes from our multi-hour staff meeting to the entire company\u2026 It\u2019s hyper transparent, they\u2019re not summarized, you see the raw bullets.\u201d</blockquote><span class=\"pullquote-author-pos\">\u2014 Alex Roetter</span></div><br>\nAR:\u00a0</strong>I\u00a0was one of\u00a0the earliest engineers\u00a0on the ads team. I was involved in ads for almost five years. It\u2019s a ranking problem, it\u2019s\u00a0an information problem. Our philosophy\u00a0is, we want to show ads to users and marketers that add value, and in the process Twitter makes money. We\u2019re always computing over all the content based on your interests and activities \u2014 What I should show you and how I show you that. We learn correction factors so we can move things up and down depending on quality and what kind of user you are. It\u2019s similar to the sorts of things we\u2019re taking and applying to the timeline. It\u2019s an iterative improvement process. The first day Google started, search wasn\u2019t as good as it is today. You iterate forever. We\u2019ve improved the ad ranking algorithm constantly\u00a0for years, and we\u2019re doing the same thing on the organic side as well.</p><p></p><p><strong>AR:</strong> We take all that and it goes back into the ranking model. We\u2019ll make different predictions based on all the things users do, what you mark as offensive, what you engage with, what you do organically. there are no hard-coded rules about it.</p><p><strong>TC:</strong> What\u2019s are some of the technical problems associated with ads?</p><p><strong>AR:</strong> It\u2019s a real-time, very high velocity large-scale ranking problem. We always want to be able to do a better job \u2014 and I can do a better job for you if I have more data, being able to optimally match you to content. Ads done well can be really great, ads done poorly can be really annoying. Now include\u00a0all the real-time components of this, one thing we\u2019ve learned from tradition ad systems, the real-time signal is really\u00a0important. When we did that our ranking got much better, as measured by real world user behavior.</p><p><b>TC:\u00a0</b>Anything else you want to add?</p><p><strong>AR:</strong> Stuff\u2019s starting to pay off. You see the site is up more, the pace of product development has accelerated. The thing that I think is exciting about twitter and the thing that helps us attract is the realization that the opportunity\u00a0of Twitter is so much bigger if we rejigger the product a little. There\u2019s this unlimited upside for people to come in and work on small, minimal teams and try new things.</p>", "title": ["An Interview With Alex Roetter, Twitter\u2019s Head Of Engineering"], "author": ["Matthew Lynley"]},

In what\u2019s perhaps\u00a0a more meaningful shift, the outfit is\u00a0preparing to raise a growth fund for the first time, too.</p><p class=\"p1\">It\u2019s a lot for 500 Startups\u00a0\u2014 already a hyper-global investing juggernaut \u2014 to take on right now.\u00a0In addition to the three\u00a0\u201cmain\u201d funds that 500 Startups has now raised \u2013 predecessors to the firm\u2019s newest $85 million fund include a $29 million debut fund and a second fund that closed with $44 million \u2014<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span>500 Startups also has a $3 million fund focused on Latin America; a $10 million fund focused on Southeast Asia; a Thailand-focused fund that\u2019s still fundraising and has targeted $10 million; a Korea fund that has similarly targeted $10 million; and, newly, a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/07/500-startups-japan/\">Japan-focused fund</a> that\u2019s looking to raise $30 million. Oh, and lest we forget, it\u2019s also raising a $10 million fund that it\u2019s calling its Mobile Collective vehicle.</p><p class=\"p1\">Of course, firm\u00a0cofounder Dave McClure has never been one to shy from a challenge.\u00a0Indeed, he called us from a\u00a0working vacation in Tokyo over the weekend to share more.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>TC: You\u2019re about to\u00a0begin officially raising a\u00a0fourth global fund. Other than its size,\u00a0how might this new fund differ from your earlier funds?</strong></p><p class=\"p3\">DM: It\u2019s the same strategy.\u00a0I hate\u00a0to be boring, but we like what we\u2019re doing. A lot of folks are chasing different sexy things like drones and virtual reality\u00a0and the Internet of Things,\u00a0and those are all great\u00a0and\u00a0we\u2019ll do a bit of each of them, but e-commerce, marketplaces and SaaS is our bread and butter, and we don\u2019t see those [sectors] dying down any time soon. Globally, in fact, they\u2019re growing.</p><p class=\"p3\">Regarding other details,\u00a0half the capital will be used for initial investments, with the rest for follow on investments. And this\u00a0fund will have a slightly longer time horizon. We\u2019ve invested each of our main funds over the course of two years; we plan to invest this over three years.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>TC: You\u2019re already planning to reserve half a $200 million fund for follow-on investments, assuming you raise it. Why also start plotting a growth fund?</strong></p><p class=\"p3\">DM: We have a lot\u00a0of companies doing well from our\u00a0two first funds, and there are lots of follow-on investments\u00a0that we\u2019ve chosen not to make because they were\u00a0outside our budget. We consider those missed opportunities. We think 5 to 7 percent of our investments will get to Series C rounds, or $100 million-plus in value, and we want [a bigger share] of those companies.</p><p class=\"p3\"><strong>TC: Y Combinator is raising a growth fund and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/22/y-combinator-finally-reveals-its-approach-to-growth-stage-investing/\">said recently</a> that it plans to invest its pro rata in every deal of a certain size led by other institutional investors in order to minimize any signaling issues. Y Combinator and 500 Startups compete to some degree. Will you take a similar approach?</strong></p><p class=\"p3\">DM: I don\u2019t\u00a0know that I agree with that philosophy. We\u2019re not worried that it\u2019s a signaling issue [to participate in some companies\u2019 later rounds] because\u00a0there are much larger investors than us making decisions. If our opinion matters more than a company\u2019s business fundamentals, that\u2019s a problem.</p><p class=\"p3\">We\u2019re in the business to make money; we\u2019re not in\u00a0the business of [providing follow-on] funding [to] every company in our portfolio. There will be situations where we think a valuation isn\u2019t on target or where we think we have enough ownership already, and we\u2019re\u00a0comfortable making\u00a0our own decisions.

An exact date was not named, but Weiner said an ads API was a \u201chigh priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntroducing a robust set of APIs for social marketing agencies to best leverage the platform is a high priority,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not pre-announcing a date but it\u2019s high on our list.\u201d</p><p>To be clear, LinkedIn already offers an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developer.linkedin.com/partner\">Ads API</a>, but it\u2019s in a limited, private release at the moment; its partners are Adobe, AdStage, Bizo and Unified. Launching a wider, public advertising API, therefore, would be a sign of how LinkedIn is looking to get more serious about how it makes revenue from ads on its platform. </p><p>An advertising API will also allow companies to more easily make media buys, and will specifically mean that third party social media marketing and advertising agencies will be able to link up with LinkedIn, which can then get incorporated into larger media buys made through those agencies.</p><p>And, following from Facebook\u2019s introduction of an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/2011/08/01/ads-ap-apply/\">advertising API in August 2011</a>, and Twitter\u2019s in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/20/twitter-ads-api/\">February 2013</a>, LinkedIn introducing an advertising API will also be a sure sign that we will start to see more ad units as a result.</p><p>Right now, LinkedIn does not break out how much money it makes from advertising. The company tells me that it roughly categorizes those revenues in its \u201cMarketing Solutions\u201d division (one ad unit, where companies can advertise to \u201cWork with us\u201d, goes into Talent Solutions). In LinkedIn\u2019s Q2 earnings reported earlier today, Marketing Solutions made up 24%, or $87.36 million, of the company\u2019s $364 million in total revenues. With LinkedIn\u2019s user numbers and features growing \u2014 including enhanced home pages for users with more news and other information, as well as a revamped search \u2014 there is room for ads to grow, too.</p><p>And that\u2019s before considering mobile. The company has only recently started to introduce advertising on mobile, which now makes up about a third of all of LinkedIn\u2019s traffic.</p>", "title": ["LinkedIn Wants To Ramp Up Ads With An Advertising API Like Twitter\u2019s And Facebook\u2019s; A \u2018High Priority\u2019 Says CEO Weiner"], "author": ["Ingrid Lunden"]},

At the 33rd Annual JPMorganChase Health Care Conference today, Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad plans to share some of the company\u2019s financials, which will put its growth numbers into perspective.</p><p>In a presentation this afternoon, Conrad will reveal that at the close of its fiscal year this month, Zenefits will surpass $20 million in annually recurring revenue after less than two years in business. That\u2019s up from $1 million at the same time last year, which means the company grew 20x over the last 12 months.</p><p>Based on its current growth trajectory, Zenefits expects annually recurring revenue to grow to $100 million over the next year. That might not seem like a lot, especially given the amount of money it\u2019s raised since being founded (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zenefits\">about $85 million</a>) and its most recent valuation (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/03/zenefits-66-5m-a16z-ivp/\">$500 million</a>).</p><p>But let\u2019s put the company\u2019s\u00a0growth trajectory into context: It took SaaS businesses like Workday and Salesforce about four years to reach $20 million in annual recurring revenue; and it took each of them about five or six years to hit $100 million.</p><p>The most interesting thing about those numbers is that, unlike some other enterprise SaaS companies, Zenefits doesn\u2019t charge for use of its cloud-based HR platform. It\u2019s only if customers choose to designate it as their insurance broker that Zenefits makes any money. Even then, it receives a commission from the insurance provider, so customers continue to enjoy use of its platform for free.</p><p>All of this points to why private investors have been clamoring to invest in Zenefits, and why it has such aggressive plans to expand. It also might help explain why Yammer founder David Sacks came out of retirement to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/10/zenefits-david-sacks/\">join Zenefits as COO</a>\u00a0despite <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/19/microsoft-completes-its-1-2b-yammer-acquisition/\">already being a bazillionaire</a>.</p><p>Zenefits started off 2014 by raising a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/22/zenefits-adds-15m-from-andreessen-horowitz-to-become-the-all-in-one-solution-for-startup-hr/\">pretty modest $15 million funding round</a> from Andreessen Horowitz, but quickly added to its coffers. Six months later, it went back and got another <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/03/zenefits-66-5m-a16z-ivp/\">$66.5 million from a16z and Institutional Venture Partners</a>.</p><p>Based on its growth projections, the company has also been hiring aggressively. In 2014, the company went from 15 to more than 500 employees. Headcount is set to balloon even further, as Zenefits recently <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/11/zenefits-scottsdale/\">opened a 100,000-square foot office in Scottsdale, Ariz.</a>, where it expects to hire 1,300 employees over the next three years.</p><p>While Zenefits\u2019 revenue numbers are impressive, especially for a company that is just two years old, it\u2019s worth pointing out that not all revenue is created equal. It isn\u2019t clear how expensive its revenue is to generate, especially considering the massive increase in the company\u2019s headcount recently.</p><p>Other fast-growing SaaS businesses, like Box for example, eventually reported revenue that cost far more to generate than some expected. The result of that was a delayed public offering at a lower per-share price than was first assumed.</p><p>The market could be given some indication of how quickly the firm is spending cash to grow its recurring revenue by the timing and size of its next financing round.</p>", "title": ["Zenefits Financials Reveal It Is One Of The Fastest-Growing SaaS Businesses Ever"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

Rides will cost less than $1 (66 rupees), compared to the average $4-$6 price of a ride in a private taxi.</p><p>In exchange for sharing your space with between 12 and 20 other people, the\u00a0shuttles will come with air conditioning, WiFi access, and in-vehicle entertainment, he says. (For those in the U.S., it\u2019s not unlike the service Via, which is offering an <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/02/via-raises-27m-for-its-flat-rate-5-urban-carpool-style-ride-sharing-service/\">urban shuttle service</a> initially in NYC.)</p><p>\u201cMillions of Indians undertake their daily commute in our cities using their own vehicles, cabs or other modes of personal transportation,\u201d\u00a0Bhavish Aggarwal, co-founder &amp; CEO at Ola, said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cWith Shuttle, we intend to create a comfortable and reliable commute experience for them at the tap of a button on their smartphones.

It\u2019s also taken\u00a0a page from Uber\u2019s playbook and moved into other areas like food delivery.</p><p>As with Didi Kuaidi in China, Ola\u2019s\u00a0rivalry with Uber is more in anticipation of what may be to come, rather than the state of the market today: Ola\u2019s total share of vehicles on the streets today works out to around 80% <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cdn.softbank.jp/en/corp/set/data/irinfo/presentations/results/pdf/2014/softbank_presentation_2014_004.pdf\">says Softbank</a>, putting it well ahead of its closest\u00a0rival Meru at 12%, giving\u00a0the company the bigger platform to seize whatever opportunity there may be to target India\u2019s</p><p>That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t other services out there\u00a0that might rival Ola Shuttle, or companies that might not decide to launch a similar service to compete with it.</p><p>Meru launched\u00a0a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://trak.in/tags/business/2015/07/08/meru-cabs-carpooling-mumbai-ola/\">carpooling service in July</a>; TaxiForSure (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/olaforsure/\">owned by Ola</a>) also has a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/taxiforsure-launches-carpooling-service/article6668358.ece\">carpooling offer</a>; and BlaBlaCar, which launched in India\u00a0in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.blablacar.co.uk/blog/india-launch\">January</a>\u00a02015 (and\u00a0is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://t.co/njMBIv0p7u\">raising more money too</a>) also offers shared-riding services.

Obtained documents reveal a top-secret email and Internet-behavior collection program, authorized back in 2001. Specifically, the NSA is collecting \u201cmetadata\u201d on which websites were visited and who users were contacting, but not the content of those communications or websites.</p><p>\u201cThe calls you make can reveal a lot, but now that so much of our lives are mediated by the internet, your IP [internet protocol] logs are really a real-time map of your brain: what are you reading about, what are you curious about, what personal ad are you responding to (with a dedicated email linked to that specific ad), what online discussions are you participating in, and how often?\u201d, explained Julian Sanchez of the Cato Institute</p><p>Additionally, the NSA was collecting data on the \u2018to,\u2019 \u2018from\u2019 or \u2018bcc\u2019 lines of a standard email or other electronic communication\u201d from Americans to foreigners.</p><p>Officials tell The Guardian the 2-year data collection policy was halted in 2011, but Glenn Greenwald and Spencer Ackerman are skeptical.

Labor <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/14/ubercommissioner/\">unions have aggressively fought Uber</a> and Lyft, which threaten taxi drivers with increased competition. They\u2019ve effectively paralyzed a multi-billion-dollar sharing economy industry from spreading around the country.</p><p>Not to be outdone, one of the largest labor unions in the country, AFL-CIO, is the leading opponent of more high-skilled immigrants, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/17/union-tech-industry-is-greedy-for-wanting-to-end-hiring-wait-period-for-immigrants/\">calling the tech community</a> \u201cgreedy\u201d for wanting to make it easier to hire foreign engineers.</p><p>Technology is in the business of disrupting industries. Startups will tell you that it takes every ounce of brains and grit to get a product off the ground; they don\u2019t just need an environment that acquiesces to technology, but fully embraces the chaos.</p><p>Two surveys, one from 1983 and another I conducted this month, illustrate the differences in attitudes on innovation between tech workers and unionized workers.</p><p>As far back as I can see, unions have been tech-averse. In one 1983 survey of labor unions [<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.erudit.org/revue/ri/1983/v38/n1/029330ar.pdf\">PDF</a>], Researcher Stephen Peitchinis found that a mere 14 percent of unions had policies advocating for technology change, while 14 percent actively opposed innovation if it threatened members\u2019 jobs. Most (42 percent) have policies that begrudgingly accept technology so long as employers do so in a way that minimizes its impact on the workforce.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-853034\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2013-07-29 at 11.38.27 AM\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/screen-shot-2013-07-29-at-11-38-27-am.png?w=636&amp;h=255\" width=\"636\" height=\"255\"></p><p>Peitchinis also has a few historical gems in the paper, including one of a railway union that fought to keep fire-safety workers on board <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.coyoteblog.com/coyote_blog/2005/08/great_moments_i-4.html\"><em>after</em> trains got rid of coal power</a>.</p><p>It is no shocker, then, why economists generally find an inverse relationship between innovation and unionization. \u201cIndeed, economists generally find that unions stall innovation,\u201d\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2232351\">wrote</a>\u00a0a research team from the University of South Florida in May. \u201cFirm innovation output, measured by patent counts and citations, declines significantly after firms elect to unionize and increases significantly for firms that vote to deunionize.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s no wonder that unions never found a foothold in the Valley.</p><p>Since the survey was conducted in 1983, I wanted to see if the protectionist sentiment was still around. I tried to replicate the spirit of the study, using Google Surveys to gauge the attitudes on job-replacing-technology on union workers vs. people who work in the tech industry.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-853035\" alt=\"chart_1 (1)\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/chart_1-1.png?w=580&amp;h=405\" width=\"580\" height=\"405\"></p><p>Roughly twice as many respondents in tech were willing to sacrifice their jobs for innovation (16.5 percent vs. 30 percent). Three times as many unionized employees were willing to stand in the way of innovation to protect jobs (27 percent vs. 11 percent).</p><p>Unions may be quite valuable in other parts of the country, but they haven\u2019t been needed much in the Valley. Despite having no union, Facebook, Google and other tech companies are consistently <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/13/why-facebook-the-best-company-to-work-for-doesnt-need-a-union/\">voted the \u201cbest\u201d companies to work for in America</a>. Cushy salaries, luxurious dining amenities, and decentralized management structures provide an elite class of high-tech workers all the benefits and influence that unions have long hoped for.</p><p>Moreover, the Valley has long subsisted on freelancers, who roam between high-tech firms. \u201cI think unionization would ruin the free spirit and innovation in the high-tech industry,\u201d freelance web designer Alvin Bost\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/news/high-technology-discovers-unions/96343\">told</a> CNET in 2001. \u201cIt would be terrible for people like me.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, those outside the Valley bubble <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/30/in-defense-of-prosperous-inequality/\">have experienced rising inequality</a>, as technology automates more and more jobs. It\u2019s a serious problem. If Google ran the BART system, I seriously doubt a human would still be powering every train.</p><p>However, I think Slate is wrong to characterize this as \u201cclass warfare.\u201d Many technology workers hold a genuine philosophical belief that the benefits to innovation outweigh the short-term gains of protecting workers. I think many in the Valley have been honest about their philosophical assumptions, and it\u2019s time for unions to be honest about theirs.</p><p>*<em>Graph 2 Methods: We ran a single-question survey to a 1000 respondents via Google Surveys.

{"date": ["2013-02-20"], "text": "<p>Twitter just <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://advertising.twitter.com/2013/02/announcing-twitter-ads-api_20.html\">announced via blog post</a> that it has launched an advertising API, which will allow brands to run ad campaigns through the company\u2019s API partners, rather than having to buy them through Twitter itself.</p><p>This <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/27/twitter-is-finally-preparing-to-release-its-advertising-api-in-q1-say-sources/\">confirms a report by TechCrunch\u2019s Ingrid Lunden</a> saying that Twitter would launch its ads API sometime in the first quarter of this year. At the time, Ingrid noted that Twitter\u2019s ad-buying interface requires you to upload promoted tweets one at a time, an approach that\u2019s unwieldy for large campaigns. She also said that an API creates the opportunity for more sophisticated targeting and tools.</p><p>The initial five partners for the program are Adobe, Hootsuite, Salesforce, SHIFT, and TBG Digital. Twitter says it has been testing the API with them since January. We can probably expect that number to increase fairly quickly, and indeed the blog post includes a link to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/form/apply-access-twitter-ads-api\">an application for potential partners</a>.</p><p>Here\u2019s how Twitter describes the program:</p><p>You\u2019ll note that the post also nods towards the importance of preserving Twitter\u2019s user experience. Elsewhere in the post, the company writes, \u201cAs interest in Twitter has grown, our focus has been on delivering <em>better</em> ads for users, not <em>more</em> ads.\u201d (That hasn\u2019t stopped some Twitter users to view any ad-related announcement with skepticism.) Nothing in the announcement should lead to immediate changes in the user experience, but one of the main reasons to launch the API is to grow the program, so I\u2019d be surprised if we don\u2019t see more ads at some point. Hopefully the \u201cbetter\u201d part will hold true, too.</p><p>We\u2019ve also reported that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/18/god-bless-us-every-one/\">Twitter hit $350 million in revenue</a> last year, and that it expects to hit $1 billion sometime in the next couple of years. (There are conflicting reports about the exact timeline.) The Ads API could be an important step towards hitting that goal.</p><p><strong>Update:\u00a0</strong>I just spoke with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tbgdigital.com/\">TBG</a> CEO Simon Mansell about his experience testing the API. He said TBG has five clients live or going live on the API, and while he warned against reading too much into early data, he did say that one client saw a 61 percent decrease in cost-per-engagement, while another used the TBG\u2019s API integration for $40,000 in ad spending during the Super Bowl.</p><p>Mansell added that he\u2019s particularly excited about how the platform could expand in the future. The first piece, which is what\u2019s available now, focuses on creating \u201cworkflow efficiencies,\u201d for example by identifying the best-performing keywords, so that it\u2019s easier to run campaigns on Twitter. Later he plans to add more tools for launching and managing campaigns in real-time, and for measuring the return on investment in those campaigns.</p><p>Asked if we can expect to see the proliferation of startups building around the Twitter API, similar to what happened after the launch of Facebook\u2019s Ads API, Mansell said, \u201cI definitely think there \u00a0will be a lot more companies like us talking about it.\u201d (He also said that building a community around its API was \u201cone of the smartest things Facebook\u2019s done.\u201d)</p><p>Adobe, meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/digital-marketing/social-media/adobe-brings-twitter-ads-to-life-announces-early-campaign-results/\">released its own early results</a>, saying that it was able to increase customer\u2019s follower counts by 63 percent and to decrease the cost per follow 60 percent, or approximately $2.</p>", "title": ["Twitter Launches Ads API, So Marketers Can Run Campaigns Through Adobe, Salesforce, Others"], "author": ["Anthony Ha"]},

While other services like Flipboard and Zite used social updates and complicated algorithms to present users with a personalized view of the world, the Pulse team eschewed these ideas and stuck with a more traditional model of presenting you unfiltered feeds. Now, however, the company is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.pulse.me/\">slowly dipping its toes into social</a> by adding \u201cPulse Highlights,\u201d a feature that puts a focus on the stories your friends have shared on the service and on Facebook.</p><p>This new feature will be available in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pulse.me/android\">Android app</a> today.

People, he believes, have always come to the app to read content from sites they trust, but now they will also be able to discover new sources and stories that they probably would have missed in their regular Facebook streams.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always been good at providing you with really good things to read,\u201d Kothari said. \u201cBut now we are also getting into discovery.\u201d Pulse Highlights, he also noted, lets you take your Facebook feed and \u201cremove the fluff.\u201d The other good thing about using Facebook, Kothari said, is that you will even see recommendations if none of your friends use Pulse itself (though he hopes that the Facebook connection will give Pulse users a reason to get their friends on the social network to try it, too).</p><p>The company started experimenting with social and algorithm-based recommendations about a year ago. The team was neither impressed with an approach purely based on how popular a post was on social networks (what does it really mean, after all, when a story gets 500 Facebook likes?) and its forays into purely algorithmic solutions similar to Zite also didn\u2019t quite pan out because its beta testers were never quite sure why they were seeing a certain article. With Highlights, Pulse argues, \u201cdiscovery is about people: close friends and family sharing content that\u2019s interesting and relevant for you.\u201d</p><p>In the long run, Pulse hopes to build upon this foundation with more granular sharing options and the ability to not just highlight a complete story but also just parts of it. Pulse also expects that this new sharing data will be useful for the advertisers on the service, who will now be able to get a better idea of how their content is doing on the service.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/12/pulse-news-reader-dips-its-toes-into-social/pulse_social_highlights_tablet/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-756228\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-756228\" alt=\"pulse_social_highlights_tablet\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pulse_social_highlights_tablet.png?w=680&amp;h=546\"></a></p>", "title": ["Pulse News Reader Dips Its Toes Into Social With New \u201cHighlights\u201d Feature"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},

Its users, as the company\u2019s CEO Akshay Kothari told me last week, have long been asking for a web version, but the team decided to focus on <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/pulse-adds-premium-subscriptions-launches-innovative-partnership-with-wsj/\">adding more publishing partners</a> and getting the mobile experience right before tackling the web. Now, however, after nine months of development and with a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://windowsteamblog.com/ie/b/ie/archive/2012/08/09/with-internet-explorer-10-pulse-comes-to-the-web.aspx\">little help from Microsoft</a>, the Pulse team feels that its web app is ready to launch.</p><p>Kothari told me that he \u201cwanted to make sure that the quality of the experience remained in line with what Pulse create on mobile.\u201d For a company that was always so focused on mobile, that was quite an interesting challenge. In Kothari\u2019s view, iOS and Android are also relatively easy to develop for compared to the web where the large variety of browsers, operating system and add a lot more complexity compared to tightly controlled platforms like iOS and even Android.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/09/pulse-web-launch/1-%20webapp_screenshot_page/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-625202\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/1-20webapp_screenshot_page.png?w=640&amp;h=360\" alt=\"\" title=\"1.%20WebApp_Screenshot_Page\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-625202\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p>In terms of the web app\u2019s feature set, Pulse pretty much offers the same features as on mobile. Because your data on all the different platforms always stays in sync, you can easily start using the web version and see all your regular news sources right after you sign in for the first time. The web app, says Pulse, is \u201cdesigned for discovery\u201d and while it\u2019s still a very visual experience, Pulse did away with the row layout it uses in its mobile apps. Instead, your list of sources is now on the left and stories appear in a beautiful dynamic grid layout. The design is responsive, so the layout will automatically adapt itself to the size of your browser windows.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/09/pulse-web-launch/1-%20webapp_readingview_open/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-625203\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/1-20webapp_readingview_open.png?w=640&amp;h=359\" alt=\"\" title=\"1.%20WebApp_ReadingView_open\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-625203\" height=\"359\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/09/pulse-web-launch/pulse_windows_tablet/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-625206\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/pulse_windows_tablet.jpg?w=300&amp;h=180\" title=\"pulse_windows_tablet\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-625206 alignright\" height=\"180\" width=\"300\"></a>To do all of this, Pulse got a little help from Microsoft (and also worked with the designers at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thinkpixellab.com/\">Pixel Lab</a>). Microsoft decided that Pulse would make for a great app to demo the advanced web features of IE10 on Windows 8. The company also helped Pulse optimize the web app for tablets and other touch-enabled devices. Kothari gave me a demo of Pulse running in the chromeless version of IE10 in Metro on a Windows 8 tablet last week and it\u2019s indeed a very compelling product there, too, with fluid animations and the ability to use complex multi-touch swipe gestures to control the app. On a Windows tablet, it just takes a swipe to switch between stories, a two-finger swipe opens up the reading list and the standard pinch gesture closes an article. Despite these optimizations, though, Pulse still works in every other modern browser, too.</p><p>As Microsoft\u2019s general manager for Internet Explorer Ryan Gavin notes today, \u201cto date, touch in a browser environment has been pretty limited. Basic swipe and click commands are really it, constrained by a browser platform that essentially only supports elementary gestures. The net result is touch has become second class citizen when you browse the web on your favorite device.\u201d Given Microsoft\u2019s focus on touch with Windows 8, though, it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that the company chose a highly visual app like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pulse.me\">Pulse</a> to highlight the power of its platform.</p>", "title": ["Pulse Comes To The Web (With A Little Help From Microsoft)"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},

We wouldn\u2019t be here if there weren\u2019t so many creative entrepreneurs out there trying to build something worthwhile out of nothing but ideas, sweat, and a little risk capital.  A little risk can go a long why.  And while it is true that this year\u2019s crop brought <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/17/memo-to-start-ups-you%E2%80%99re-supposed-to-be-changing-the-world-remember/\">fewer wild ideas</a> than in the past, it is also true that by and large there were a lot more solid ideas as well.</p><p>One of the best things about TechCrunch50 is not what happens on stage, but what happens before companies even get there.  Startups that don\u2019t even have a working demo or a product are forced to build one just to be considered.  So many startup founders at TechCrunch50, even those who don\u2019t make it to the final 50, have told me how valuable this selection process is.  There is nothing like a deadline to focus your ideas. And once you are there, the dealmaking in the DemoPit was intense.</p><p>Over the course of the two-day conference, we covered all 50 finalist demos, put up more than a dozen video interviews, and reported announcements made at TC50 from <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/bing-pops-with-visual-search/\">Bing</a>, <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/15/facebook-crosses-300-million-users-oh-yeah-and-their-cash-flow-just-went-positive/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/a-new-way-to-visually-search-google-news-they-call-it-flipper/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/15/aim-is-now-faster-better-more-streamy/\">AOL</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/15/myspace-has-built-its-own-recommendation-engine-and-theyre-open-sourcing-it/\">MySpace</a>. Even the TC50 winner from two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/the-value-of-techcrunch50-mint-acquired-by-intuit-for-170m-two-years-after-winning-tc40/\">Mint</a>, had its own little announcement.  If you weren\u2019t one of the nearly 2,000 people in attendance, perhaps you were one of the 97,855 unique viewers who caught some of the presentations streamed live on video.</p><p>The video was shot and uploaded by the team at <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/\">Ustream</a>, who also were able to cut and upload archived video clips for each presentation within an hour of each one.  Those video clips are embedded at the bottom of each post and is probably the best way to relive the experience.</p><p>There was so much happening at the conference, even if you were there you missed half of it.  Below is a handy list of links to all of our TC50 coverage, including every company demo, announcement, backstage interview, and commentary.  There is also an extensive list of links to other coverage (if we are missing something, let us know) and, at the very bottom, to Crunchbase profiles of each of the 50 finalists.</p><p><img

These growers have developed unique grow-how to deliver a medical grade product.</p><p>\u201cIsraeli growers have agreements with companies in USA, Canada, Czech Republic and Australia. Israel has the oldest and largest regulated medical cannabis programs in the world with over 22,000 registered patients. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://new.huji.ac.il/\">Hebrew University</a> holds a rich IP bank of cannabis patents. It is easier to conduct cannabis research and clinical studies in Israel than in any other country in the world,\u201d said Saul Kaye, the founder of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://israel-cannabis.com/\">iCan</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.canna-tech.co/\">CannaTech</a>, a yearly cannabis innovation and investor summit in Israel.</p><p>Governments and multinationals are currently flocking to Israel where clinical testing faces fewer hurdles.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIsrael is playing a large role in clinical trials and foreign governments and multinationals come to Israel for this purpose. In the US, the DEA does not allow for the transportation of raw materials. A company in New York cannot import enough raw cannabis to conduct the clinical trials,\u201d said Dr. Tamir Gedo, the CEO of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.shaefa.co.il/\">Breath of Life</a>, a manufacturer of pharmacy grade API for companies looking to conduct clinical trials.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The country\u2019s\u00a0warm climate coupled with its\u00a0accumulated know-how in all things agriculture and farming are fertile ground to transform the desert state into a player on the global medical marijuana market. Even though the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1961_en.pdf\">UN\u2019s 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs</a> prevents the trafficking of narcotics, Israel has the ability to circumvent the convention by having the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.health.gov.il/English/MinistryUnits/HealthDivision/cannabis/Pages/default.aspx\">Medical Cannabis Unit of the Health Ministry</a> turn itself into a national narcotics agency.</p><p>Regulatory conditions are also helping to sow the seeds for a cannabis culture, since\u00a0the Ministry of Health is\u00a0the only national FDA equivalent body that has publicly declared and accepted the benefits of cannabis. In fact,\u00a0Israel has already approved a vast number of medical conditions for treatment with cannabis, including cancer, epilepsy, neurological conditions and MS.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThe Israeli government has started to understand the economic benefits of cannabis. I believe medical cannabis will be be bigger and more profitable than all the arms exports combined,\u201d Gedo said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The potential for cannabis crop to create significant\u00a0export revenues has some entrepreneurs envisioning a future in which the herb functions as a peace pipe to bring other countries from the region to the trade table.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIsrael\u2019s neighbours in the Mediterranean are years away from recognizing and organizing their medical cannabis programs. In the future, neighboring countries will almost certainly look to Israel to model their own programs. Israel now has the potential to export our knowledge and skills to these countries,\u201d Kaye said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oren Leibovitz the editor of the Israeli cannabis news and information website, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xn--4dbcyzi5a.com/\">Cannabis</a> and the chairman of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aleyarok.org.il/\">Green Leaf</a> (Ale Yarok) party, is confident that Israel will soon become an international cannabis powerhouse.</p><p>\u201cIn the next few months, the exporting of medical cannabis might be approved by the Knesset [Israeli parliament], which will make cannabis the country\u2019s #1 export, superseding weaponry and, potentially, natural gas,\u201d Leibovitch said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Leibovitch\u2019s political movement is growing rapidly and garnered 50,000 (out of 4,255,000 votes) votes in the 2015 election. While Israel is still far from decriminalizing cannabis, Leibovitch believes that due to the political support from the political parties on the left and right, Israel will soon move towards a more liberal approach to cannabis.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhat happens in America, always happens in Israel 10 years later. I envision Israel to join the state of Colorado and other pro-legalization states by the year 2024,\u201d Leibovitch said.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Israelis witnessed a concrete move to decriminalize cannabis in June this year when Yinon Magal, a member of the Israeli Knesset (parliament) introduced a bill that would decriminalize cannabis for recreational use. The law would allow one plant and up to five grams of cannabis for personal use. Moreover, the chair of the Committee on Drug and Alcohol Abuse, Tamar Zandberg is a proponent of decriminalizing the personal use of cannabis.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Indeed, there are many in Israel who believe that the time is ripe for new legislation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In spite of possible legal and political hurdles, a number of Israeli startups in the medical marijuana space have began developing products that directly or indirectly relate to the cannabis industry.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Tel Aviv based <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.syqemedical.com/\">Syqe Medical</a> developed the world\u2019s first precision metered dose inhaler and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cannabics.com/\">Cannabics Pharmaceuticals</a> is developing cannabinoid-based treatments and therapies while companies such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ibreedit.com/\">BreedIt</a> are providing \u00a0advanced agro-breeding technologies.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While Israeli companies are making headway in cannabis tech, many Israeli politicians are still hesitant to fully back the industry due to perception-induced fear.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"></p><p>\u201cIsrael does not want to have the reputation of being the world\u2019s number one narcotics exporter. Instead, we should be known as the number one medical solutions exporter. Understandably, the political process is influenced by perception and politicians are still fearful of the connotations of being labeled as pro-drugs,\u201d said Dr. Oded Sagee, the founder and CEO of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ibreedit.com/\">BreedIt</a>.</p><p>Therefore, Israel should perhaps position itself as an exporter of medical solutions, by focusing on the end-product, rather than on exporting raw, unprocessed cannabis, according to Sagee.</p><p>\u201cWe can provide products for specific purposes, for example tailored cannabis for cancer, MS and other illnesses. Israel should export medical solutions, not narcotics. We don\u2019t want to be in the business of exporting cannabis for recreational use,\u201d Sagee concluded.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Israeli contributions to cannabis research actually spans decades.\u00a0Over a half century ago, in 1963 an Israeli researcher at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Dr. Raphael Mechoulam identified the structure of cannabidiol (CBD) \u00a0and isolated THC for the first time. Because of Mechoulam and his team\u2019s efforts, 20,000 Israelis are able to enjoy the benefits of medical cannabis.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Today, Israel is at the precipice of becoming a major force in the field of cannabis and medical marijuana, but country\u2019s successes are often hindered by external forces, but today \u2013 according to the leader of the cannabis movement \u2013 the enemy comes from within.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThe only thing preventing Israel from becoming a cannabis superpower is the Israeli government,\u201d Leibovitch said.</p>", "title": ["Israel Could Grow Into A Global Cannabis Startup Superpower"], "author": ["Dennis Mitzner"]},
{"date": ["2015-07-10"], "text": "<p>There\u2019s been a lot of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://freddestin.com/2015/07/signalling-seed-rounds.html\">talk</a> in venture circles lately about \u201csignaling risk\u201d and\u00a0seed-stage investments. The gist: When earlier backers are high-profile venture firms, and these firms decide not to participate in a startup\u2019s next round, it\u00a0hurts the company\u2019s\u00a0ability to raise a Series A round.</p><p>Although\u00a0this concern isn\u2019t exactly new, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/signaling-risk-venture-capital/\">recent numbers</a> published by the firm CB Insights suggest that the issue is worth revisiting. According CB Insights\u2019s\u00a0findings, while 35 percent of all venture-backed, seed-funded companies go on to raise a Series A, a company that counts a respected venture firm among its seed backers has a 51 percent chance of raising a Series A if that firm participates in the round.</p><p>That\u2019s the good news. The bad: If the venture firm decides not participate in the startup\u2019s Series A, the company\u2019s chances of closing its Series A round drop to 27 percent.</p><p>The study made us think about\u00a0Y Combinator, the popular accelerator program, and its plan for the future. Right\u00a0now, Y Combinator has the best of both worlds. It can make seed-stage investments at scale, for sizable stakes in startups, and not worry in the least about signaling risk:\u00a0no one expects it to pour more of its capital into follow-on rounds. Its very model is premised on finding\u00a0and\u00a0funneling smart companies to other Series A, B, and C investors.</p><p>Recently, however, some have speculated that\u00a0Y Combinator is\u00a0heading into a future where it is both seed and growth-stage investor. According to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/y-combinator-raising-money-for-late-stage-fund-2015-3\">March report</a> from Business Insider, the outfit might raise \u201cseveral billion dollars\u201d to make later-stage investments in those of its companies that start hot and stay hot (see Airbnb). A source to The Information estimates that the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1645142/000164514215000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml\">Y Combinator Continuity Fund </a>(as it is listed in an SEC filing)\u00a0will be closer to $1 billion in size.</p><p>Maybe Y Combinator has to go later stage. Maybe it\u2019s too hard to support the\u00a0organization at its current size without owning more of its\u00a0home runs, including Airbnb (valued at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/17/airbnb-valuation-revenue/\">$24 billion</a> currently) and Twitch, which sold to Amazon last year for <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/amazon-will-officially-acquire-twitch/\">$970 million</a> in cash.</p><p>Still, if Y Combinator uses its war chest to cherry pick deals from its portfolio of graduates or\u00a0even if it skips a few stages to invest in a limited number of \u201cvery, very late stage\u201d deals,\u00a0as <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/if-y-combinator-did-a-growth-fund-it-would-be-very-very-late-stage/\">TechCrunch sources</a> have suggested might happen, it could create huge signaling risk for the many startups it funds. (It\u2019s\u00a0possible\u00a0that Y Combinator could\u00a0follow on in every one\u00a0of the venture-backed rounds of its\u00a0portfolio companies, but the moment\u00a0it doesn\u2019t . . .)</p><p>Y Combinator\u2019s big fund could have other consequences. Until now, Y Combinator hasn\u2019t had to displace other investors to earn a place on\u00a0a company\u2019s cap table, but if it wants to\u00a0become a growth investor and take significant ownership of particular companies, it will\u00a0need to win competitive deals against other firms that want to invest. And\u00a0Y Combinator may find that many of the investors it counts as friends won\u2019t be\u00a0so friendly when they\u2019re going head-to-head over deals.</p><p>Investing in later-stage companies is also a different skill set than mentoring seed-stage companies. Although Y Combinator will undoubtedly hire partners who have experience with later-stage deals, Y Combinator\u2019s DNA is helping companies at the earliest stages figure out who they want to be.\u00a0 That\u2019s not to say the firm can\u2019t do both, but presumably it will take time to get right and it would seem to spread the firm thin, no matter how many people are involved.</p><p>The Information <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/The-Who-and-Why-of-the-YC-Venture-Fund\">recently suggested</a> if Y Combinator goes later stage, the \u201conly shot\u201d that VCs will have at competing with it will be to \u201cgo earlier and earlier themselves.\u201d\u00a0Maybe, though we imagine that top funds don\u2019t need to sweat it just yet. Entrepreneurs will continue to want other, experienced voices at the table, especially if those voices are coming from places\u00a0like Sequoia Capital.</p><p>The Information further\u00a0suggested that Y Combinator\u00a0might be more willing\u00a0to fund\u00a0\u201cmoonshots\u201d than other firms. We love that idea, though it does bring to mind Kleiner Perkins, which was at the top of its game when it decided to pursue some moonshots of its own in clean energy. As industry watchers know, that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/a-humbled-kleiner-perkins-adjusts-its-strategy/?_r=0\">didn\u2019t go so well</a>.</p><p>We\u00a0give Y Combinator credit for thinking about its next moves. We\u00a0admire how much it has changed in the last 17 months under the leadership of Sam Altman. And we\u00a0don\u2019t doubt that whatever Y Combinator has up its sleeve, it will show original thinking.</p><p>We just hope Y Combinator\u00a0doesn\u2019t lose sight of its core mission.\u00a0It does\u00a0seem to have things awfully good\u00a0right now.</p>", "title": ["Y Combinator\u2019s Big Future"], "author": ["Connie Loizos"]},

While unions still have an influential role througout the United States, it appears they might not have much of a future.</p><p>\u201dAs far as me personally, and for everyone else here, unions have never come up,\u201d software engineer Matt Shea, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/26/business/joe-hill-in-high-tech-a-special-report-unions-need-not-apply.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm\">told</a> <em>The New York Times</em> in 1999, when the idea of voluntary 70-hour work weeks with no overtime shocked a more union-friendly America. \u201c\u2018Everything I want is offered to me here.\u201d</p><p>Today, America\u2019s most prominent companies are known more for their ostentatious luxuries than when Henry Ford <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/03/04/the-story-of-henry-fords-5-a-day-wages-its-not-what-you-think/\">had to over-pay his workers</a> for painfully monotonous work. Near dictatorial conditions in the old assembly line stripped workers of their autonomy. The management philosophy was based on a fundamental distrust in workers.</p><p>An \u201cover-foreman is to smooth out the difficulties which arise between the different types of bosses who in turn directly help the men,\u201d wrote the godfather of hierarchical manager Frederick Taylor. \u201cIf two of these bosses meet with a difficulty which they cannot settle, they send for their respective over-foremen, who are usually able to straighten it out. In case the latter are unable to agree on the remedy, the case is referred by them to the assistant superintendent.\u201d A neatly-stacked chain of command was designated a point-person for every conflict or confusion, which workers were apparently incapable of handling themselves.</p><p>In contrast, at Facebook, workers are actively encouraged to pursue their own interests. \u201cTeams are small and have a lot of autonomy, and it\u2019s amazing to see how much of a difference a single person can make at this place,\u201d <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Facebook-RVW2068024.htm\">gushed</a> another Facebook employee. Indeed, in the \u201ccons\u201d section, it is the lack of control that causes concern.</p><p>\u201cThe downside having so much going on all at once is that it takes energy and discipline to stay focused on those things that matter most. You need to embrace this challenge to get the most out of your experience,\u201d admitted the same worker.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s recognition comes the very same week that America is reassessing its relationship with unions. Michigan became the 24th state to adopt the highly contentious <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/11/us/right-to-work-q-and-a/\">right-to-work</a>\u00a0legislation, which makes it illegal to require union membership or fees (significantly reducing their ranks and revenue). The new law in the once union stronghold of Michigan piles on the problem of dwindling membership, from 17 percent private-sector membership in 1983 to just 7 percent today.</p><p>As more and more businesses incorporate Silicon Valley-style mass innovation into their core management practices, it\u2019s unclear whether employees will face the same authoritarian conditions that fueled demands for unions. As Thomas Friedman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/1778214/thomas-friedman-united-states-innovate-or-else\">points out in his latest book</a>, <em>That Used To Be Us</em>, everyone from soldiers to lawyers to assembly line workers are increasingly required to spend part of their time innovating. \u201cWhere change is happening quickly, who best sees the openings, opportunity, and necessities of change? It\u2019s not always the CEO,\u201d said Friedman.</p><p>Where technology demands more innovation from the front lines, employees may necessarily gain the benefits, discretion, and creativity that unions long hoped for.

The six-week program on Google+ includes virtual field trips to NASA, CERN, and Disney Imagineering plus the opportunity to make tensile strength towers, glowing candy and potato canons.</p><p>Each day <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://makezine.com/maker-camp/\">Maker Camp</a> kids join counselors on a new project or field trip and use Google Hangouts to get advice and share their experiences. Campers can join from home on their desktops and via mobile, and \u2014 new this year \u2014 they can visit a local Make Camp affiliate site, such as a library, where they can congregate in person. Google hopes the campers will share photos and videos of their creations on its social network <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MAKE/posts\">Google+</a>.</p><p>Despite Google\u2019s recent real-world hardware endeavors like self-driving cars and Google Glass, its roots are in the intangible world of ones and zeros. So it partnered with Make magazine, leaders of the maker movement that encourages do-it-yourself science and art projects. Maker\u2019s Bay Area event saw 120,000 attendees in 2013, and Make magazine has a readership of 300,000.</p><p>Dale Dougherty, founder of Maker Faire and Make Magazine, explains that the virtual summer camp \u201cisn\u2019t a textbook. It\u2019s not like \u2018let\u2019s learn about velocity.\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018let\u2019s build cars and rockets and figure out what makes them go faster.\u2019 We\u2019re trying to figure out a set of experiences that gets you interested in science.\u201d</p><p>At the kickoff event at San Francisco\u2019s Exploratorium, I watched a few young campers race boats they built from two-liter soda bottles. As they learned fluid dynamics and rotor technology through trial and error, the smiles on their faces illuminated the potential for a more participatory approach to science education.</p><p>One camper, Isaac, told me he decided to join the program after creating a Tesla coil as part of a young makers club. When I asked why he wanted to attend Maker Camp he explained that \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019d probably just be sitting around playing video games.\u201d</p><p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-843566\" alt=\"Isaac Maker Camper\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/isaac-maker-camper.jpg?w=229&amp;h=300\" width=\"229\" height=\"300\">Not designing video games, not building a tree house.

Students do \u201clabs\u201d, but they\u2019re often just following heavily scripted sets of instructions rather than testing their own hypotheses.</p><p>That\u2019s a shame, because the real scientific process is a lot more fun, and those foundational experiences with tinkering can turn kids into serious engineers down the road.</p><p>Dougherty tells me the whole point of Maker Camp is \u201cto see yourself as a producer, a creator, and think of science as something you get to do things with. It starts with silly stuff but grows into more meaningful things. Science is changing the world around us and we\u2019re either part of it or subject to it. I want to infect kids with the kind of gene that has them saying \u2018I want to get my hands on this.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s much different from what Isaac tells me his science class is like. \u201cAll the testing.

Thomas writes that if he succeeds in crowdfunding the production, Warner Bros. (which owns the rights) has agreed to distribute the film.</p><p>It\u2019s a sign that major media companies are taking Kickstarter more seriously. And if this works out, it might become a model for studios to resurrect other properties with small-but-passionate audiences \u2014 the obvious choice among Internet geeks is probably\u00a0<em>Firefly</em>, and I\u2019m also rooting for\u00a0Thomas\u2019 other beloved-but-canceled show <em>Party Down</em>.

In the years since, Thomas has talked about bringing it back as a movie, \u00a0but he writes, \u201cWarner Bros. wasn\u2019t convinced there was enough interest to warrant a major studio-sized movie about Veronica and the project never got off the ground.\u201d</p><p>Now, if the campaign gets funded, the plan is to shoot the movie this summer and release early next year, with a limited theatrical run followed by digital distribution. Prizes range from a PDF of the script to a speaking role as a waiter or waitress in the movie.

When assessing the build versus buy equation and the difficulty finding OpenStack engineering talent, buying often makes the most sense.</p><p>It gives these companies like Cisco and IBM the talent they desire and some nice intellectual property to go with it.</p><p>OpenStack is a six-year-old open source computing platform, originally conceived as a check to the growing power of Amazon cloud computing services. It provides an open way to create public and private clouds (though it\u2019s currently mostly used for private ones) and includes all of the services a modern cloud computing platform would require, with core features like compute, storage and networking, as well as numerous\u00a0ways to easily run popular software packages like Hadoop and technologies like containers on top of it.</p><p>As it has grown in popularity in recent years, it has caught the attention of the technology giants, as\u00a0they\u00a0as they jockey for position and try to grab a piece of the OpenStack pie and clients who would need to run complex private clouds. Just last month for instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/05/07/oracle-openstack-nebula/\">Oracle snagged\u00a040 former Nebula employees</a> from the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/02/openstack-market-consolidation-continues-as-nebula-shuts-its-doors/\">shuttered startup</a> to beef up its OpenStack effort.

The reason he felt this way was the corporatization of the project, which the purchase of the company he helped found clearly\u00a0illustrates.</p><p>Piston\u2019s main <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/07/mesosphere-releases-first-data-center-os-and-announces-36m-in-funding/\">product is CloudOS</a>, which is\u00a0an operating system for OpenStack. Its primary benefit is that it\u00a0provides a way to manage server clusters as a single pool of resources, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/07/mesosphere-releases-first-data-center-os-and-announces-36m-in-funding/\">not unlike Mesosphere.</a></p><p>Blue Box is a managed cloud provider built on OpenStack and IBM sees it as a way to accelerate its hybrid cloud strategy, an area it believes it can dominate. The Blue Box purchase will help customers deploy data and applications across different cloud environments.</p><p>As the OpenStack project has grown, a huge ecosystem of startups has built up around it. Unfortunately for these young companies, the ecosystem itself hasn\u2019t kept up the pace, and adoption has been slower than hoped.</p><p>Even though there were some great examples from Comcast and Walmart being\u00a0paraded at the most recent OpenStack Summit in Vancouver, there are companies still dabbling, experimenting or hanging back. OpenStack is a great idea, that\u2019s been difficult to implement.</p><p>For startups, the ecosystem simply isn\u2019t growing fast enough, so some consolidation is inevitable. The ones that can wait out this current fallow period are those that only look at OpenStack as a secondary source of income (think storage and networking companies that already have non-OpenStack products and customers). Others who have bet the house on OpenStack, including the likes of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mirantis.com/\">Mirantis</a>, are now at risk of being acquired before the market \u2014 and their potential \u2014 fully matures.</p><p>The big companies like Cisco and IBM can take advantage of the slow pace of adoption to buy these companies and build their OpenStack chops in the process. The ultimate hope is that companies will be willing to take a chance with OpenStack with big names they know, rather than small startups.</p>", "title": ["Piston Goes To Cisco, Blue Box to IBM As OpenStack Consolidation Accelerates"], "author": ["Ron Miller", "Frederic Lardinois"]},

It\u2019s a terrific product,\u201d says\u00a0Rudenstine. \u201cBut our whole vision for maps from day one \u2014 when Elliot approached me and said he had this loony idea to create a new map \u2014 is that maps should be more than just utilities that help you get from point A to point B.\u201d He likens the idea for a collaborative map to the rest of the social web, where users find and follow others, and where maps become live and dynamic.</p><p>To be clear, CityMaps are not collaborative in the sense that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\">OpenStreetMap</a>\u00a0is, meaning user-built maps of the streets and landmarks around you. OpenStreetMap, however, serves as one the product\u2019s data sources, among others like\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.naturalearthdata.com/\">Natural Earth</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.factual.com/about\">Factual</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.neustar.biz/infoservices/solutions/localeze/local-search-platforms/listings-optimizations#.UfqvX2RATsk\">Localeze</a>, as well as some data from strategic relationships CityMaps has made with Fortune 100 companies, which it\u2019s not allowed to disclose. So rather, CityMaps\u2019 collaborative functions are not about building the map itself, but live as a layer on top of the basic mapping data.\u00a0The idea is that users can build their own maps of what matters to them, such as lists of favorite restaurants or stores, perhaps. In addition, it means that friends can suggest places they should add to their lists, too.</p><p>After raising $3.5 million over a couple of rounds of funding, the company launched what it now refers to as its \u201cproof of concept\u201d application in early 2012 \u2014 the fastest <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product\">MVP</a>\u00a0it could put on the market to test whether or not the consumers would be interested in such an idea. This early version of CityMaps worked in just five cities \u2014 New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston and Austin \u2014 where it gained \u201cmany hundreds of thousands\u201d of users, though less than a million.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/01/citymaps-announces-1-5m-in-additional-series-a-funding-from-a-grade-investments-endecas-founder-others/citymaps-05-add-to-map/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-855393\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-855393\" alt=\"Citymaps-05-add-to-map\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/citymaps-05-add-to-map.png?w=274&amp;h=384\" width=\"274\" height=\"384\"></a>But the engagement levels were high enough for the company to push forward \u2013 over half (55 percent) of users were opening the app multiple times per week, the company found. The app also received good feedback, even winning the recommendation of the City of NY Dept. of Tourism, and gaining a deal which saw it replacing Microsoft\u2019s mapping software in 7,000 NYC taxis this January.</p><p>With the redesigned, revamped iOS app (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/01/citymaps-launches-official-ios-app-that-aims-to-make-mapping-social/\">product review here</a>), CityMaps now includes over 15 million business locations across the U.S., allowing it to work anywhere, not only in its originally supported, nearly half a dozen cities.</p><p>The company\u2019s local data set includes the business name and location, as well as other information a user would want to know, such as the menu at a local restaurant, what kinds of clothes a clothing stores sells, when happy hour is, and more.</p><p>In the near future, CityMaps will be rolling out a system to help users see more about what\u2019s currently happening at all these venues, too.</p><p>Explains\u00a0Rudenstine, this system, due out in just a few weeks, will leverage the company\u2019s partnership with business listings service <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yext.com/\">Yext</a>. This\u00a0will enable local business owners to post real-time messages about whatever it is they have to promote to CityMaps, along with all the other services Yext currently supports.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/01/citymaps-announces-1-5m-in-additional-series-a-funding-from-a-grade-investments-endecas-founder-others/citymaps-04-profile-map-open/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-855392\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-855392\" alt=\"Citymaps-04-profile-map-open\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/citymaps-04-profile-map-open.png?w=274&amp;h=384\" width=\"274\" height=\"384\"></a>Launch partners for the new in-map communication and recommendations feature set include Bliss Spa, Aeropostale, Gansevoort Hotel Group and Morgans Hotels (hotel chains), The Vitamin Shoppe, Bond New York, StyleCaster Media Group, and Time Out. Other businesses will also be able to claim their own venues and manage their events and communications in the near future, as well.</p><p>Also coming soon is CityMaps\u2019 bigger plans for map personalizations. After users sign in via Facebook, or later connect their social accounts like Facebook or Foursquare, CityMaps will be able to access their profile and/or check-in data to begin making some simple judgment calls about the kinds of things a user likes. As the user continues to engage with the product, CityMaps\u2019 ability to refine those earlier judgment calls then improves.</p><p>\u201cOur whole vision is that no two maps should be the same,\u201d Rudenstine says. \u201cWhen you pull up CityMaps, you should see a collection of logos that represent\u2026businesses that CityMaps deems are relevant to you,\u201d he explains. \u201cAt the most basic level, the personalization engine matches what we know about the businesses to what we know about you.\u201d</p><p>Finally, in addition to the forthcoming launch of the personalization engine and recommendations, CityMaps is building out its API for developers, which would allow them to use CityMaps data in their own products. For instance, if Airbnb homeowners wanted to make a map for their guests of nearby restaurants and stores, they could use CityMaps to do so instead of Google. (Airbnb is <em>not</em> a partner on this, it\u2019s just an example \u2013 but it is an A-Grade investment, so who knows). The company is also in discussions with OEMs, and will have announcements surrounding their adoption of the API soon, too.</p><p>There\u2019s been a renewed interest in companies building mapping startups, following Apple\u2019s booting of Google from its list of pre-installed apps for a map app of its own, not to mention the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/11/its-official-google-buys-waze-giving-a-social-data-boost-to-its-location-and-mapping-business/\">$1.1 billion acquisition of social traffic map Waze</a> by Google, which not only helped its own interests in mapping, but also kept that data out of Apple\u2019s hands.</p><p>CityMaps seems to think it\u2019s now onto the next big thing in mapping with its personalization efforts, but it\u2019s difficult to ignore the giant in the room, Google. With Google\u2019s ever-expanding Google+ initiative, it could choose to light up maps with more collaborative and personalized features as well, by tapping into all the data it already knows about businesses and users alike.</p><p>But Rudenstine is hopeful, saying that the recent events have changed the way people think about maps. \u201cPeople are now beginning to realize the importance of having a map,\u201d he\u00a0says. \u201cThe story of maps hasn\u2019t yet been written.\u201d</p>", "title": ["CityMaps Announces $1.5M In Additional Series A Funding From A-Grade Investments, Endeca\u2019s Founder & Others"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

Of course, it\u2019s a bit of a challenge to know when to make a move and buy tickets exactly.</p><p>The main problem with buying tickets on secondary markets is that you have no clue if they reached their lowest price already or if you should be well off exercising some patience and let the price drop a bit more. Enter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.seatgeek.com/\">SeatGeek</a>, launching at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://techcrunch50.com\">TechCrunch50</a> conference today, which offers a service that basically forecasts ticket prices on secondary markets so you can make educated decisions on when to break out your wallet.</p><p>SeatGeek developed a bot that crawls hundreds of secondary market websites every day to aggregate information on transactions like the amount of money tickets are going for and other factors that have an effect on pricing. The startup actually takes into account a very broad set of relevant factors. For instance, when they track baseball games they not only trace the prices of tickets but also if the game was on a weekend, what the weather was like, who was pitching and so on.</p><p>SeatGeek can go over this multitude of records in their database and analyze historical price points for events, enabling them to forecast what the pricing pattern for secondary tickets is going to look like for future similar events. Buyers can sign up to get notified when the price drops to the rock bottom as predicted by their system and simply purchase only once it does. And the good thing is even sellers can benefit from the forecasting model because they can use it to determine when they should be unloading their tickets.</p><p>SeatGeek offers a free version for buyers and will soon release a premium version for brokers and other sellers. SeatGeek also gets 7 to 10% of ticket sales thanks to affiliate relationships with ticket brokers. They\u2019re also preparing the roll-out of a \u2018ticket insurance\u2019 product, where users get compensated if SeatGeek doesn\u2019t provide accurate forecasts.</p><p><strong>Expert panel Q&amp;A:</strong></p><p>Q \u2013 Roelof Botha: I like it, like I like Farecast (which did pretty well). Is your goal to become the primary site to go to to get tickets, and wouldn\u2019t that hurt the brokers?</p><p>A: we\u2019re helping them, we\u2019re doing marketing for them. We\u2019ve spoken to them and they\u2019re supportive of what we\u2019re doing.</p><p>Q \u2013 Paul Graham: What percentage can you predict, e.g. baseball games?</p><p>A: In average, 40% of baseball games that are sold out. Overall, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re directionally correct 80% of the time.</p><p>Q \u2013 Marc Andreessen: How high is up? How big can it get?</p><p>A: The size of the secondary ticket market, $15 billion a year.</p><p>Q \u2013 Paul Graham: why do you make a consumer website, why not use it and resell tickets yourself?</p><p>A: We thought about it, but the downside is the initial capital injection. Half the battle is acquiring tickets, brokers are good at it and we\u2019re not it, so we focus on providing tools to help them and buyers. We think the opportunity is bigger by not doing it ourselves and letting consumers use our tools.</p><p><strong>Video:</strong></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/2163105\">http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/2163105</a></p><p><strong>Pictures:</strong></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/42475850@N03/sets/72157622243128113\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/seatgeek-flickr.jpg\"></a></p><p><strong>Extra coverage:</strong><br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://digital.venturebeat.com/2009/09/14/tc50-seatgeek-tells-you-when-to-buy-tickets/\">TC50: SeatGeek tells you when to buy tickets</a> VentureBeat.<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/ariel-schwartz/sustainability/seatgeek-lets-ticket-buyers-fight-back-against-ticketmaster\">SeatGeek: A Prediction Market for Concert and Sports Tickets</a> FastCompany.<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gearpatrol.com/blog/2009/09/18/seatgeekcom/\">Ticket Buying Gets All Smart Like</a> Gear Patrol.<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sheblogs.org/2009/09/seatgeek-com-launches/\">SeatGeek.com Launches (Live from TC50)</a> SheBlogs.</p>", "title": [], "author": []},

The firm has discussed the possibility of growth-stage funding with external parties, but this is not at all finalized. </p><p>Second, it would definitely not involve any kind of Series A or B investments because of the signaling risk problem (e.g. companies that don\u2019t get follow-on funding would have a much harder time raising funds from other investors). </p><p>A potential Y Combinator growth-stage fund would be much farther down the line, akin to Series E funding or growth capital that a company might need before going public. Think about it as being competitive with the kinds of firms that might invest in Airbnb at north of the $10 billion valuation. </p><p>If they were going to do it, they would think about how they could re-invent the category above and beyond offering commodity capital before an IPO. For instance, companies at this stage have this dual need to raise huge amounts of money to fuel growth <em>and</em> to provide liquidity to early employees.

When you first open the Easilydo app, it suggests connecting with your Facebook account and your iPhone Address Book. If you do that, the app starts pulling in data and creating a list of tasks, such as telling someone \u201chappy birthday!\u201d and sending them a Facebook Gift, sending congratulations to your friends for good news and condolences for bad news, and merging duplicate contacts in your address book.</p><p>As you connect more services, you can also do things like track shipments, jump on conference calls (Easilydo will even dial the conference password for you), and get reminders about when you should leave for your next meeting (plus send messages if you\u2019re going to be late).</p><p>Looked at individually, none of these tasks seems all that impressive (particularly the birthday wishes, which are the most popular task). But the Easilydo team makes them easy to accomplish \u2014 Berner said every job in the app can be done in one screen \u2014 and it aggregates them all in one place, rather than make you go from app to app. So if you\u2019ve got a few minutes to kill, you can just open Easilydo and work down the list. Afterwards, you can feel all smug about your productivity by looking at a list of the tasks you\u2019ve already accomplished. Easilydo also drives home the convenience idea by telling you how many minutes you\u2019ve saved by using the app.</p><p>The company initially tested the product with a Canadian release, and it\u2019s launching in the U.S. today. Berner said Easilydo plans to expand the number of tasks the app can accomplish, both by building new functionality itself and by recruiting outside developers.

The tiny pilot of algebra and statistics courses will be limited to just 300 students, half from SJSU and half from high schools and community colleges.</p><p>The California Teachers Association has yet to take a stance on the pilot, but at least one faculty member suspects the announcement was timed to subvert opposition. \u201cMy personal opinion is that it\u2019s not by accident that this is being announced at a time when most faculty are not on campus, but I have no evidence for that,\u201d said Sociology Professor, Preston Rudy, \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about Udacity to take any position, but over all, I know the university is concerned about who will teach courses if they go online, who has control, and whether they will be university employees.\u201d</p><p>While faculty worry about the quality of online courses, the truth is that our education system, primarily designed to test rote memorization, is built to scale and be independent of teacher interaction.

After former University of California President, Richard Atkinson, threatened to drop the SAT from admissions requirements, the College Board rushed to revamp the test for the entire country only a year after the threat. However goes California\u2019s education system, so goes the nation.</p><p><strong>If I had to predict how the fallout of this pilot will go, here\u2019s my timeline</strong>:</p><p>The impact of Udacity\u2019s program is a rose or thorn depending on how much value you put into higher education. If you fall into investor Peter Thiel\u2019s camp, who famously funds young entrepreneurs to skip college, then this is good news, as it might funnel more young people into vocational careers, save them thousands in debt, and expand educational access.

The model is straightforward \u2013 Samasource works with companies that need certain types of relatively simple tasks done, like database cleanup, translations, transcriptions, etc. Samasource charges companies on a per action basis, and then pays workers in Kenya, Uganda, India, Pakistan and Haiti to do the work.</p><p>The tasks are generally more complicated than Mechanical Turk stuff, and the company pays a minimum of $1/hour to workers who were previously living on less than $3/day. Some workers, who build up to more complex tasks, make as much as $10/hour.</p><p>And what\u2019s more important is that these workers develop a long term relationship with Samasource. They work via local companies that organize and hire the workers and do quality control, and that model seems to work. Today the company has 800 workers in various countries and wants to scale that up significantly. CEO <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/leila-chirayath-janah\">Leila Janah</a> says there is an infinite amount of labor available at a few dollars per hour, and that these jobs make a huge difference in the lives of the workers. There are 4 billion people living on less than $3/day, she says, and $1.4 billion living on less than $1/day.</p><p>They are building slowly because they don\u2019t want to lay people off if there\u2019s no work, so part of their job is to find long term customers with a steady work flow. They recently signed a $450,000 contract with a new customer that will allow them to hire another 200 or so workers, for example. To date Samasource has made $1.2 million in gross revenue, and all but 15% or so of that was distributed to workers.</p><p>Samasource is, like <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org\">Kiva</a>, a non profit organization. What this company really needs is to get a large government or other grant to try to scale their work. A large part of Janah\u2019s time seems to be spent on chasing that money, and a few million dollars as a grant would go a long way to providing thousands of people with work. Or, Samasource could turn into a for-profit entity and raise more traditional venture capital for growth.

While in Austin for SXSW Interactive, Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and star Will Arnett took a few minutes out of their busy, busy, extremely important lives to answer a few questions about the show. So what\u2019s it like being a big star on TV and then putting your face on the Internet instead?</p><p>Arnett said it was \u201cvery exciting\u201d to be using the Internet to deliver the show to its fans. In part that\u2019s because that\u2019s where the fans are, according to Hurwitz. At least, when compared to premium cable or other distribution networks.</p><p>\u201cFor this show, which has always taken some risks with the form, it just seemed great to take a risk with the delivery system, too. Which has only been used, as I understand it, for pornography,\u201d Hurwitz explained. Later he clarified that there wasn\u2019t much difference in distribution between Arrested Development on broadcast TV and how it\u2019ll be shown on Netflix.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think of it as being on the Internet\u2026 Any more than I think of being on TV as being on electricity,\u201d Hurwitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s still going to be an experience where people are going to watch a show, and they\u2019re probably going to be watching it on a TV. The fact that it\u2019ll be distributed by the Internet versus cable hasn\u2019t changed the way we made the show.\u201d</p><p>Of course, being on the Internet means a different way of thinking about viewership and ratings. Netflix doesn\u2019t plan on releasing any sort of official ratings numbers for Arrested Development, or any of its other shows, for that matter \u2014 in part because it doesn\u2019t rely on a big one-time showing for advertisers.</p><p>That said, the Arrestsed Development guys expect huge viewership from the show\u2019s fans. How big? \u201cProbably a billion views a day,\u201d Arnett guesstimated. Hurwitz thought that estimate was low, expecting more like 7 or 8 billion views. What\u2019s that in Nielsen ratings? \u201cProbably about a 4\u201d in the demo they\u2019re looking at, Hurwitz quipped.</p><p>Check out my interview above, which was somehow chopped down from a crazy, 20-minute improv session that I couldn\u2019t keep up with most of the time. (Kudos to TechCrunch TV video producer Ashley Pag\u00e1n for making it work.) Maybe we\u2019ll have outtakes later.</p>", "title": [], "author": []},

Google, for instance, was part of a successful online protest against SOPA, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/our-position-on-californias-no-on-8.html\">failed at influencing</a> the outcome of the decidedly non-tech anti-gay marriage amendment in California.

The latest funding\u00a0brings the total investment to-date to $50M.</p><p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-1091596\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/2014-12-07_2116.png?w=464&amp;h=408\" alt=\"2014-12-07_2116\" width=\"464\" height=\"408\">Besides the funding though, the bigger news was the announcement\u00a0of their first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mesosphere.com/learn/\">data center operating system</a> (DCOS). This is a new kind of operating system that\u00a0operates on the scale of the entire data center, which means instead of controlling a single machine, the operating system\u00a0sits on top of the data center and enables administrators to treat all of the resources in the data center as a single, virtual entity. This allows for much simpler management and lets administrators spin servers and software up and down as needs require much more quickly than with current methods.</p><p>The virtual machine allowed you to make the best use of your resources on a single machine, but Mesosphere wants to take that concept a step further and allow you to apply that same principle to the entire data center. Because today\u2019s applications tend to work across multiple servers,\u00a0no matter how many ways you break down a single machine\u2019s resources, it\u2019s just not going to suffice anymore.</p><p>By applying\u00a0this virtual machine concept across the entire data center, you create a single pool of resources that you can manipulate any way that you like and this could be a powerful capability for system administrators.\u00a0What\u2019s more, this\u00a0ability to virtualize the entire data center\u00a0dramatically speeds up the time it takes to spin up server clusters from days or weeks to hours or even minutes, depending on how large the cluster is you are trying to create.</p><p>The virtual resource pool is designed to span thousands of machines. In fact, Mesosphere\u00a0mentioned a reference customer running 50,000 nodes on DCOS, and they believe they can scale to 500,000 nodes by\u00a0the end of next year.</p><p>Administrators can operate the DCOS from a command line or use a graphical user interface to\u00a0quickly drag and drop resources from a library to the command line panel. This \u00a0gives administrators\u00a0the ability to start multiple instances of any software in the library very quickly. The library includes popular open source products by default such as\u00a0Apache Spark, Apache Cassandra, Apache Hadoop and Google Kubernetes,\u00a0or customers can add internal software packages.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1091526\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/mesosphere-dcos-2.png?w=680&amp;h=359\" alt=\"mesosphere-dcos-2\" width=\"680\" height=\"359\"></p><p>DCOS\u00a0is compatible with several versions of Linux including Redhat, CentOS, Ubuntu, and CoreOS, as well public cloud infrastructure services from companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Finally, you can use it with private cloud infrastructure services including\u00a0virtual machines, bare metal and OpenStack.</p><p>Administrators can also set up triggers with a\u00a0scheduler tool so that when certain conditions are met, the system will automatically run a pre-defined set of commands. For instance, administrators could run a set of commands based on cost, so the job would only run if the cost threshold were\u00a0met.\u00a0What\u2019s more, administrators can take advantage of the API to build applications against the single pool of data center resources available from\u00a0Mesosphere DCOS.</p><p>Mesosphere said DCOS\u00a0will be generally available next year, but there is an early access program now.</p>", "title": ["Mesosphere Announces First Data Center OS And $36M In Funding"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},

Just when you\u2019re thinking EMC might be irrelevant, it makes a move that suggests the company is still forging ahead.</p><p>While <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.emc.com/index.htm\">EMC</a> is at its core a storage company, it owns lots of enterprise pieces\u00a0and works in such as areas as the cloud, big data, security and content management. Yet a substantial percentage of the company\u2019s market cap derives from its 80 percent ownership stake in VMware. In other words, if EMC joined the parade of companies breaking in two, and it spun off VMware,\u00a0it would be left a modest sized company.</p><p>Cloudscaling is one more attempt to stay current giving it a company that provides an OpenStack infrastructure play, one that is in heavy demand. Much like its partnership with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pivotal.io/\">Pivotal</a> and its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fiercecontentmanagement.com/story/emc-scoops-syncplicity-cloud-file-sharing-and-syncing-service/2012-05-21\">purchase of Syncplicity</a> a couple of years ago, Cloudscaling gives EMC some cache with IT folks who\u00a0are looking for something different, something you typically don\u2019t find at a large, established enterprise vendor like EMC.</p><p>As Andreessen Horowitz COO Scott Kupor pointed out in a recent blog post,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://a16z.com/2014/10/14/what-all-the-recent-tech-company-splits-say-about-the-future-of-cloud-computing/\">stand-alone companies such as Akamai, Cisco, EMC, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and HP are showing signs of age</a> with slower organic growth, and these companies are using their cash reserves to buy the pieces they need, rather than developing them in-house. But in a market where the cloud evens the playing field and companies born in the cloud have far greater agility than these larger companies, suddenly being bigger isn\u2019t better anymore and these companies are stuck in a very difficult position.</p><p>They can split up as HP, eBay and Symantec have done in recent weeks\u00a0or they can try and move to the cloud, however clumsily, as all these players are doing. It\u2019s no coincidence that HP, IBM, Oracle and EMC have all turned to OpenStack as a life raft of sorts. They see the game changing and they are trying desperately to find a way to play along.</p><p>As Kupor pointed out in his post, this transition will not happen over night because these companies can live on their maintenance contracts for years and years and no large customer, whether it\u2019s the government or a large corporate entity\u00a0is\u00a0going to rip and replace over night\u00a0\u2013but the future is clear for anyone willing to look.</p><p>The cloud and digital transformation has become so compelling, it\u2019s impossible to ignore \u2013and their customers are beginning to make the transition. These large companies see it, but they are big and slow and it\u2019s hard to move a company from what you know to something entirely different, and while many are making the move, you have to wonder how many of these companies will be around in their current form by 2020.</p><p>I wrote about t<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/13/wayfair-and-hubspot-ipos-could-be-just-the-beginning-for-boston-startup-scene/\">he Boston startup scene the other day</a> and pointed out several waves of glory days that have come and gone in Massachusetts as whole generations of companies have disappeared that were once the stalwarts of the state\u00a0economy, whether we are talking Polaroid or the entire mini computer industry including Digital, Wang, Data General, Apollo and Prime. They are all gone now. Could EMC be next?</p><p>As I\u2019ve written before, disruption is not a fait accompli. Large companies have come off the mat, but we have also seen tidal waves of disruption wipe out companies that were once industry giants, and the thing about the cloud and digital transformation is it moves so much faster and the change comes so much more suddenly. Companies that can\u2019t move quickly can and will disappear at a startling rate.</p><p>EMC could be one of those companies at a crossroads. If it can\u2019t figure out how to become a different company (whatever that is), it may not be around forever, at least as we\u2019ve known it. Buying a company like Cloudscaling is one more move on the chess board and one more attempt to avoid the disruption steamroller.</p><p><em>Note: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-13/emc-acquiring-cloud-computing-startup-cloudscaling.html\">Bloomberg originally broke this story</a>.\u00a0</em></p>", "title": ["EMC Cloudscaling Purchase Is One More Attempt To Stay Relevant"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},

Early adopters don\u2019t mind getting their hands dirty with\u00a0the technology, but as the market matures, and the second wave of users comes along, they tend to want a simpler approach. The appliance provides a much cleaner way to get going with OpenStack</p><p>\u201cI believe that delivering a software solution as an appliance works better once a market is more mature and there is already a large demand for the software and people using it. I think it tends to be a better sale to late majority who don\u2019t have the technology chops to set things up themselves and want a \u201cplug and play\u201d approach. When Netezza came out, people already knew that they needed a data warehouse and were looking to get a top of the line one in an easily consumable form factor.

The idea is to give companies that same agility, scalability and flexibility you get from public cloud offerings, but instead of being on the open internet, it\u2019s inside a private data center. Metacloud actually also offers a hosted service in the cloud or a hybrid offering for those companies who want a combined offering (which is often the case).</p><p>To read Cisco\u2019s explanation of this deal\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=1489587\">in their release</a> is to get a long list of Cisco buzzwords, particularly that they want to add Metacloud to their \u201cglobal intercloud,\u201d whatever that means. Reading between the buzzwords though, it appears that Cisco wants a piece of the growing OpenStack action, and who can blame them?</p><p>These large companies surely understand that there is a lucrative market in the cloud, and they might not be able to build the tools and technologies they need, so they are buying them instead. In this case, Metacloud gives Cisco an instant OpenStack product to integrate into its cloud product suite. Let\u2019s not forget, it\u00a0was just last March that Cisco announced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2014/03/24/when-all-else-fails-promise-a-1b-cloud-investment-cisco-chimes-in/\">its obligatory promise to invest $1B in the cloud</a>. HP<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/hp-to-invest-1bn-in-open-source-cloud-computing-launches-helion-portfolio-7000029171/\">\u00a0made a similar announcement</a> in May.</p><p>Now both companies have invested in cloud startups within a week of each other. It\u2019s enough to make you believe they are actually competing with one another. Yet all three companies in this report -Rackspace, HP and Cisco -are struggling to gain traction in a highly competitive market.</p><p>When it comes to the cloud, the three public cloud giants\u2013AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure\u2013have a huge marketshare lead.

The company has 600 clients that include MTV, VH1 and Pivotal Tracker.</p><p>Blue Box will use OpenStack as a foundation to unify its automation and orchestration technology. It is a white glove service for companies that wish to outsource operations requiring specific expertise in managing the complexities of a programmed infrastructure. Blue Box also leverages Cloud Foundry, the platform as a service (PaaS), and Opscode, which enables companies to automate their infrastructures.</p><p>Companies are beginning to get a bit more comfortable with moving operations to services like Blue Box. What they need: a service that doesn\u2019t require a wholesale investment in one provider. In other words, a world that Oracle controls with its cloud-in-a-box options.</p><p>But what about the developers? Forward-looking companies will begin investing more in building developer communities and want some form of self-service infrastructure to host apps that fit their own ways of doing business. That\u2019s what differentiates Amazon Web Services (AWS) from a provider like IBM, which has some self-service capabilities but nothing like what a public cloud service offers.</p><p>OpenStack will provide the capability for self-service. For Blue Box, that\u2019s as much of a strategic move as anything else. OpenStack is the open infrastructure for building cloud environments. It holds promise as a way for companies to develop a cloud in the manner that fits their needs. For Blue Box that means offering a high level of service, automated infrastructure and open APIs for developers to deploy their own apps.</p><p>Blue Box has a lot of competition and that has to be its biggest challenge in the market, as it goes up against Dell, Rackspace, HP, AWS and a host of others.</p><p>But I like the combination that the company has put together.

And the process was extremely fast relatively speaking,\u201d says CEO\u00a0Faris Zaher.\u00a0\u201cFor a foreign investor coming into an unusual territory I think they were much faster than what a U.S.-based investor would have been. They\u2019re more of a global investor than some U.S.-based investors so they move faster in those territories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the end of the day, capital crosses borders easier than people \u2014 at least here in the Middle East. If you\u2019re a good company investors will find you, regardless of where you are,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re going after, and what most Middle Eastern startups are going after right now is mostly cloning models which have been proven to be successful elsewhere is actually going to require them to be based in the Middle East\u2026 And capital will flow in because you can\u2019t do this out of the Bay Area.\u201d</p><p>Yamsafer\u2019s booking platform focuses on\u00a0hotels in the Middle East and Turkey \u2014 catering to a region where, for cultural reasons, disruptive alternatives to traditional hotels\u00a0(such as\u00a0Airbnb) are\u00a0less strong, according to\u00a0Zaher.</p><p>\u201cAirbnb is very weak in the Middle East. I think it\u2019s probably one of its weakest markets, if not the weakest. Mostly because of cultural reasons \u2014 that business model does not work very well\u2026 Arab culture would not be very welcoming to renting out a room in your house or even renting out your entire house to strangers,\u201d he tells TechCrunch.</p><p>Yamsafer\u2019s main market is Saudi Arabia, which accounts for around 70 per cent of its transactions. Factor in the other Gulf countries and it\u2019s\u00a0around 90 per cent of its business.\u00a0Only around 10 per cent comes from the Levant and European travel coming into the Middle East.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been growing very fast over 2014 and we\u2019re still seeing that growth. We\u2019re now the second largest online booking service for hotels in terms of transaction volume after Booking.com,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe currently cover 18 countries and are focused on inter-regional travel mainly, so people traveling within their own country or from one Arabic country to another. And that\u2019s quite a large market.</p><p>\u201cAnnually the interregional travel market is $20 billion in hotel receipts. And the entire travel market is $50 billion. So you\u2019re talking about a very large market that\u2019s right now transitioning from booking through bricks and mortar travel agencies into online services.\u201d\u00a0<img class=\"alignright wp-image-1166630 size-full\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/unnamed1.png?w=358&amp;h=637\" alt=\"Yamsafer\" width=\"358\" height=\"637\"></p><p>Zaher says the main competitor for Yamsafer is Booking.com. It has followed the same platform model as its rival but with a tighter regional\u00a0focus, so it has localized maps and content, and offers things like cardless booking (to cater to travelers who don\u2019t have credit cards) and\u00a0telephone\u00a0booking (for those not yet fully comfortable booking online), as well as seeking out more of\u00a0the types of\u00a0properties that are popular with its target demographic.</p><p>\u201cThe average family size in Saudi is 11 people and when they travel they look for either very large rooms or to rent an entire villa or a chalet.

Android isn\u2019t far behind in smartphones, with 77 percent of interest, but trails considerably on tablets with 64 percent. The good news is that most developers are looking to build cross-platform apps instead of targeting just one, with 49 percent of respondents aiming for two platforms, and 31 percent going after three different operating systems.</p><p>Overall the interest in iOS and Android is pretty much unchanged from developer opinions\u00a0expressed\u00a0in the Q3 2012 Appcelerator/IDC survey, with Apple gaining two and four percentage points for iPhone and iPad respectively among devs who are \u201cvery interested\u201d in their platforms, and Android\u00a0losing\u00a0two points for tablets and\u00a0gaining\u00a0two for phones. But the big difference is in cross-platform interest, which sees 88.4 percent of mobile devs expressing intent to develop for two or more mobile platforms in 2013, vs. 68.9\u00a0percent\u00a0saying the same thing in the previous quarter.</p><p>Appcelerator and IDC break out interest in Nexus devices as its own\u00a0category, and that\u2019s where Android is seeing strong growth. 53.8 percent of developers said they were \u201cvery interested\u201d in targeting Nexus devices, which far outweighs the interest expressed in fully separate mobile platforms like BlackBerry and Windows Phone. Developers seem to see Google taking a stronger role in Android hardware, especially with tablets, as a positive thing, with 35.1 percent saying that other Android\u00a0manufacturers\u00a0should take the Nexus line as a model for their own devices going forward, vs. 26 percent saying Google is just another device maker, and only 7 percent expressing any kind of negative sentiment about how Google making hardware affects the overall ecosystem.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/nexus-survey-results.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-719420\" alt=\"nexus-survey-results\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/nexus-survey-results.png?w=680&amp;h=538\"></a>Other findings in the survey include a generally negative reaction by developers to Microsoft\u2019s Surface tablet, with most expressing the belief that despite delivering nice hardware, the tablet and Windows 8 need a lot of work before they can become truly successful. Windows tablets experienced a modest rise in developer interest, but still trailed far behind Nexus, Android and iPad categories.</p><p>Developers also expressed concern about Apple\u2019s recent hardware introductions, with only 19 percent agreeing that Apple has done enough to manage the fragmentation issues introduced by introducing new screen sizes as with the iPhone 5. And while the iPad mini retains the same resolution of the original iPad and iPad 2, developers still see reason to tailor designs to it, since the smaller physical screen means the relative size of touch targets shrink. 90 percent of developers also rated Apple as either equally or more difficult when it comes to the submission process, monetization and other issues, a sign Appcelerator and IDC interpret as an opening of the door for alternative platforms to gain more traction.</p><p>Finally, mobile developers saw it as likely that a mobile-first company could arise and disrupt big tech companies like Microsoft, Google and Facebook. Facebook especially looks vulnerable to a mobile-first social startup, according to survey respondents, with 62.4 percent of developers saying the network would lose its social dominance to a mobile-first competitor eventually. That\u2019s pretty close to what developers believed in the previous quarter (66 percent), despite Facebook launching a completely overhauled mobile strategy between the two. But of course, this survey is targeting mobile devs, many of whom could actually be working on (or know someone who\u2019s working on) what they believe will be a Facebook-killer, so it\u2019s worth taking that stat with a big grain of salt.</p>", "title": ["iPhone And iPad Continue To Reign Over Developer Interest, But Cross-Platform Apps Are Now On Everyone\u2019s Mind"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},

I hope that the 20 individuals he selects are wildly successful and create new companies that all of us will be amazed by. But I\u2019m not sure at the end of the day, what the experiment will prove. Many universities (Stanford included) have a number of undergraduates who drop out to start companies. Those individuals generally have a great technical idea and a passion to see that idea put into practice. Many of them fail, of course, as is true of all startups. But the students who drop out learn many life lessons and move on to either the next venture, or in some cases they return to school. A few succeed wildly\u2014and those are the extreme examples we all look at in amazement. Thiel\u2019s experiment will increase the probability of success for the students he selects because of the mentoring and the financial help they will receive. But most will still fail: such is the nature of starting a new company.</p><p>The more interesting question is what this experiment will teach us about the value of university education. My guess is that it will teach us very little. There is no control group. Why not pick 40 very bright young people and give half of them $100K to start a company and the other half $100K to stay in school and complete their education? Then track them over 5-10 years and see which group is more successful. Twenty is probably too small a number to draw any real conclusions from, even in such a controlled experiment, but it would be a better experiment than one without any controls.</p><p>The suggestion that students should bypass university education and jump immediately into the entrepreneurial world strikes me as equivalent to suggesting that all college athletes should simply play their sport for a couple of years, take no academic classes and then go on the NFL, the NBA etc. The vast majority of college athletes compete, and then they have careers in other fields.</p><p>Most young people I encounter, at Stanford and elsewhere, are not ready to start their own venture at 18 or even 20 years of age. Certainly there are a few outliers that we can all point to, but they are the rare exceptions rather than the rule. A university education gives the large majority the tools to become innovators and entrepreneurs throughout their lives. Engineering majors also get a technical education which will serve them well throughout their lives, whether or not they have a career in engineering. It would be a very good thing for this country if more of our doctors, lawyers and politicians had undergraduate training in engineering. They would think quantitatively and practically about how to solve problems, wherever their career might take them.</p><p>If universities, today, are not providing the kind of life skills that will serve their students well (a point I would debate), then universities should change what they are doing. In today\u2019s world, universities need to be held accountable for providing real value for the investment students or their parents make. In talking with very successful people in business and other fields, many of them attribute their success at least partially to skills they learned at their university. These skills were not always learned in the classroom. For many young people the years between 18 and 22 are their first experience away from home and they learn a lot about life from their university experience. I believe for most, what they learn is a cost effective investment.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-293612\" title=\"Duke--Pratt\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/duke-pratt.png?w=292&amp;h=55\" alt=\"\" width=\"292\" height=\"55\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-293613\" title=\"prattdean\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/prattdean.jpg?w=196&amp;h=166\" alt=\"\" width=\"196\" height=\"166\">Duke University Pratt School of Engineering dean <a href=\"http://www.pratt.duke.edu/from-the-dean\">Tom Katsouleas</a>:</p><p>First is the problem of argument by testimonial or individual example.\u00a0 By this argument, one could look around at lottery winners, and there are plenty of them.\u00a0 One could easily conclude that there is no reason to go to school or even to become an entrepreneur; all one needs to do is buy a lottery ticket.\u00a0 The corollary to that is that the statistics on entrepreneurial success don\u2019t bear out that it is better to drop out.\u00a0 Most successful entrepreneurs are not drop outs.\u00a0 It is just that the successful drop outs are newsworthy and get disproportionate media coverage.</p><p>Of course, the other reason one should not take Peter Thiel\u2019s advice is that the value of education is intrinsic and an end in itself rather than something to be measured by its career financial return.\u00a0 It is during one\u2019s undergraduate years that one discovers oneself, where one fits into the world and what it means to be human.\u00a0 Not to mention, there is value in the network of lifelong friends one makes and there is even measurable lifelong happiness associated with education according to studies by economists like Richard Easterlin.</p><p>Finally Thiel\u2019s question reminds me of a story of a high school teacher confronted with the same question from his students: \u201cWhy do we need to learn this?\u201d \u00a0The teacher replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t. \u00a0There is only one thing you need to learn to ask.\u201d \u00a0The piqued students implored him to tell what that was. \u00a0His answer: \u00a0\u201cWould you like fries with that?\u201d</p><p><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-293615\" title=\"Drexel\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/drexel.png?w=300&amp;h=54\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"54\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-293616\" title=\"Bruce Eisenstein\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/bruce-eisenstein.jpg?w=130&amp;h=170\" alt=\"\" width=\"130\" height=\"170\">Drexel College of Engineering dean <a href=\"http://www.drexel.edu/coe/news/archive/2010/Summer2010/bruceeisensteinnamedinterimcoedean/\">Bruce Eisenstein</a>:</p><p>For the very talented and very ambitious, dropping out is a good idea.

Unfortunately both came via sideloaded Android apps, likely created by the community using BlackBerry developer tools and the APKs of the Android apps in question. BlackBerry has made it very easy for any developer to port their Android titles to BB10 in around five to 10 minutes, but that means it\u2019s easy for anyone motivated enough to do so as well.</p><p>I spoke to BlackBerry\u2019s VP of Developer Relations Alec Saunders about the recent surfacing of both an <a title=\"There\u2019s No Native Instagram App For BlackBerry 10, But This Ported Android Version Gets The Job\u00a0Done\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/04/theres-no-native-instagram-app-for-blackberry-10-but-this-ported-android-version-gets-the-job-done/\">Instagram BAR file for sideloading on BB10 devices</a> (which Chris wrote about yesterday) and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.blackberryos.com/content/video-netflix-fully-functional-blackberry-z10-5414/\">Netflix app that BlackBerry OS demoed today</a>. Saunders made clear that BlackBerry doesn\u2019t officially sanction conversion efforts from anyone other than the official developer behind an app.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t condone piracy,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a license to distribute that app, that\u2019s effectively what it is. We think the best way for a developer to deal with that is to package the application themselves, turn it into a BAR file and put it into BlackBerry World, because users wouldn\u2019t be tempted to do that if the applications were simply available in BlackBerry World.\u201d</p><p>Saunders sees the eagerness of the community to get applications like Instagram and Netflix working on BB10 devices as a sign that there\u2019s demand there, and he thinks it is beginning to sway companies around to BlackBerry\u2019s side, too. WhatsApp is working on a BlackBerry port for its cross-platform messenger, for instance, and The New York Times is also working on a dedicated BB10 app. Saunders said both of those decisions have been made within the last six weeks, so clearly some minds are changing in terms of developer hold-outs.</p><p>\u201cIt is really, really easy to build a BAR file for an Android application and upload that to the store, so if it\u2019s easy for a developer to do that, it\u2019s easy for users to do that, too,\u201d Saunders said, discussing what BlackBerry can do about user-created apps. Only when those try to come into BlackBerry World itself and masquerade as legitimate apps can the company take action.</p><p>I also asked Saunders whether or not BlackBerry expected or predicted users would take matters into their own hands, since it works nicely as a stopgap measure while companies build their own solutions and helps prove there\u2019s a\u00a0demand\u00a0out there for those products. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we predicted it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd certainly we haven\u2019t made it easier for users to sideload applications on to our platform, but we\u2019ve been aware of it for some time.\u201d</p><p>The home port crowd is an interesting variable in RIM\u2019s platform launch. It energizes the\u00a0community, generates hype around apps that aren\u2019t yet\u00a0committed\u00a0to the platform, and shows off the ease with which Android APKs can be ported. BlackBerry may not officially approve, but it\u2019s hard not to see the value of this kind of\u00a0guerrilla\u00a0tactic in an admittedly uphill battle.</p>", "title": ["BlackBerry Community Wants Marquee Apps So Bad It\u2019s Porting Them DIY-Style \u2013 And BlackBerry Doesn\u2019t Approve"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},

While there\u2019s still no official version of Instagram for BlackBerry 10 devices, the folks at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:berrythai.com/how-to-install-instagram-on-your-z10/\">BerryThai</a> obtained and released a repackaged <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.blackberryos.com/content/working-instagram-bar-file-blackberry-10-leaked-5406/\">version of the app</a> ready to load onto a Z10 near you.</p><p>Before you get excited and run off to snap and share some ridiculous photos, know this: this is most definitely <em>not</em> a new, BlackBerry 10-centric version of Instagram, it\u2019s a port of a slightly older Instagram Android build. As such, you\u2019ll have to sideload the app onto your BlackBerry 10 device \u2014 it\u2019s not exactly a difficult process, but you do need to be least somewhat proficient with a command line (CrackBerry has some great guides for sideloading from a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crackberry.com/how-put-android-apps-your-blackberry-10-device\">Windows</a> or an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://crackberry.com/how-put-android-apps-your-blackberry-10-phone-your-mac\">OS X</a> machine)</p><p>As you\u2019d probably expect, the experience is hardly a perfect one. Snapping photos and sharing them seems to work just fine (though the Z10\u2019s camera doesn\u2019t always grab the best shots), but scrolling through the photo feed is an awfully sluggish affair and new users won\u2019t be able to create an account from within the app. For now though, this (or something like it) may be all that BlackBerry 10 devotees have to look forward to for now. According to a recent report from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130221/native-instagram-app-is-not-coming-to-blackberry-10/\">AllThingsD</a>, the Instagram team isn\u2019t particularly bullish on BlackBerry 10, with one unnamed source noting that they weren\u2019t sure a native version of the Instagram app would ever be released.</p><p>It\u2019s unclear how BerryThai managed to get a hold of the file in question, but the site\u2019s host shut the whole thing down not long after people started to notice what they had gotten their hands on. Instagram has reportedly been working on an Android port of the app for BlackBerry 10 for some time now (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/30/3933874/major-apps-instagram-blackberrys-next-big-score\">The Verge\u2019s Dieter Bohn</a> may have spotted it at the launch event once the theatrics were over), so it\u2019s possible that the .bar file BerryThai is peddling came from an internal source. Then again, it\u2019s also possible that an eager enthusiast did the conversion on their own, though the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.blackberryempire.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=26249#p26249\">track record</a> points to some difficulties on that front.</p><p>Frankly though, this version of Instagram is just enough of a headache to keep me from wanting to use it \u2014 hopefully whatever official version eventually gets released manages to clear up a few of these nagging issues.</p>", "title": ["There\u2019s No Native Instagram App For BlackBerry 10, But This Ported Android Version Gets The Job Done"], "author": ["Chris Velazco"]},

These attaches will work with the foreign governments to help eliminate in-country IP theft that is occurring. This is a net benefit to all Americans both IP holders and consumers. Also, the training and other programs that the attaches may provide can also help local law enforcement to deal with IP-infringement that is occurring.

Studio A has a strategy centered around making a big play on one game. It plans to take your investment and use it to make that game as best it can and find success. Studio B has a different idea. It plans to make many small games, build a platform and ecosystem between them and see which works. Then to accelerate what works to success.</p><p>Studio A\u2019s model is a deep bet on a single property. Studio B\u2019s model is a broad bet across the market. Which should you choose? Let me ask the question another way:</p><p>Suppose two technology startups approach you. Startup A has a strategy centered around making a big play on one product. It plans to take your investment and use it to make that product as best it can and find success. Startup B has a different idea. It plans to make many small products, build a platform and ecosystem between them and see which works. Then to accelerate what works to success.</p><p>Which is the smarter investment? You invest in Startup A because it has focus whereas Startup B does not. Startup A may well scale into operating multiple products one day, but early focus on a killer product is key. Startup B, on the other hand, is putting the cart before the horse. It will make a dozen crappy products, all of which will fail.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing. The second question is obvious for most tech investors. They\u2019ll always answer A. And yet (in my experience at least) when it comes to startups working in gaming, investor types tend to prefer answer B. But they are absolutely dead wrong.</p><p>I\u2019ve written this article to explain why.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying that games aren\u2019t risky investments. Of course they are. They\u2019re probably riskier than most tech investments because they rely more on the virtues of creativity and entertainment, two factors that are historically difficult to predict. Of course you might need that extra level of reassurance, that prototype or plan that explains how the game is to be developed in parts rather than all at once. Or that assurance that you have some great talent on the team who will bring the thing home. I get that.</p><p>What I am saying, on the other hand, is that tech investment communities (by which I mean the Valley, more traditional financiers and their various clones) harbor a mental image about games that tends to equate them to content. They see games on the same shelves as books, movies and music, and draw a line. Content expires. Content rarely has deep value. Content is often freer than it used to be. Content is an end-product with no opportunity to build one of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536\">Peter Thiel\u2019s monopolistic platforms</a>.</p><p>And what I\u2019m saying is that that image is wrong. Of course games are entertainment but they are also platforms, often monopolistic platforms. Increasingly so as the lines between online/offline, retail/service, single/multiplayer continue to blur. Over the years there have been numerous attempts to bring content-style financing to games but it has never worked. Games require a kind of development that isn\u2019t the same as the content model. They\u2019re usually much more like technology products. Every serious games business is not trying to build a game and then disband (like a movie). It\u2019s there to build 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 or 100 versions of the same game. Ad infinitum.</p><p>Granted that isn\u2019t the ambition of every game developer. Many indies, for example, relish starting over and always build new things in the manner of artists. However scalable games businesses are all built on the idea of making re-playable fun engines that will perpetuate. Just like Microsoft does with Windows or Oracle does. Far from investing in them along the publishing model, you should be investing in them as you would startups.</p><p>In any platform business the model is to build a great product, attract great users, drive great loyalty and then figure out a growth and revenue strategy from that. That\u2019s Uber, AirBnB, Tinder, Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Snapchat and Google. But that\u2019s also Minecraft, EVE Online, The Walking Dead, Moshi Monsters, League of Legends, Clash of Clans, Football Manager, Madden, Angry Birds, Magic: The Gathering, Game of War and many more.</p><p>Actually it\u2019s the general path to success for most studios \u2013 whether independent or as part of a larger company. Making a game is just as hard as making a product. With products the mechanics (what an app is supposed to do) are generally straight forward and the question becomes about whether the experience of using them is right. In games there\u2019s also the added dimension of whether the mechanics are fun, which can take a lot of experimentation to figure out. Focus is the key. And distraction from focus is bad.</p><p>This is why studios generally work on the same game year in, year out, selling to the same customers, growing their audience and raking in billions of dollars doing it. Just like Facebook keeps working on making Facebook better, Mojang keeps working on making Minecraft better, listening to its community, adding features and fixing bugs. Bungie keeps working on making Destiny better \u00a0CCP keeps working on making EVE Online better. And so on.</p><p>Granted some companies later go on to develop several franchises as publishers (like Activision, Nintendo or Glu, say). Similarly some are blessed by circumstance to make a big grab across a number of areas before it becomes clogged or expensive (Zynga, BigPoint). And in the Asian market some operators like Tencent have such a monopoly lock and a low quality expectation from players that being broad works. However that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll work for any startup studio today. Far from it.</p><p>Microsoft didn\u2019t start day one by committing to a dozen different software and OS applications any more than Apple started by making a computer, tablet, phone, music player and television streamer all at once. You would think that would be self-evident for games too, yet for some reason investors don\u2019t get it. They choose B.</p><p>I\u2019ve had a front row seat on the Studio B situation on more than one occasion. I\u2019ve seen several well-funded companies built on this model expire. Tragically so, indeed, because the people involved were great. But still they had the wrong model. Here\u2019s why they fail:</p><p>Studio Bs tend to spend a lot of money on back-end technology\u00a0and tools for products that they intend to work on one day. They tend to have a meta-pitch, like an innovative technology that they plan to leverage across all of their games and become the leaders in a space they imagine will exist. They say \u201cwe\u2019re not just making a game, we\u2019re changing gaming\u201d, which is a noble goal. But in almost every case what happens is they become <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html\">architecture astronauts</a>.</p><p>Their core technology, y\u2019see, is generally built pre-product and so its requirements are fuzzy. It\u2019s over-engineered, and in turn becomes a constraint preventing innovation on the products (the games). Whereas a small indie can chop and change their product quickly in response to player feedback, an architecture-obsessed Studio B often ends up spending an inordinate amount of time explaining why\u00a0things can\u2019t be done without breaking everything. So if things are going wrong they are unable to change course without massive pain. Sometimes not at all. And their core tech eventually needs to be pivoted anyway as actual requirements eventually intrude.</p><p>So Studio B\u2019s games are never as lean as they appear to be, always under-specced and take way too long to get to a basic playable state or meaningfully iterate to find their fun. And this is why they suck. Furthermore this is why Studio B\u2019s typically become clone-makers. Realizing that it\u2019s taking too long to make products or see meaningful change in them, they almost always end up rationalizing that what they need to do is carbon-copy something else. And that means they make shitty clones with zero prospect of gaining loyal fans. It\u2019s a vicious yet inevitable circle.</p><p>Even more than in the tech world, in the games world acquiring and inspiring loyal fans is essential. The audience is the key asset that every studio builds, not the technology. No audience, no customers, no free marketing channel, no revenue, no next release and next release and next release. Not realizing that is how you spend a lot of money and then go out of business.</p><p>Players in all markets expect the games they invest their time into to not be half-assed. Whether casual or core, indie or casino, it\u2019s the same. The axes that define \u201cassed\u201d vary from sector to sector but the principle is the same. Nobody likes a boring mealy-mouthed game. If you want your players to talk to their friends about the great game they\u2019re playing, for example, it can\u2019t just be a rip-off of something else.</p><p>Furthermore it\u2019s much harder to kill a product\u00a0once it\u2019s underway than it is to greenlight it in the first place. Tech investors already know this to be true in the world of startups. Once a startup scales to a certain level it will get into other product areas (like Google with maps, docs, mail and so on). People will be hired, offices rented, operating costs inflate and management too. But that has to happen at the right time, generally not at the beginning of a company\u2019s life, otherwise the startup risks being half-committed to a bunch of products that are never likely to work well. But said startups always promise that they will one day.</p><p>The exact same thing is true for games studios. Once you\u2019ve got multiple games on the go it\u2019s difficult to can any one of them. Every team working on every game believes that their\u2019s is The One, and will rationalize that until the end of time. The question becomes whether each game needs some extra investment to find its way, whether each is only half way to its potential, and the fear of failing at answering that question only intensifies. So Studio Bs end up like any bad software company juggling a variety of failing projects and never deciding to kill any of them.</p><p>Studio B, in other words, is a well-intentioned money pit.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen plenty of investors get very excited by that story that Angry Birds only cost $140k to make and that Zynga built the first version of FarmVille in two months, and worked with several CEOs who come to believe that solving how to make games for half that cost in 10% of the time is their number one priority. They often use the analogy of low-hanging fruit, of easy wins and analytics as a way to success. They tell that story so much that they eventually become believers, but\u00a0it leads to a tragic end.</p><p>Making games isn\u2019t panning for gold. I know there are a couple of examples of studios that did sort of do it that way and found success, but it far more commonly fails. Instead making games is like building a\u00a0service. It takes focus and diligence. I also know that sometimes that has resulted in over-bloated studios on ego trips that end up spending $100m and going nowhere. But that story is not the norm. Most of the time when talented studios are given the right conditions for success (focus, enough budget, time) they go on to make great things.</p><p>So, wonderful investor types, do you now understand? The next time someone comes to you with a proposal that promises a broad strategy and lots of low hanging fruit, pause and think. Do they have a game plan that starts with a real audience? Is whatever core tech underpinning their strategy real? Do they have a tangible plan for getting their first million users that doesn\u2019t start with buying a lot of installs? Are they making something deep?</p><p>If no, pass. Invest in Studio A instead.</p>", "title": ["Investing In Games: Broad Or Deep?"], "author": ["Tadhg Kelly"]},

Just over a week ago, furniture shopping service <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://betaboston.com/news/2014/10/01/a-big-week-for-boston-pillar-companies-wayfair-goes-public-will-start-trading-on-thursday/\">Wayfair went public and raised over $300M</a> in its IPO, then <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/09/hubspot-spikes-20-over-its-ipo-price-in-strong-debut/\">HubSpot had a successful IPO</a> of its own a week later. I think it\u2019s safe to say the Boston startup scene is on its way.</p><p>Scott Friend, a managing director at Boston-based venture capital firm Bain Capital says these successes bode well for Boston\u2019s startup community. \u201cFor sure, the HubSpot IPO, alongside other great IPOs and exits in town in recent years like Wayfair, DemandWare, Endeca and Kiva Systems (sale to Amazon.com for $775 million), enhances the credibility of the Boston start-up ecosystem for fledgling entrepreneurs as well as engineers and sales people, and investors. As we\u2019ve seen in Silicon Valley for several years, the big exits create a virtuous cycle in the local market that is contagious.\u201d</p><p>Of course, many outside the Silicon Valley might not know it, but Boston has an active startup scene even without the success of Wayfair, HubSpot and the others Friend mentioned, but these kind of big-number IPOs shine a spotlight on the city\u2019s startup system. In fact, there\u2019s a lot of action bubbling up in the Boston area right now and there is money there.</p><p>The Boston Globe started a website last year called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://betaboston.com/\">BetaBoston</a> to cover the burgeoning scene. I\u2019ve met with Bain Capital, which has funded many enterprise startups, many which now have offices within in blocks of its posh Hancock Tower offices. General Catalyst started in the Boston market, and has an office in Cambridge. And <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.xconomy.com/boston/resources/venture-capital-firms/\">there are scores of others</a>. There\u2019s also Fidelity Investments and Putnam Investments on the public market investment side. Private investors are also getting in on the act. For instance, I wrote about <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/fancred-gets-3m-to-continue-building-social-network-just-for-sports-fans/\">a social sports startup called FanCred</a> in August, which is headquartered in Boston and got early stage seed funding from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/linda-pizzuti-henry\">Linda Pizzuti Henry</a>, wife of Red Sox and Boston Globe owner John Henry. And that just scratches the surface of the money supply of things.</p><p>MIT and Harvard are huge engines for innovation and Kendall Square near MIT is busting at the seams with startups. There are incubators like MassChallenge and TechStars, and there is an area near South Boston previously all-but abandoned waterfront that the city has made into an innovation district with lots of startup action including the Mass Challenge headquarters. In short, there\u2019s a lot happening.</p><p>As TechCrunch writer Danny Crichton put it in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/04/as-the-valley-burns-up-boston-readies-its-next-act/\">a recent article on the Boston area startup scene</a>, \u201c\u2026there are many here in Boston who believe that the region\u2019s best times remain in its future, and that there is an opportunity to reinvent the city around deep, engineered technologies.\u201d</p><p>Mark Andreessen once famously talked about a thousand Silicon Valleys. What he meant was there should be more than one place in the world with a startup ecosystem and we are certainly seeing that in Boston, New York, Berlin and other cities throughout the world. Each of these cities has its own startup scene complete with incubators, funders, startup spaces and of course lots of companies vying for fame and fortune (looking for a pot of gold). They may not be as large with as much money as the Silicon Valley, but they have the pieces in place to grow.</p><p>Boston is one such scene, but let\u2019s not forget though that Boston has always been a hot-bed for this\u00a0type of innovation in large part because of the first-class universities here. It has just ebbed and flowed. Early on there was Polaroid and don\u2019t forget that for a time Route 128 was the mini computer capital of the world as companies like Digital Equipment Corporation, Wang, Apollo, Data General and Prime ruled the day. EMC came later.</p><p>Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer met at Harvard. Dan Bricklin developed the first spreadsheet <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa010199.htm\">VisiCalc</a> at Harvard. Mark Zuckerberg wrote the first version of Facebook at Harvard.</p><p>Companies launched by MIT graduates include Bose, Akamai, iRobot ZipCar and the aforementioned HubSpot. On and on it goes. And that\u2019s just the two of the more\u00a0famous universities. There are 35 colleges, universities and community colleges within the city limits and many more spread throughout the state including 5 University of Massachusetts locations along with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mass.gov/veterans/education/mass-univ-college/state-colleges-and-universities.html\">other state colleges and universities and community colleges</a>.</p><p>And that provides a lot of smart young people with great ideas, and much like you see in Silicon Valley as groups like Y Combinator and others try to encourage the next group of entrepreneurs, that\u2019s exactly what MassChallenge is doing, a group that gives young companies space and resources for a few months in a competitive environment that encourages these companies to grow up in a hurry with the lure of cash, services and funder recognition.</p><p>MassChallenge CEO John Harthorne says he\u2019s hopeful the two big IPOs are the beginning of something much bigger for the Boston startup scene. \u201cMaybe the rest of the country will finally realize what we\u2019ve known all along \u2013that Boston is the best place in the world in which to launch a high-impact startup,\u201d Harthorne wrote\u00a0me in an email.</p><p>One sign of a vibrant startup is how many of its alumni are working at other startups, and HubSpot actually brags about this on<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/company-news/hubspot-alumni-spotlight\"> their Alumni Spotlight page</a>. In sports successful coaches breed successful coaches and the same goes in startups. HubSpot alums are working at 25 startups and now that HubSpot and Wayfair are flush with their IPO cash, it\u2019s possible\u00a0that they could start investing their own money in other Boston startup projects \u2013and keep the innovation cycle going.</p><p>Boston has a lot going for it and as we see more companies join HubSpot, Wayfair and others in successful exits, it\u2019s only going to build on itself as more money and talent flow into the area. But the success of the last two weeks could be a sign that one of those alternative Silicon Valleys is already here.</p>", "title": ["Wayfair and HubSpot IPOs Could Be Just The Beginning For Boston Startup Scene"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},

Today comes the latest development in that strategy: The company has acquired and will be closing down <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.refresh.io\">Refresh.io</a>, a startup and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id582438442\">iOS app</a> of the same name that surfaces insights about people in your networks right before you meet them.</p><p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but it is a talent and technology acquisition. Refresh.io had raised about $10 million from CRV, Redpoint, Foundation Capital and Haystack. The deal was confirmed to us by LinkedIn directly, as well as in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.refresh.io/post/115300546551/announcement\">blog post penned by\u00a0co-founder Bhavin Shah</a>.</p><p>The main app will be closing down on April 15 and the company will not be taking any new sign-ups. Twelve of the current team of 15 (14 full time and one contractor) are joining LinkedIn in Mountain View to work on incorporating the tech they have developed into various LinkedIn products.</p><p>That main app let you log in using Facebook or LinkedIn, and then provided you with relevant pieces of information about a contact such as your most recent interactions, recent and relevant news mentions and so on so that you could\u00a0develop a more updated profile of someone you may not regularly follow\u00a0all that closely.</p><p>\u201cWe are going to be exploring the different ways we can use the ideas they have into a number of different LinkedIn products,\u201d a spokesperson\u00a0for LinkedIn said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to take their smarts and add them to a number of products and come up with a number of insights to make LinkedIn even more valuable.\u201d</p><p>One of these is likely to be LinkedIn\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/linkedin-contacts/id635424128?mt=8\">Connected</a> app, which has already been incorporating some elements of predictive computing to provide some insights and flag when you\u2019re near people in your network, aimed at those using the app on the go and in work environments.</p><p>What will be interesting to see is if LinkedIn chooses to keep some of the integrations that Refresh had developed pre-acquisition. One of the more recent that its team was touting was a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://refresh.io/salesforce\">link with Salesforce</a>. As part of Salesforce\u2019s App Exchange, those who used both Refresh.io and Salesforce would get profiles of users every time they entered a new email address into their Salesforce database.

One of Obama\u2019s first executive orders was to create a new Chief Technology Officer (CTO), a senior advisor charged with engineering novel ways to solve government issues. The top priority was releasing government data to citizens, just like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/09/how-obamas-open-data-order-could-save-lives-energy-costs-and-make-cool-apps/\">Reagan had done</a> with the weather and satellite data that now fuels modern GPS hardware.

Pickups could generally be scheduled within 24 hours, but the service wasn\u2019t what you would consider truly \u201con-demand.\u201d</p><p>The company is changing that. With the latest update to its app and launch of what it calls \u201cWashio Now,\u201d customers will be able to place an order and have their laundry or dry cleaning picked up within the next 30 minutes (or, at the very latest, within the next hour).</p><p>The new version of the app also drastically simplifies the ordering process. Since users generally don\u2019t have to schedule in advance anymore, the app pre-fills the order screen with a customer\u2019s default address and the next available pickup time. That enables one-click access to the service.</p><p>Washio now also provides the same sort of real-time tracking of a customer\u2019s pickup so they have an ETA of when to expect their driver to arrive.*</p><p>CEO Jordan Metzner says the company spent the last six months updating its routing algorithm to provide speedier pickups and deliveries. The service now dynamically routes drivers based on where they are scheduled to make drop-offs and where pickup orders are being requested in real time.</p><p>\u201cWe always dreamed of making Washio as close to on-demand as possible,\u201d Metzner said in a phone conversation. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned\u2026 is that availability is important to the customer.\u201d</p><p>Only about 30 percent of all orders are scheduled more than a day in advance, Metzner told me. The other 70 percent of orders are placed for same-day pickup. Delivery returns generally happen 24 hours later, depending on when a pickup happens.</p><p>Enabling real-time pickup meant doing some logistical acrobatics, however. Unlike Uber, where drivers have free time in-between giving rides to passengers, Washio routes drivers based on where they had previously been scheduled to make deliveries.

{"date": ["2012-07-10"], "text": "<p>An explosive day of online and traditional campaigning appears to have worked \u2014 at least for the present. The Washington DC city council was set to approve an amendment to its far-reaching taxi legislation that would have set a floor price for private cars. But now councilwoman Mary Cheh, who had <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/09/dc-city-councils-uber-amendment-would-force-sedans-to-charge-5x-taxi-prices-and-kill-uberx/\">proposed the so-called \u201cUber Amendment,\u201d</a> says this morning that she is shelving it.</p><p>However,\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/timcraigpost/status/222697203557347330\">reports</a> are indicating that it could return this fall as a separate bill.</p><p>No, TechCrunch has not turned into a DC politics blog (you should check out the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dcist.com/2012/07/cheh_shelves_uber_amendment_after_b.php\">DCist</a> for all the gritty local details on the story, actually). This is a big issue for Uber and a wide range of other private car startups.</p><p>The amendment would have required any private car company to charge at least five times the minimal price of a taxi.\u00a0This would have specifically prevented Uber\u2019s <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/01/uber-opens-up-platform-to-non-limo-vehicles-with-uber-x-service-will-be-35-less-expensive/\">new discounted private car service, UberX</a>, from legally operating in the city. While Uber\u2019s original fleet is comprised of black sedans and other relatively expensive taxi alternatives, UberX runs on Priuses and other less expensive cars, and competes directly with taxis.</p><p>Cheh\u2019s amendment openly stated that the point was to restrict competition, which led many (including myself) to question the motives.</p><p>DC government, and the DC taxi commission in particular, have been cited for a variety of ethical violations over the years, including concerns about the taxi lobby\u2019s power over local offices. The commission <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/11/uberalles/\">itself went after Uber DC</a> in January, after it launched, over dubious legal claims.</p><p>Cheh, a tenured George Washington law professor, had until recently sided with Uber, saying that it was important that DC support startups like it. But the amendment \u2014 which Uber was only able to see late yesterday \u2014 went the other way. She followed up in an email to her colleagues last night stating that she had worked out an agreement with Uber.</p><p>Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick replied in a letter to the city council saying that there was no such agreement, and that the company has been consistently against pricing floors.</p><p>The amendment appears likely to be removed entirely. For now, the road to DC is looking clearer for UberX (and any of the many other startups going up against it) \u2014 at least until this fall.</p><p>Both emails, below.

Reliable service that\u2019s prompt and\u00a0doesn\u2019t discriminate.</em><br><em>Convenience that makes getting around DC a\u00a0breeze without cash</em><br><em>changing hands. Coverage that doesn\u2019t leave you\u00a0stranded late at</em><br><em>night. Our driver-partners provide this service\u00a0because they take</em><br><em>pride in their work, and because they believe in\u00a0making DC a great</em><br><em>place to live and to get around in. When the Council fixes Uber\u2019s</em><br><em>prices, it stands against these basic benefits going to the average</em><br><em>constituent \u2013 that for some reason only the rich can get them.</em></p><p><em>So in addition to quality, we think that doing right by our DC</em><br><em>customers means\u00a0high quality service\u00a0at the best possible price. We</em><br><em>think that is a noble cause. It is because of this\u00a0that we do not</em><br><em>understand how a price\u00a0floor that sets our minimum price at 5 times</em><br><em>the taxi minimum is\u00a0helpful. Why would you want to make a great</em><br><em>transportation option only accessible to the rich and well-heeled? Why</em><br><em>would you so clearly put a special interest ahead of the interests of</em><br><em>those who elected you? The district\u2019s residents showed their severe</em><br><em>displeasure that their elected officials would consider such an</em><br><em>action. The nation\u2019s eyes are watching to see what DC\u2019s elected</em><br><em>officials stand for.</em></p><p><em>And how about the drivers? Uber has created hundreds of\u00a0driver jobs in</em><br><em>the District. Those hundreds of jobs created since our\u00a0launch last</em><br><em>December are on their way to being thousands of jobs. Jobs that the</em><br><em>District needs, and jobs that require high\u00a0performance where drivers</em><br><em>do far better because of great prices driven by Uber\u2019s logistics</em><br><em>technologies. Why protect one small business owner at the severe</em><br><em>expense of another? Our driver-partners talk about the Uber</em><br><em>opportunity in terms of their own American dreams. If you want to see</em><br><em>for yourself, take an Uber for a spin and ask them. Our regular riders</em><br><em>do all the time, and that\u2019s part of where their passion comes from.</em></p><p><em>What many of you may not realize is that Uber is a tech company\u00a0with</em><br><em>local offices bringing incredibly sophisticated technology to\u00a0bare. In</em><br><em>an era where DC needs tech companies to locate themselves\u00a0and grow in</em><br><em>the city, what kind of message does stifling competition\u00a0send to the</em><br><em>technology community? A technology community armed with 100\u2019s of</em><br><em>millions of twitter and Facebook followers who passionately believe in</em><br><em>consumer choice and are willing to wage a digital battle to be heard.</em></p><p><em>So here\u2019s my ask.

You can follow him on Twitter\u00a0</i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tiedtiger\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>here</i></span></a><i>.</i></p><p>It always sounds a bit New Age, but most socio-marketing thinking about all things digital tends to conclude that everything is going atomic. You might call it tribalism, niches, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail\">the Long Tail</a> or anything like that, but all spring from the same source: given choices the market takes choices. Given the opportunity to branch away from the slopstream of controlled markets, that\u2019s what the market tends to do. By this we generally mean that digital rewards efficiency, like a better taxi service, a better shopping service, a better way to get everything you\u2019ve ever wanted <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/matter/the-shut-in-economy-ec3ec1294816\">delivered to your door</a>.</p><p>But we also tend to equate atomization to rewarding niches and say that going digital represents some fundamental disruption of monocultural user taste. Now you can satisfy your urge to listen to obscure Cuban Jazz because it\u2019s out there somewhere, and by extrapolation so can everyone. This is sort of true but not as true as some would wish. The Cuban Jazz may indeed be out there (on Spotify or Pandora perhaps) but most of it remains unlistened-to. Users may have all the choices, but still tend to favor number 1 over number 11,111. This may be for social reasons (not wanting to be left out) or simple laziness (not wanting to go digging through multiple pages just to find the thing you want) but it\u2019s fact.</p><p>Indeed as the digital realm has evolved it has often led to mono-networks, like the App Store, Netflix, Amazon, Google, Steam or Facebook. In theory the App Store is democratized in favor of many developers. In practice it\u2019s top heavy. Same for Netflix, same for YouTube, same for trending posts on social networks. It\u2019s easier to go with the default search engine that everyone says is good rather than strike out and find out what DuckDuckGo is. (And if anything this seems to be even more the case in Asia where some truly colossal companies pretty much are the Internet for end users).\u00a0The long tail may exist, but it\u2019s not as fat as was hoped.</p><p>But neither Chris Anderson or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Elberse\">Anita Elberse</a> are right. Digital rewards some disaggregation and divergence, but both often simply to form new aggregation and convergence points. The determining factor of the degree of monoculturation seems to be whether the target audience is technically literate or not, and often the assumption that the audience will grow more so over time <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://coding2learn.org/blog/2013/07/29/kids-cant-use-computers/\">is unfounded</a>. Digital divergence is also pretty bad at surfacing new ideas. In every instance of a new platform (such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.periscope.tv\">Periscope</a>, say) it automatically gets put to old uses (selfies, cats, yada yada). The niches that the digital realm surfaces are often driven by a sense of cause, but that cause often pre-exists its digital kick.</p><p>So this is why sometimes the new doesn\u2019t work. And sometimes why it does. This is why sometimes the revamped old doesn\u2019t work. And sometimes why it does. Digital stuff seems to follow the adage that it\u2019s better to tell new stories in an old way or old stories in a new way. But not new in a new way or old in an old. New media is best for retelling old tales while old media is best for telling new tales. Kickstarter for re-vamping old tech obsessions, television for <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>So let\u2019s apply that thinking to VR and smart watches, and ask whether either has a hope in hell of succeeding.\u00a0Consider them as two points at either end of a continuum of screen size, of accessibility, of commitment. One is ambient, all the time, incidental. The other is purposeful, a statement of saying I will now put on this technowizardry\u00a0and go do wondrous things. One is technically fearsome, something that has all the outward appearance of needing to buy into a cult. The other is social, quirky, a talking point for a month but also likely faddish. And between those two points? Mobiles, computers, consoles and televisions. The mainstream \u201cold way\u201d platforms that devotees of either end would like to see disrupted. But will they be? Doubtful.</p><p>VR isn\u2019t some scrappy startup scene like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club\">Homebrew Computer Club</a>. It\u2019s a playground of febrile corporate vision projects of the kind that struggle to express what their\u00a0market, product, purpose or business plan really is. Maybe VR seems awesome in demo, but nobody nowhere knows what it\u2019s supposed to be for. This means VR needs a tribe to sustain it for the 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 years it\u2019ll take to become a thing. And so the question is whether the VR tribe is large enough. And if not, whether those outside the tribe can really be convinced to strap on the goggles.\u00a0There are no direct analogies to answer that question, but plenty of negative pointers. One example is the general shape of the peripherals (fancy joysticks etc) business. If VR follows the peripheral-market model it\u2019ll convert maybe 1 in 10 of existing users on platforms to its cause, that probably equates to a too-small audience. Another example is the user-repellence issue. VR, much like 3DTV and movies, makes a non-zero amount of users feel nauseous when they try it. That\u2019s kind of a turn-off, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/24/virtual-nose-could-reduce-simulator-sickness/\">its solutions are increasingly amusing</a>.</p><p>Smartwatches are a completely different story. With smartwatches the question isn\u2019t about market-size feasibility so much as stuckishness (Grammarians: I apologize unreservedly). Consider that if you buy a smartwatch for the same price that you\u2019d buy a tricked out computer, you really won\u2019t want to upgrade it and thus invalidate your\u00a0expensive purchase. Like, maybe not ever. Thus smartwatches might get stuck with a very slow upgrade cycle, leading to a lack of interest for new shiny apps after only a short while, and a niche that doesn\u2019t care that much to talk about its new devices for long. This doesn\u2019t offer developers that much scope to do much with smartwatches long-term.</p><p>This is why I\u2019m tending to be wary of both VR and smartwatches, and any claim that either represents the future. They may represent either end of a spectrum, but they represent extremes. Much as Google Glass represented an extreme or 3DTV represented an extreme they\u2019ll have their devotees. But I have a hard time seeing either as anything other than a niche business \u2013 and each a niche business with structural issues.\u00a0Rather than this being a year of tiny screens or giant eye-wrapping immersion, maybe this is a year when we\u2019ll look at what we already have and figure out what more they can do. Maybe this is\u00a0a time to\u00a0tell new stories in old ways.</p>", "title": ["The VR-Smartwatch Continuum"], "author": ["Tadhg Kelly"]},

That, unlike other digital stores like Steam, the users are too casual, the competition too severe and the availability of choice too damned high. In this world your main\u00a0option (so they say) is to go free-to-play. You have to build a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.develop-online.net/interview/games-as-a-service-what-does-it-mean-for-indies/0189880\">game-as-a-service</a>, be thinking in terms of endless retention and open loops. You have to play psychological tricks to get players over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://open.salon.com/blog/leslienny/2009/09/22/the_psychology_of_free_the_penny_gap\">the penny gap</a>. And to do that, goes the thinking, involves using\u00a0a variety of by-the-book tropes.</p><p>I\u2019ve never bought into this narrative. I\u2019ve often\u00a0felt that the payment\u00a0problem with premium mobile games isn\u2019t\u00a0an\u00a0inherent law of the universe. Smartphones are perfectly fine game devices just like any other and, even if their players do\u00a0trend casual, that shouldn\u2019t mean they behave intrinsically differently for all time. Casual gamers have happily paid in other platforms like Nintendo\u2019s DS and Wii, as well as on PC for\u00a0companies like Big Fish.\u00a0No the premium problem on mobile has\u00a0always struck me as a perception issue.\u00a0It\u2019s about\u00a0how mobile games\u00a0are marketed.</p><p>The medium, as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message\">Marshall McLuhan famously said</a>, is the message. He argued that the form of a medium itself influences how messages delivered through it are received, and therefore changing what they actually say. Taking a leaf from McLuhan then, I\u00a0submit that <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">the message is the product</span></strong>. The tone, approach and strategy of how marketing is conducted shapes what kinds of product can be allowed by a\u00a0product\u2019s developer. What kind of ad you\u2019ll run determines what kind of game you\u2019ll believe can work, and therefore what kind of game you\u2019ll fund and make.</p><p>One of the maxims of the mobile/social revolution is\u00a0that big and stupid advertising is\u00a0a mortal sin. Such tactics are\u00a0considered inferior because they aren\u2019t\u00a0data-driven. New wave game makers, publishers, API providers and platforms consider themselves smarter than lumbering hulks like EA. <em>\u201cLook at the stupid money that big game publishers splurge\u201d</em>, they say. <em>\u201cLook at how incompetent they are, how old school, how TV generation, how Hollywood.\u201d</em>\u00a0Instead they favor the model of performance marketing, that is to say targeted advertising with measurable results.\u00a0This new wave of game studios (which I previous dubbed the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/13/the-san-francisco-games-revolution-is-over/\">San Francisco Revolution</a> before then declaring it over) are all performance marketing wonks.</p><p>Ever since Google Adsense the technology world has asserted\u00a0that advertising should be measurable rather than not. In the world of products and services a lot of money is poured down deep marketing wells creating ads with\u00a0little effect. How many times have you seen, for example, that Taco Bell ad trying to excite you with a\u00a0new and snazzily named recipe\u00a0of corn tortilla, mincemeat and cheese? Can you remember what it was called? Of course not. Many marketing gurus over the last twenty\u00a0years have made a similar\u00a0point, like Seth Godin and his hilarious talks about how <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/13/the-san-francisco-games-revolution-is-over/\">big companies fuel clutter</a>.</p><p>Arguably Taco Bell is wasting its time making those ads, but we can\u2019t know for sure. They are\u00a0not meaningfully measurable. They\u2019re cloaked in woolly terms about brand value and market presence, stuff that either feels like it\u2019s more valuable than saffron or utter bullshit. Most modern thinking seems to incline toward the latter, and\u00a0we see case after case in book after book showing how markets operate in a more tribal and fragmented manner (less\u00a0\u201c<em>Ford F150 Built Tough</em>\u201d, more \u201c<em>Tesla</em>\u201d) than in the three-channel days of television. Thus\u00a0smarter advertising, targeted campaigns, word of mouth, social value and numerous other lower-cost/higher-intelligence approaches are considered superior.</p><p>This is the tradition which\u00a0frames how San Francisco (the revolution, not the place) game companies think. It\u2019s simply taken as read, a mantra repeated from studio to studio as fact.\u00a0New developers\u00a0portray themselves as smarter-through-metrics, as lean, as sensitive to audiences, as tribal and as able to respond. Go to any conference and you hear folks talk up advertising platforms saying they offer premium installs, better tracking, quality not quantity. They believe that they\u2019re disrupting the old with the new and finding a less Hollywood-stupid way of doing things.</p><p>But no. Though they talk \u201clean\u201d and \u201cmarket fit\u201d such developers\u00a0usually\u00a0clone each other\u2019s games to the hilt and blindly follow each others\u2019 leads. They\u00a0know nothing about fit. Though they claim to follow a story of providing value to players and encouraging some to pay, they actually behave like\u00a0Vegas casinos, squeezing, hustling and pushing players into pinch points.\u00a0Though they claim they don\u2019t make Vegas-sized bets and instead\u00a0talk \u201ctribal\u201d marketing, what they actually do is mass-purchase classified advertising and run it\u00a0blindly to a couple of demographics.</p><p>And they\u2019re trapped.</p><p>At certain points in any platform\u2019s life cycle dumb advertising is just fine.\u00a0New platforms often have green-fields phases where the most important task is simply to grab attention.\u00a0I\u2019ve always maintained, for example, that this was the smartest thing that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/04/zyngapocalypse-now-and-what-comes-next/\">the early\u00a0Zynga</a> (both in viral and paid ads) ever did. The problem came\u00a0afterwards, when the platform had settled down and audiences expected more. That\u2019s when performance-only got\u00a0them into trouble because its\u00a0promises were\u00a0never realized.</p><p>In theory performance marketing in games should be like direct marketing to valued customers.\u00a0For example my wife is a member of a wine club\u00a0that regularly sends her emails about great wines at good prices and with an opportunity to buy. That\u2019s good direct marketing at work because she anticipates it. Her club doesn\u2019t need to bombard her in the hope that she\u2019ll click. But with game companies it\u2019s rarely like that.\u00a0It\u2019s great in theory to assemble usage metrics to fine-tune campaigns and find the right audiences, but in practise it\u2019s little more than spam\u00a0marketing and playing a game of razor-thin conversion increases. Unless you have an audience anticipating your\u00a0communication, all you\u2019re doing is trying to find better ways to drive clicks.</p><p>The problem is that entertainment audiences are not commonly\u00a0in an\u00a0anticipatory state.\u00a0The entertainment industry sells untried experiences to audiences that value surprise and hotness instead. Unlike products and services, that means they often don\u2019t want more of the same.\u00a0Just because a player enjoyed one game does not mean they are a customer for that genre.\u00a0Some are, becoming franchise fans (the \u201ctribes\u201d of gaming), but those customers become keenly aware of product quality.\u00a0Many don\u2019t, and instead look to be delighted over and over. They look for the thing that they haven\u2019t done before, and to be surprised.</p><p>For both customer types data-driven marketing models struggle. They can only\u00a0profile the actions\u00a0that the player already made, correlating her along a number of lines\u00a0based on previous activity. But if you\u2019ve ever gone to the front page of Amazon to see it offer you five types of router because you recently just bought one, you know what the limits of that model feel\u00a0like. It tends toward trying to repeat-sell, to sell you\u00a0the exact same thing again, but you\u00a0don\u2019t care about that any more.</p><p>Game makers often think their marketing is\u00a0the same as my wife\u2019s wine club, but it\u2019s not.\u00a0The only reason it\u00a0\u201cworks\u201d is through brute force. Any advertising gets some people to click even if it\u2019s the most useless thing in the world if its scale is large enough, and that can translate into a business. And because this is the shape of most digital marketing \u2013 and it essentially relies on overload \u2013 this is\u00a0why the Internet tends to be bad at selling premium things. In many venues the only opportunities for marketing are small graphic panels, banners, cross-promotional bars and whatnot delivered at volumes.\u00a0They lens the kind of marketing you can build.</p><p>In performance marketing the pitch has\u00a0to be blunt. Something like \u201cInsane Word Puzzle Fun! Play Now!\u201d is the sum total of what can be said. This is why such campaigns\u00a0often go for the obvious, for the pun or the wink. One example is the \u201cLoot the Booty\u201d campaign for Kabam\u2019s\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kabam.com/games/pirates-tides-of-fortune\"><i>Pirates \u2013 Tides of Fortune</i></a>, featuring images of scantily clad ladies and a claim that the game is banned in 12 countries:</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1103750\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/gziyjyu.jpg?w=300&amp;h=250\" alt=\"gZIyJYu\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\"></p><p>In reality? It\u2019s just a formulaic\u00a0midcore social game hoping that 5% of respondents will buy coins in it and pushing them to pay. Same as all the rest, in other words, because it has to be. Its marketing only allows that kind of product to exist.\u00a0These are low quality ads selling low quality products to users who\u2019ve seen a game just like them before and know what to expect. That makes the business of providing these games even more about margins, which depresses the likelihood of the experience being good. The volume of bought advertising has to be very high because its returns will be low, and the resulting commitment to making a great product will be low.</p><p>It becomes a negative cycle, one we saw before on Facebook. Facebook had an\u00a0intrinsic\u00a0instability in its game marketing for four\u00a0reasons: 1) The supply of novice users who\u2019d never encountered its tropes eventually ran\u00a0down. 2) The competition from many identical and commoditized titles turned the ocean red, leading to an increase in deals and offers. 3) The cost of advertising (aka user acquisition) went\u00a0up up up. 4) This lead previously successful studios to overinvest in trying to make the same game again, exploding headcount and turning previous darling Zynga (and many others) into cautionary tales.</p><p>But to get past it takes a change in DNA because you don\u2019t stop becoming a wonk overnight. San Francisco studios tend to have a\u00a0gap in understanding why performance marketing is limited, and this\u00a0is why so many social/mobile game studios\u00a0are institutionally uncreative. They tend to be populated with product manager MBAs with zero feel for design and \u2013 like hiring an accountant to be CEO of a movie studio \u2013 have overly meat-and-potatoes ideas about what\u2019s important. Many of them have never worked in games prior, don\u2019t\u00a0know the value of art and experience in the game making process, or tend to think that those qualities are subjective (in the \u201cto be ignored\u201d vein). All of which\u00a0lenses what kinds of marketing they\u2019ll support and in turn what products they\u2019ll support. But maybe that\u2019s about to change.</p><p>Mobile is different to Facebook. On iOS there\u2019s more editorial\u00a0in the discovery process which means the platform is able to surface innovative titles and thus arrest stagnation. The technology is vastly more capable than Flash-bound Facebook ever was, so there\u2019s more room for innovation and growth. Combine those two traits and we see that mobile is generally a more rounded and diverse market than social networks could be. It has both its\u00a0<i>Puzzle and Dragon</i>\u00a0and its\u00a0<i>Monument Valley</i>\u00a0titles, its\u00a0<i>Hay Day</i>\u00a0and its\u00a0<i>Minecraft</i>. As a result mobile is on course to become the most revenue-valuable platform of them all, beating even console and PC. It also means it\u2019s big enough for some studios to consider a different approach to marketing.</p><p>Such as, for example,\u00a0<i>Game of War</i>.\u00a0<i>Game of War</i>\u00a0is a formulaic take on a genre of \u201clite strategy\u201d games common in mobile\u00a0(tablet and phone).\u00a0The actual game is so-so, but\u00a0<i>Game of War</i>\u00a0is doing something very interesting in\u00a0its marketing strategy.\u00a0Machine Zone (the studio responsible for the game)\u00a0cast\u00a0Kate Upton as the face of the game and then proceeded to shoot some\u00a0high production value television commercials\u00a0to promote it. The ads showed Ms Upton leading armies, inspiring soldiers to vanquish dragons and other feats of derring-do. Then \u2013 and this is the really interesting bit \u2013 they ran these\u00a0ads in prime time between downs in NFL games with a rumored $40m behind them.</p><p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/uHskC7JRL9M?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></span></p><p>And it\u2019s not alone. Supercell is doing something similar with numerous ads for\u00a0<i>Clash of Clans</i>\u00a0and\u00a0<i>Boom Beach</i>, again in prime time sports.\u00a0One\u00a0<i>Boom Beach</i>\u00a0advert shows three fresh soldiers encountering an identical three who\u2019ve been smoked by flamethrowers in a comedic scene. As with the Game of War ads they are high in production value,\u00a0looking like trailers for decent\u00a0animated movies. I find both intriguing and wonder who else is going to do the same. Blizzard, for example, just produced a beautiful trailer for its upcoming\u00a0<i>Gnomes vs Goblins</i>\u00a0expansion for\u00a0<i>Hearthstone</i>. Although availble on multiple platforms,\u00a0<i>Hearthstone</i>\u00a0is primarily\u00a0thought of as a mobile game. Will it soon feature in an ad campaign on TV too, much as Blizzard already does with\u00a0<i>World of Warcraft?</i></p><p>It leads me to wonder who else could be using these tactics as opposed to hoping that Apple will feature them as a ticket for success. What if, for example, someone had paid to advertise\u00a0<i>Monument Valley</i>\u00a0on TV? Might it have sold 50m copies instead of 5m?</p><p>Say what you like about the inefficiencies of a console publisher like\u00a0Sony, EA or Activision, but the one thing they know how to do is sell an experience. They essentially treat a big game much like Marvel treats\u00a0<i>Age of Ultron</i>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmeOjFno6Do\">You\u2019ve seen that trailer, right</a>? Of course you have. Everyone has because it was a thing that had to be seen. But why? Because of the promise of experience.\u00a0It was through that trailer, through the direct watching of it and the supporting social buzz that emerged around it, that we all became excited. It was through a \u201cblockbuster\u201d style of marketing that it told you a story, appealing directly to your right brain and not having to tell you to \u201cWatch Now!\u201d or boast that it\u2019s banned in Ghana.</p><p>That\u00a0<i>Age of Ultron</i>\u00a0trailer was expensive, but will prove its worth in the long run. You\u2019ll pay to see it, to eat popcorn while seeing it and \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t suck \u2013 probably pay to own a digital version later too.\u00a0The medium is the message and the message is the product, remember. In Marvel\u2019s case the medium of cinema sends the message of the big experience, and the message disseminated through a high value trailer leads to the will to make a high value product: a big splashy movie. That\u2019s how it earned the right to be thought of as premium. That\u2019s how games do that too.</p><p>Trailers\u00a0don\u2019t have to cost ten million dollars or feature during the Super Bowl to work. You can be innovative with them and gain buzz another way. However the net effect is the same:\u00a0High quality experience marketing directly leads to that sense of premium entertainment product, which in turn is why people pay a premium for it. It\u2019s why Netflix dumped a fortune into making\u00a0<i>House of Cards</i>, why game publishers assemble for E3 and run \u00a0super-quality infomercials. It\u2019s why, semi-relatedly, folks will\u00a0pay $700 for an iPhone but expect Android phones to be free.</p><p>Now tell me: if I restricted\u00a0you to a format of postage-stamp sized ads and a mandate that each ad had to generate\u00a0clicks, how likely do you think you\u2019d be able to use them to create\u00a0<i>Age of\u00a0Ultron</i>\u00a0excitement for a game? Not at all. And knowing that, how likely do you think such a product would be to get funded at your studio? Not at all. The message is the product.\u00a0And since the message\u00a0for mobile games is D-grade, so are the games.</p><p>In many respects the way that marketing (and therefore products) have been handled in mobile games has tended to boil down to strip-mall tactics. It\u2019s penny rich, pound poor, but it doesn\u2019t have to stay that way. Indeed I would argue that it\u2019s unlikely to.\u00a0The problem with all performance marketing is essentially that it comes with a skinflint attitude, and as such is self-limiting. Whereas blockbuster marketing comes from with an abundance attitude. It asks how much can be spent to inspire, and in so doing what kind of product can be inspiring?</p><p>That\u2019s why it works on console despite the colossal sums involved. Consoles don\u2019t have anywhere near the install base that mobile does and yet console game publishers repeatedly sell millions of copies of key games. Indeed they manage to somehow sell to 20, 30, 40 or even 50% of the entire install base in some cases, which is a ludicrous number in the mobile world. That\u2019s because they know how to sell premium.</p><p>When\u00a0mobile game companies lose their arrogance about Hollywood tactics and realize that there\u2019s so much more they can do, I think it will change the mobile game market for the better. The casinos in Las Vegas eventually realized that there was much more value in building a big experience than penny pinching existing crowds, and in the process turned the town from a seedy den of thieves to an adult Disneyland. They thought in terms of experience rather than performance, and lo and behold made far more money in the process.</p><p>If we could take that attitude and run with it I think we\u2019d stop being so amazed at the idea that a mobile game could charge up front.\u00a0Just as movies and other games do, the act of selling actively increases the perception of value and therefore price. The message changes, and so does the product. This virtuous cycle then starts to pay dividends.\u00a0Apple, for example, is more likely to feature you if you appear to be worth featuring, and a major way to do that is to demonstrate intent.\u00a0It costs a lot, but with the right kind of game it translates into mega revenue, so it\u2019s worth doing.</p><p>Dean Takahashi reckons that we\u2019ll soon see a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2014/12/26/the-deanbeat-the-2b-mobile-game-and-other-bold-predictions-for-2015/\">$2bn mobile game</a>, and maybe he\u2019s right. But in the longer term I think we\u2019ll see a premium-marketed and premium-priced mobile revolution, more LA and less SF, selling to everyone. Who knows how big that\u00a0will\u00a0get.</p>", "title": ["The Message Is The Product: Solving Mobile Gaming\u2019s Price Problem"], "author": ["Tadhg Kelly"]},

There are no [traditional] clusters, just server pods that are all connected to each other.\u201d</p><p>This led to the final requirement: how to deal with modular switches that weren\u2019t situated at the top of the rack, but within the fabric itself. Today\u2019s announcement solves that final problem by introducing a monster fully open modular switch based on Wedge, that like the top of rack switch, has separated the hardware and software from the network, and given Facebook total flexibility on how to program and run it.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1118044\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/6pack_open.jpg?w=680&amp;h=453\" alt=\"Facebook 6pack data switches.\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\"></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/717010588413497/introducing-6-pack-the-first-open-hardware-modular-switch/\">Facebook describes it</a> as follows:</p><p>You may wonder why Facebook went to all this trouble, but it believed it needed to build the entire network from scratch because in its view, commercial offerings were just too limiting for the speed and scale a company like Facebook must have.</p><p>\u201cOne of the things we saw in the network industry was that it wasn\u2019t open enough,\u201d Matt Corddry, director of hardware engineering at Facebook explained. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to expand and grow our technology with commercial networking equipment.

On one side are the customers who hire consultants to build them a cloud. On the other side are the IBM customers who will always be IBM customers.</p><p>And in the middle are two classes of customers who have one thing in common, McKenty said. \u00a0They have a data problem and with that comes deeper interest in the infrastructure, be it their own or a third-party that manages it for them.</p><p>In one camp of this middle market are the customers who want a more enterprise-grade agreement, McKenty said. They want reliability and durability in the virtual machines they run. In the other camp are the companies with SaaS or cloud apps that are seeking more than what AWS offers.</p><p>Realistically, AWS is in fine shape and will continue to dominate. They were the first to step ahead and provide services that abstract the complexity of managing data. Their place in the market is solid and will remain that way for some time to come.</p><p>More important? As data becomes a growing problem, so will the interest in open cloud technologies. \u00a0For example, Cisco projects a 66% compound annual growth rate in mobile traffic between 2012 and 2017.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/02/how-customers-think-about-data-changes-the-clouds-market-pie/ciscomobiledtatraffic/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-826254\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-826254\" alt=\"ciscomobiledtatraffic\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ciscomobiledtatraffic.jpg?w=349&amp;h=343\" width=\"349\" height=\"343\"></a></p><p>Customers that grow wildly will see a better value in moving off AWS. Others will want better service level agreeements and more control over their data. \u00a0Those companies will move off AWS, too.</p><p>The DevOps movement will continue to help companies like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.puppetlabs.com\">Puppet Labs</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.opscode.com/\">Opscode</a> prosper as more companies look to process more data and get better productivity while keeping heasd counts low. It\u2019s just a complete change that will shift the trillion dollar IT budget toward the open cloud.</p><p>IBM, AT&amp;T, HP, Red Hat \u2014 all of these companies are investing in the open cloud to help companies deal with the new realities of the data world. Customers have to consider that to grow they will need to analyze data to be more predictive and more so, just develop better ways get their work done. Managing terabytes of data will be the norm. \u00a0Customers will have to think about how data moves around and syncs to different devices, be it a smartphone or a tablet. It will mean adopting open-source analytics technologiies such as Hadoop and considering how to extend the infrasrtructure at minimal cost.</p><p>As a result, open cloud movements are emerging that will help create this dream of the \u201cfederated cloud,\u201d that my colleague <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://rishidot.com\">Krishnan Subramanian</a> has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cloudave.com/15323/defining-federated-cloud-ecosystems/\">written about</a>:</p><p>It\u2019s just a matter of cost in many respects. A small provider in India will want to connect into an open cloud service. Why not? It will give their customers a more effective way to compete with the data that they have and can access.</p><p>Just looke at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://opencompute.org\">Open Compute\u00a0Project</a>\u00a0. Facebook started it when they were looking at building out its data center in Prineville, Or. The hardware they wanted had to be invented themselves. So they helped get Open Compute up established. Developers and engineers have been showing up in droves, hacking new ways to create servers and now network switches that are cheap and can run on processors that you\u2019d find on a smartphone.</p><p>There\u2019s also the Apache Foundation\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cloudstack.apache.org/\">Cloudstack</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://opennebula.org/\">Open Nebula</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.eucalyptus.com/participate\">other communities</a> which are all fostering community development. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.qyjohn.net/?p=3120\">Data analysis by Eucalyptus Director of Customer Service Qingye Jiang</a> shows how the open cloud movement is growing as the market adapts to a data intensive world.</p><p>The open cloud market is far larger than any of these groups. And it\u2019s the shift in thinking about data that will increase its size. These open organizations will play a vital role as they represent affordable and production-ready systems for building up clouds.</p><p>The discussion about open cloud ecosystems reminds me of a conversation I had earlier in the week with<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.brinqa.com/\"> Brinqa</a> CEO\u00a0Amad Fida. Brinqa uses a NoSQL graph database to do risk analysis for customers. Fida said Splunk indexes machine data for search. Brinqa offers context to machine data so customers can build models that help them make decisions that don\u2019t rely on guessing.</p><p>I asked Fida how data is changing customers\u2019 perspectives about their businesses. He said it\u2019s evident that data is causing customers to think more about the infrastructure they run. They are doing more analysis to determine where they keep their data and the data center operations required to process it.</p><p>As customers use more data, they will seek ways to make the process more efficient, which in turn will further force a cultural change that marries developers and operations, McKenty said. \u00a0That\u2019s Pistion\u2019s big push as evident in its latest 2.0 release.</p><p>Apps will scale out, the storage needs will magnify and networking will become more defined by software that is virtualized\u00a0and optimized to run across not just data centers but endless sensor networks embedded into our homes and everything we know of.</p><p>A proprietary cloud stack like AWS can only have so much appeal in such a scale-out world. McKenty argues that they are seeing customers like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.itworld.com/cloud-computing/352750/more-talk-customers-leaving-aws-shift-points-experience-not-trouble-amazon\">Hubspot move off AWS </a>to create their own virtual infrastructure. These are companies that want more fine-grained control than they can get with AWS. They want better support contracts, as AWS is primarily a self-service vendor. If they think they need SSDs they want to add what they think is best <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/07/new-high-io-ec2-instance-type-hi14xlarge.html\">instead of leaving it to AWS to deploy</a>.</p><p>Data is changing the world. That\u2019s what is fueling the open cloud movement and will guarantee its success. We are starting to push and pull data from everything we know of. And now we are learning how to process it and turn it into digital goods. How we do that is one of the biggest questions of all.</p>", "title": ["Why The Data Problem Is A Good Thing For The Open Cloud Movement"], "author": ["Alex Williams"]},

But now Facebook is bringing auto-play for native videos to all users after <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/12/facebook-tests-silent-auto-play-for-user-videos-in-mobile-feed-foreshadowing-video-ads/\">testing</a> the feature in September. And it\u2019s just the beginning of a huge push to put Facebook in motion.</p><p>Previously, any video uploaded to Facebook directly or shared to the News Feed from Instagram would appear the same as YouTube videos \u2014 locked behind a play button. While the conscious decision to stop scrolling for, open the video player, wait for it to load, and watch might not seem like a big deal, it may have been too much of a time and effort investment for some. If people don\u2019t watch videos, they don\u2019t get likes and comments that encourage friends to upload more, and they might skip uploading them themselves.</p><p>But after spotting an auto-play video in my feed yesterday and asking Facebook, the company confirms\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/News/715/An-Easier-Way-to-Watch-Video\">the new format</a> is now internationally rolled out to most iOS and Android users and will reach all of them soon. Facebook tells me it\u2019s still testing this feature on desktop and doesn\u2019t have schedule for when it will roll out there.</p><p>On mobile, auto-play gives natively uploaded Facebook videos and ones shared from Instagram an advantage: you don\u2019t have to think about playing them, they play themselves. At first they\u2019ll play in-line even as you scroll, but with no sound. If you tap them, they expand full-screen and the audio kicks in. Videos uploaded to third-party sites retain the old click-to-play-format.</p><p>I\u2019ve found the new design to be quite pleasing. As I wrote when Facebook\u2019s auto-play style was first unveiled, it feels a bit like the moving photos in the Harry Potter newspapers.</p><p>If you d<img class=\"alignright\" alt=\"Prisoner_of_Azkaban_-_Sirius_Black\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/prisoner_of_azkaban_-_sirius_black.gif?w=300&amp;h=127\" width=\"300\" height=\"127\">on\u2019t want to watch, you can scroll by with little disruption. This isn\u2019t Myspace, Vine, or Instagram where auto-play sound is suddenly going to bombard everyone around you. If you\u2019re not sure if you want to watch, you get a little preview. Maybe the thumbnail was dull but motion shows the video is actually exciting. A little animated audio levels icon clues you in to there being sound to be heard, though. You can watch silently if you don\u2019t have headphones or privacy, but if you want the full experience, you can tap and the video plays instantly without a loading delay.</p><p>To respect users who don\u2019t want to burn data, Facebook has added a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/403914676403278#I-only-want-videos-to-play-automatically-over-WiFi.-Where-can-I-adjust-this-setting?\">setting\u00a0</a>that lets you only auto-play videos if you\u2019re on WiFi and not on cellular data.

We\u2019re doing this to make sure we create the best possible experience. Over time, we\u2019ll continue to explore how to bring this to marketers in the future.\u201d I would bet we\u2019re going to hear some news about this soon, either just before or after the New Year.</p><p>Facebook recently starting letting developers put <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/21/facebook-app-ads-video-cpa/\">videos in their app install ads</a>, but those don\u2019t auto-play. Maybe they will eventually, though.</p><p>For advertisers, auto-play videos could make their ads a lot more noticeable. Most people wouldn\u2019t volunteer to watch a video ad (cool movie trailers aside), but if it\u2019s already playing and looks compelling, they might watch or even expand it to include sound too. Facebook is a fan of consistency, so video ads might have a very similar user experience to organic videos.</p><p>Because they\u2019re more captivating, Facebook could potentially charge a lot to show video ads. Back in September, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/facebook-pushes-back-back-october-launch-video-ads/244009/\">AdAge reported</a> Facebook could charge between\u00a0$1 million and $2.4 million to distribute a 15-second video ad for a day. Facebook raked in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/30/facebooks-q3-13-beats-with-2-02b-revenue-0-25-eps-with-49-of-ad-revenue-now-mobile/\">$2.02 billion in Q3 2013</a>, and video ads could give that number a significant bump in Q1 and Q2 2014. Finally, we might start to see a landslide of ad spend previously devoted to television coming online, as the Facebook format would be relatively familiar (though possibly with no sound unless clicked).</p><p><img alt=\"Consumer Video Test Screenshot TechCrunch\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/consumer-video-test-screenshot-techcrunch.jpg?w=640&amp;h=586\" width=\"640\" height=\"586\"></p><p>The question remains whether users will freak out about video ads. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/12/facebook-tests-silent-auto-play-for-user-videos-in-mobile-feed-foreshadowing-video-ads/#comments\">Comments</a> on my last piece about them and general sentiment has been quite wary of what video ads will do to the Facebook experience. If they\u2019re the most eye-catching things on the social network, they could seem quite annoying. AdAge says Facebook might cap video ads so users don\u2019t see more than three a day. Striking the right balance will be critical, though surprisingly, Facebook found that showing static photo ads in the News Feed<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/30/facebook-users-dont-hate-news-feed-ads/\"> hasn\u2019t had a significant negative impact on engagement</a>.</p><p>And if you\u2019re thinking to yourself, \u201cAdBlock Plus, bro\u201d, that\u2019s up to you. Personally, I think ads are the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/23/okcupid-ad-blocker/\">lifeblood of innovation</a>, funding free products we rely on. But they\u2019re a nuisance unless well-targeted, so hopefully Facebook can keep video ads relevant to the viewer. Otherwise I\u2019d expect a lot of people to look for ways to banish them from their feed.</p><p>The secret to making people swallow video ads might be getting them to shoot mini-movies themselves. If there were more user generated videos on the site, the ads would blend in.</p><p>The problem is, right now Facebook\u2019s video creation tool is painfully outdated. Unlike its Instagram Video product, there\u2019s no way to shoot multiple shots in a single video, no editing, no stabilization, no cover image, and no filters. That means videos shot with Facebook often look pretty crummy. Crummy videos get few likes, so people don\u2019t shoot them, so no one sees them, so no one thinks to shoot them\u2026</p><p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-924623\" alt=\"facebook-sign-89\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/facebook-sign-89.jpg?w=371&amp;h=208\" width=\"371\" height=\"208\">It\u2019s time for Facebook to modernize its video creation tool.</p><p>It could easily port in the Instagram Video features, maybe with a better tagging interface since Facebook is more about friends. It also has <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/07/instagram-is-listening/\">patents on some pretty futuristic video technologies</a> like recording video as soon as your camera is open, recognizing and tagging faces or locations, and detecting audio and visual cues like saying \u201cthat\u2019s beautiful\u201d to select a cover image thumbnail or create anchors for navigating around within a video while watching.</p><p>These features could make it much more fun to shoot and view Facebook videos, which could fill the feed with them and camouflage the video ads.</p><p>And even if the native creation tools stay the same, a better watching interface could make a big difference. Right now there\u2019s no real way to discover and watch Facebook videos in bulk. A Facebook \u201cchannel\u201d that showed your friends\u2019 videos back-to-back (perhaps with clips from Pages and advertisers mixed in) could be an addictive lean-back experience. Better video viewing could pit Facebook in more direct competition with YouTube.</p><p>So basically, Facebook has a huge opportunity to step up its video\u2026game, and auto-play on mobile is just the first step. Photos fueled Facebook\u2019s popularity back in its early days. As it turns 10 years old in 2014, we\u2019ll see if video can give it a second wind.</p><p><em>[Image Credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bgr.com/2013/06/20/facebook-event-live-streaming-instagram-video/\">BGR</a>]</em></p>", "title": ["Facebook Videos Now Auto-Play On Mobile, Expect Video Ads Soon"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},

The difference is that, on the enterprise version, developers can customize Corona\u2019s engine to their own needs. \u201cInstead of writing in pure scripts, you can add your own code \u2013 your Objective C code, your Java code \u2013 and do whatever you want with it,\u201d explains Luh. He says that demand for the product has ranged from indie developers to larger studios and everyone in between. But until now, developers had to reach out to Corona directly to gain access to the Enterprise option. That will change with the new funding. \u201cWe want to make that much more automated in the same way you do the SDK,\u201d Luh says. And that requires more engineers.</p><p>Specifically, Corona hopes to use the funding to double its headcount from the 11 it has today to include more core, back-end and framework engineers.\u00a0In addition, the company is planning on rolling out additional, in-demand features and third-party integrations to its Corona SDK product, the first of which should arrive within the next month. As to what these features will be, Luh is staying mum, only saying that these are things that its developers have been asking for but that Corona didn\u2019t have the sheer manpower to deliver until now.</p><p>To date, Corona has been used by more than 150,000 developers worldwide. And it has seen more than 20,000 games, apps and e-books built using its platform and published to iOS, Android, Nook, and Kindle Fire devices.

When we look at educational technology products, it\u2019s a lot more difficult to make sure that whatever that intervention or product is\u00a0looks identical across all those different classrooms,\u201d says Chesal.</p><p>In 2014 the Gates Foundation backed InnovateNYC\u00a0so it could\u00a0work with Johns Hopkins University to figure out a better way to measure the\u00a0efficacy of new technology in the classroom. \u00a0One of the\u00a0companies that InnovateNYC\u00a0is working with, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kinvolved\">Kinvolved</a>, is an attendance improvement solution that targets students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are chronically absent from school.</p><p>\u201cTo close the achievement gap we have to look for support from multiple perspectives and lenses, so changing pedagogy, changing the leadership, making sure students are independent,\u201d says Chesal. \u201cTechnology is one lever in that, it\u2019s not necessarily a silver bullet, but it can be an enabler.\u201d</p><p>Chesal hopes that Innovate NYC will provide teachers with a way to\u00a0track down\u00a0and compare\u00a0the latest\u00a0classroom tech products instead of relying on word of mouth. It\u2019s\u00a0especially valuable in school districts like New York City, where principals\u00a0maintain control of\u00a0each school\u2019s\u00a0budget.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s the whole question of city-wide or district-wide adoption of things \u2014 it\u2019s the same as selling in the enterprise and trying to get full adoption,\u201d says Kapor. \u201cThat\u2019s where the challenge is gonna be for edtech, and that\u2019s going to require some system change.\u201d</p><p>Changing the system won\u2019t happen at the blazing startup speed Silicon Valley is used to, but it\u2019s off to a good start.</p><p>\u201cThere are all kinds of obstacles, whether it\u2019s politics or money or whatever, but I am very optimistic,\u201d says Quazzo.\u00a0\u201cAnd by the way, the solution is not simply technology either, it\u2019s a million things, it\u2019s the Jim Collins\u2019 20 million mile march.

It\u2019s not for everybody, but early adopters who appreciate getting the chance at a sneak peak of tweaks before they come to market will appreciate the opportunity.</p><p>The program comes with its own special utility software for installation on your Mac, which makes pre-release versions of OS X visible in your Mac App Store\u2019s Updates tab.

People come out with their heads a little melty but they can write production code that Monday.\u201d Big Nerd Ranch is the same squad that\u2019s taught iOS development at Apple and Android development at Google. Facebook has trained 450 mobile engineers with the program since July.</p><p>Staffers turned mobile marines recently uncovered a huge stumbling block in Android Gingerbread, which runs on about half of all phones running Android, which on about half the phones in the world. Android\u2019s virtual machine Dalvik, which actually runs the apps you install, had a 3 million method limit. Facebook had already hit that limit, meaning it couldn\u2019t build any more features into its native Android app.</p><p>Shaver laid out Facebook\u2019s three options: Stop developing its Android app, stop offering its Android app for Gingerbread users, or fix Dalvik. Luckily, \u201cwe could look under the hood and see why we were hitting this limit. Not common to be able to do this in the mobile operating system,\u201d Shaver says, complementing Android\u2019s openness.</p><p>So a bunch of Facebook mobile engineers spent a few weeks analyzing the problem and came up with a patch that was only about six lines of code. Shaver happily admits, \u201cWe were able to send the patch over to Google to get their opinion. They were very helpful.\u201d Google looked at the patch for a day and gave Facebook the go-ahead.

So the balancing act then is to\u00a0correctly allocate resources for cluster-to-cluster communication and intra-cluster networking.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1083473\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/facebook-data-center-news-frederictechcrunch-com-techcrunch-mail-1.png?w=851&amp;h=654\" alt=\"Facebook data center news - frederic@techcrunch.com - Techcrunch Mail-1\" width=\"851\" height=\"654\"></p><p>With Facebook\u2019s new approach, however, the entire data center runs on a single high-performance network. There are no clusters, just server pods that are all connected to each other. Each pod has 48 server racks \u2014 that\u2019s much smaller than Facebook\u2019s old clusters \u2014 and all of those pods are then connected to the larger network. You can find all the sordid details about how exactly Facebook architected this setup <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://code.facebook.com/posts/360346274145943/introducing-data-center-fabric-the-next-generation-facebook-data-center-network/\">here</a> (and you can read all about the BGP4 routing protocol, TOR uplinks, as well as RIB and FIB resources there, too).</p><p>What matters, though, is that this is a very modular approach that\u00a0has already allowed Facebook to increase its intra-building network capacity ten-fold compared to the old design and the company believes that a 50x improvement is possible.</p><p>And with all of that, your friends will get even faster alerts when you like their babies\u2019 pictures on Facebook.</p>", "title": ["Facebook\u2019s Newest Data Center Is Now Online In Altoona, Iowa"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},
{"date": ["2014-06-18"], "text": "<p>Today <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a> announced new modularized top-of-rack networking switch technology and a new Linux OS to control these switches. The company\u00a0will eventually share this technology as part of its Open Compute Project.</p><p>Jay Parikh, Facebook\u2019s VP of Infrastructure Engineering, made the announcement at GigaOm\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://events.gigaom.com/structure-2014/\">Structure Conference</a> in an interview with Derrick Harris.</p><p>Parikh says there has been an effort under way for a number of years to disaggregate (or break down into smaller components) the main parts of the Facebook data center. So far, it\u2019s\u00a0been able to do this with compute, server and storage, but up to this point, the company has\u00a0been using traditional top-of-rack switches.</p><p>Today that changed when Parikh announced a new top-of-rack switch called Wedge. The idea he said was to break the hardware and software into component parts or modules making it easy to change any part of the system to give the company\u00a0ultimate flexibility to make changes as its needs change over time.</p><p>From a configuration standpoint, Wedge is a 40GB switch with 16 slots, expandable to 32, and fits in a standard rack. But IT pros can swap out components or change the way they configure each piece to meet a variety of needs.</p><p>Parikh says that what makes Wedge different is the way it\u2019s architected makes it operate more like a server.\u00a0He says this will allow software developers and hardware engineers much greater flexibility in how they design and call the various components inside the box. FBoss is the new Linux-based OS\u00a0that will operate Wedge.</p><p>\u201cOne lingering block has been the network, which has been connected in a conventional manner: Buy this box, put it in the top, plug it in, configure it and go,\u201d Parikh explained.</p><p>But Parikh said using that appliance approach was really slowing them down and they have been looking for a solution that provided them more control.</p><p>Matt Corddry, director of hardware engineering at Facebook, said that by breaking this down\u00a0into component parts\u00a0gives their software developers\u00a0much greater flexibility to manipulate the different pieces of hardware programmatically in ways that just weren\u2019t possible in the old fixed-appliance kind of approach where the hardware was just a black box.</p><p>What\u2019s more, hardware engineers can swap pieces in and out of the chassis to meet their needs.</p><p>Corddry says for a company like Facebook, which\u00a0has such a wide variety of needs from its network \u2014 whether it\u2019s the main Facebook app, moving pictures with Instagram or chat with Facebook Messenger (and whatever comes down the road later) \u2014 this approach just gives them tremendous flexibility to configure the different pieces in the network, including the top-of-rack switch to meet their changing requirements.</p><p>Corddry told me that the company doesn\u2019t yet have a date set to release this new switch to open source, but it will continue to work on it and today\u2019s announcement was the beginning of a larger conversation with the community at large.</p><p>As Prikh said, Facebook will welcome the input when it comes. He believes if the community can make it better, cheaper or faster, then they will use that design. The company isn\u2019t\u00a0wedded specifically to its design, but at the same time, it needs to run its business, solve its internal problems and continue to build flexibility into its own data center even as it shares with the Open Compute Project.</p>", "title": ["Facebook\u2019s New Open-Source Data Switch Technology Is Designed For Flexibility And Greater Control"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},

SpaceX is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spacex.com/press/2015/02/11/dscovr-launch-update\">still aiming to launch DSCOVR</a>, an observatory satellite, later today, but the \u00a0first-stage rocket recovery attempt that was planned along with that mission has been sadly scrubbed, owing to nature\u2019s wrath.</p><p>In a brief update, SpaceX said that while it still plans to launch DSCOVR during a launch window that kicks off at 6:03 PM ET today (after scrapping two previous attempts Sunday and Tuesday), its planned recovery attempt for the reusable first stage of Falcon 9\u2019s rocket won\u2019t be part of the mission. SpaceX has retrofitted a huge seafaring vessel with autonomous smarts that let it hold its position in the ocean to within 3 meters, providing a stable landing pad for the stage 1 rocket, but the drone ship can\u2019t handle the three-story swells currently afflicting the Atlantic Ocean. The drone ship is working on only three of four engines due to a malfunction, making any attempt to thread the needle on those huge waves inconceivable.</p><p>SpaceX\u2019s launch today is still exciting, but the Falcon 9 rocket recovery was a more important part of the mission for Elon Musk\u2019s spacefaring startup. A previous attempt resulted in a dramatic explosion thanks to a shortage of hydraulic fluid, but that was the closest the company has yet come to getting its rocket back to ground safely. Proving the viability of its reusable rocket recovery system is extremely important to SpaceX\u2019s long-term vision of more affordable, efficient spaceflight. SpaceX says that while they\u2019ll try to do a soft landing in water with today\u2019s launch, survival isn\u2019t expected based on the extreme sea conditions. They should still garner useful landing data from the attempt, however.</p><p>Musk is probably already hard at work solving for brownstone-sized waves\u00a0with the drone landing pad design, so hopefully this won\u2019t happen again.</p>", "title": ["SpaceX\u2019s Rocket Recovery Attempt Thwarted By Humanity\u2019s Oldest Enemy: The Sea"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},

Sure, it cites some big numbers in terms of current users, claiming 100,000 Dropbox for Business users including high profile clients like MIT and Hard Rock Cafe. Yet\u00a0it\u2019s also feeling heat from competitors like Box and Egnyte who aimed at the enterprise early. Dropbox came to the game much later and has been building a business tool incrementally that\u2019s increasingly appealing to large enterprise customers.</p><p>What\u2019s more, it lost the guy who helped build the business tool Ilya Fushman a couple of weeks ago <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/index-ventures-hires-dropbox-exec-ilya-fushman-as-general-partner/\">when he left to join Index Ventures.</a>\u00a0Regardless, the show must\u00a0go on and work has continued as\u00a0the torch was passed to Rob Baesman, head of product for Dropbox for Business, who had been Fushman\u2019s chief lieutenant for about a year.</p><p>Today, the company announced several new features.</p><p>To answer some of those security concerns from larger organizations, Dropbox is\u00a0providing a way to force users to add\u00a0two-factor identification to access their files. If a user has failed to do this, they will be guided through the process of signing up automatically.</p><p>It\u00a0also built a tool that\u00a0creates three levels of administration. It\u2019s been designed to line up with standard ways large companies tend to organize administrative activities, Baesman said.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1167319 size-medium\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screenshot-tiered-admin-roles.png?w=300&amp;h=244\" alt=\"Dropbox for Business administrative tiers dialog box.\" width=\"300\" height=\"244\"></p><p>The company also has made it easier to maintain sharing relationships with\u00a0existing folders, something that was apparently a pain point for customers prior to offering this feature. This was particularly important for migration, data loss prevention (DLP) and digital rights management (DRM) vendors who plug into Dropbox for Business.</p><p>The Shared Folder API makes it simpler to interact directly with the folder in an automated fashion. In the case of DLP, this means if a person is violating a particular policy, such as sharing Social Security numbers, the API makes it easier to turn off sharing associated with the questionable file. A third-party tool can access the folder and\u00a0make sure the file\u00a0doesn\u2019t move any further and cause a problem.</p><p>Finally, it has released a connector for Active Directory, which should also help ease deployment in large organizations. Customers had been accessing Active Directory through an\u00a0API, but this provides a way to link more directly to the popular directory service.</p><p>None of these alone is an earth-shattering new feature, but it is part of an overall evolution for Dropbox for Business as it works to make it easier to use\u00a0inside large settings. Dropbox still has its work cut out for it, but with each passing iteration, it is making the tool more appealing to business by\u00a0providing the types of tools and APIs that large organizations are going to expect.</p>", "title": ["Dropbox Adds More Features To Attract Enterprise Customers"], "author": ["Ron Miller"]},

Flickr offers 1 terabyte free, but you and your viewers have to endure frequent full-page ads from its parent company Yahoo. Amazon offers free unlimited storage, but you have to buy a $99 a year Prime subscription.</p><p>But Google is willing to throw its money around. It earns enough on search ads that it can completely subsidize photo storage as a long-term investment. Google knows that photos are a gold mine. They contain an immense amount of information about the people who took them that could be used to target ads and personalize experiences\u2026if you have the tools to mine them.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1164189\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/google-io-20150192.jpg?w=680&amp;h=453\" alt=\"google-io-20150192\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\">Google does. Its advanced computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other technologies will let it determine what people, places, and things are in photos, and tie that data to your identity. Pics of you with your favorite soda or a motorcycle could tell it what to show you in ads. Locations ID\u2019d by landmarks could help it predict what you\u2019re searching for. And selfies with friends could clue Google in to who it should recommend you share something with.</p><p>The app even does the hard work of editing and curating photos. Its \u201cAssistant\u201d feature can balance out overexposure, turn burst shots into GIFs, and make little movies from your adventures. While pure file storage may have become a commodity anyone can offer, Google Photos does a lot that only the search giant could pull off.</p><p>According to interviews with Google VP Bradley Horowitz by\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medium.com/backchannel/bradley-horowitz-says-that-google-photos-is-gmail-for-your-images-and-that-google-plus-is-not-dead-54be1d641526\">Backchannel\u2019s Steven Levy</a>, the computer vision isn\u2019t perfect yet, but that\u2019s kind of the point of this launch. \u201cThe key to getting that last percentage which tips it over will come now, when we deploy it at scale.

And since you won\u2019t want to move your massive archive of memories, Google Photos could bind you tighter to its family of apps and services.\u00a0Some might worry about giving Google so much information, but we\u2019ve already let it host our email, and that hasn\u2019t turned out so badly.</p><p>Google is often criticized for not \u201cgetting\u201d humans. But Photos ties together some its most powerful technologies so it doesn\u2019t have to. Storage, editing, organization and search all happen automatically. There\u2019s no need for manually moving files, correcting colors, tagging subjects, or rifling through reams of pictures.</p><p>That\u2019s what makes Google Photos perfect for the casual photographer.

Vimeo still has a large community of contributors and viewers who are into its sort of high-value, high-quality video content.</p><p>And so, Vimeo has been trying to find ways to monetize that content. It began that quest way back in 2009 with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/blog/post:172\">Vimeo Plus</a>, which created a freemium business model for hardcore users of the site.

For example, if the device\u2019s GPS detects you\u2019re moving at more than 10 MPH, then Caret can show a trusted contact that you\u2019re currently in a vehicle and may not be able to respond immediately to an incoming call or text. In another example, if you turn your phone face down while in a meeting, Caret will inform your colleagues that you\u2019re not available.</p><p>The app can also tap into your calendar to display free/busy information to business colleagues, or even event details to a highly trusted contact, like your spouse.</p><p>Before anyone can see things like your exact location or event details, for example, you have to explicitly add them to the appropriate group.</p><p>The \u201cVIP\u201d group, which will likely only include family members \u2013 like a significant other, offers a slew of detailed information including call status, street level location (like Apple\u2019s \u201cFind My Friends\u201d), calendar event details and duration, time zone info and weather info.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1211028\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/main_features_lg.png?w=271&amp;h=534\" alt=\"main_features_lg\" width=\"271\" height=\"534\"></p><p>Meanwhile,\u00a0close friends\u00a0may be placed into the \u201cTrusted\u201d group, which lets them see a slightly less\u00a0detailed status, including regional location (e.g. \u201cCalifornia\u201d), free/busy information (as determined\u00a0by your calendar), time zone and weather info.</p><p>Of course, like many smart address books before it, Caret is only as good\u00a0as its network. That is, if your friends and family don\u2019t use the app, then you won\u2019t see their availability information.</p><p>That said,\u00a0if Caret\u2019s user base is able to grow, there are other neat tricks it can do. For instance, you can configure a custom status that pops up with you arrive at a pre-set location and then see which contacts are near you. This could make sense for when you\u2019re arriving at a big event, like a conference, concert, or outdoor festival, perhaps.</p><p>To encourage users to use\u00a0the app, Caret takes a page from competing\u00a0messaging apps and offer free VoIP calls that include the caller\u2019s name, location, distance from you and time zone.</p><p>The consumer-facing app itself is free, but the bigger vision for Caret is as a service platform. Through the Caret API, developers could integrate\u00a0\u201cInternet of Things\u201d devices like smart thermostats, home security systems, fitness wearables,\u00a0connected cars with Caret in order to do things like turn on the heat when you\u2019re nearing home, tell trusted contacts when you\u2019ve hit the road, inform friends not to call because you\u2019re sleeping, and so on.</p><p>Anka says he\u00a0founded the company in 2010, but didn\u2019t put together a team around Palo Alto-based Caret until October 2013, after he retired from LogMeIn.

The next step in the process is picking up your device at either the Mountain View, Los Angeles or New York City Google Campus.\u00a0Of course, you can opt to have them shipped to you if you\u2019re not in one of those areas, but what\u2019s the fun in that?</p><p>I picked up my Google Glass today in Mountain View and was told only that I would receive a bit of a walkthrough and proper fitting. I want to warn you, this isn\u2019t a review, there won\u2019t be any <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=-Hh5_Y9xrHg\">unboxing videos</a>, you can find the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/15/google-releases-full-glass-specs-full-day-battery-life-5mp-camera-720p-video-16gb-flash-memory-bone-conduction-transducer/\">technical specs here</a> and there will be no pass or fail grade on this first iteration of Google Glass. If you buy into the potential for the device, and, more importantly the platform, then you know that this will be a true exploration into what Google has come up with here.</p><p>Some will see this device as a fad, something that isn\u2019t really \u201cnecessary\u201d in today\u2019s world, and others will see this as the beginning of an adventure for users, developers and Google, of course. I tend to lean towards the adventure side, as it\u2019s not fully known what impact Glass will have on society, your day-to-day activities, or the future of technology and hardware.</p><p>I arrived at the Googleplex and a few members of the Glass team greeted me. It\u2019s been almost a year since Google\u2019s last I/O conference where 2,000 developers signed up to be a part of the Glass Explorer program, and this is naturally the day that they\u2019ve been waiting for.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130417_111359_200.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-801115\" alt=\"20130417_111359_200\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130417_111359_200.jpg?w=680&amp;h=502\"></a></p><p>When I sat down to unbox my Glass, I was shown the proper way that they should sit on my face. The glass itself, where the screen is projected, should sit above your right eye and not in front of it. It\u2019s easy to mess around with the nose pads to get the right fit. The second step is to pair your Glass with your device, using the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/15/googles-glass-companion-app-for-android-and-web-based-setup-wizard-are-now-live/\">MyGlass app that recently shipped</a>. Since Glass pairs to your phone through Bluetooth, the device is pretty much useless until that\u2019s done.</p><p>You log into the app using your consumer, not business, Gmail account, and then you\u2019re off to the races once you\u2019ve paired:</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot_2013-04-17-15-54-20.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-801100\" alt=\"Screenshot_2013-04-17-15-54-20\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot_2013-04-17-15-54-20.png?w=680&amp;h=408\"></a></p><p>Something to note, all of these screenshots are coming from the handy \u201cscreencast\u201d tool within the MyGlass app. It shows everything that you\u2019re seeing on Glass. You\u2019re paired, account is connected, Wi-Fi or mobile network is chosen, and you\u2019re ready to use Glass.</p><p>As you swipe your way through some of the screens on the touchpad with your finger, you\u2019ll notice Google Now cards (if you choose to turn them on), a settings screen, and of course, the all-important command screen that pops up after you say the magic phrase \u201cOk Glass.\u201d</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot_2013-04-17-15-27-15.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-801104\" alt=\"Screenshot_2013-04-17-15-27-15\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot_2013-04-17-15-27-15.png?w=680&amp;h=408\"></a></p><p>With these voice commands, you can Google things, find directions, send someone a message shoot a video or take a picture. There\u2019s also a button on the top of Glass that lets you snap photos and shoot video as well. The audio, which comes out right by your ear, is crisp and not too loud.</p><p>The Glass team tells me that looking at the screen takes some time to get used to.\u00a0Some of the folks who work at Google say it took them up to a week to be able to focus on the screen properly. Let\u2019s be honest, looking up and to the right isn\u2019t a natural movement for our eyes. I\u2019ve found that as I\u2019ve worn them longer, I can glance up pretty quickly and see what I need to see and go back to what I was doing.</p><p>One trick is to use the screencast function of the app so that you can understand fully where each screen goes and what it does.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with what Glass isn\u2019t. Glass isn\u2019t a replacement for your cell phone, since you have to pair the device with the one you have for cellular functionality. It\u2019s not a device for watching movies or YouTube videos and it\u2019s not going to replace your computer. You won\u2019t be able to read full search results on the tiny screen, but you\u2019ll be able to get to really relevant information quickly.</p><p>What Glass seems to be, in the few hours that I\u2019ve spent with it, is a device that picks up some of the things you do throughout your day and makes that information more easily accessible. Currently, the only built-in integration for a third-party service is Path.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130417_121414_9961.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-801140\" alt=\"20130417_121414_996\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130417_121414_9961.jpg?w=680&amp;h=502\"></a></p><p>For example, how many times a day do you pick up your phone to check the time or to see if you have any missed calls or text messages? I couldn\u2019t count the times that I\u2019ve wasted that arm motion, in the sense that it has taken attention away from things around me. Every single time you take your phone out, you\u2019re telling the people that are around you that you have no interest in interacting with them for at least 30 seconds while you dive into your phone. Now, am I saying that having a screen above your eye is any less socially awkward? No. But it lets you access the same information quicker without having to stop what you\u2019re doing.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_20130417_163634.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-801144\" alt=\"IMG_20130417_163634\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_20130417_163634.jpg?w=680&amp;h=395\"></a></p><p>If you look at Glass in its existing state, it\u2019s quite impressive that all of this was fit into a tiny package that sits on your face. Will I get weird stares for a while when I\u2019m out wearing them? Probably. Do I care? Not really. But <em>I do</em> care how it affects others, and that\u2019s something that nobody will be able to talk about for sure until these things are in the wild for a few weeks.</p><p>Now mind you, this is the Explorer Edition of Glass, and it comes with the barest bones of \u201capps.\u201d The real magic is going to be what developers start building on the platform.</p><p>This is where things get really interesting. As we covered last week, there are <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/10/the-glass-collective-is-born/\">already investors that are chomping at the bit</a> to put money into developers who are building apps on top of Glass. The possibilities are actually quite endless, starting from potential uses in hospitals for doctors to a new way for teachers to interact with their students.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot_2013-04-17-15-28-43.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-801132\" alt=\"Screenshot_2013-04-17-15-28-43\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot_2013-04-17-15-28-43.png?w=300&amp;h=180\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\"></a>As far as how we interact with the world around us, being able to take pictures from our own vantage point, without setting up a shot for perfect light or shade, is something that has yet to be uncovered. Glass can do that. Being able to join a Google+ Hangout and talk to your friends with nothing more than a device that sits on your nose is pretty cool, too.</p><p>It all goes back to the developers, though. They have the minds to push Glass forward as not just a geeky novelty, but as a platform to enhance our lives. I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it \u2014 this product has a lot of bumpy roads ahead of it. We have to assume that there are developers who can come up with big ideas, that consumers are ready for it and whether it can be at a price point that middle-America can afford. In its current developer-only state, it\u2019s not that hard to grasp how to use it once you get past having something new on your face.</p><p>This is only a first step, and it\u2019s going to be an interesting ride. Not only can I not wait to build my hands-free recipe app, I\u2019m looking forward to speaking with developers who are forward-thinking enough to see Glass for what it is \u2014 not a futuristic gadget, but something that can help us explore the world in a new way. It\u2019s going to take time, though. I mean, even my dog thinks it\u2019s weird:</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130417_151808_443.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-801125\" alt=\"20130417_151808_443\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130417_151808_443.jpg?w=680&amp;h=500\"></a></p><p><strong>If you\u2019re a developer who is working on, thinking about or are interested in building Glass apps, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:drew@techcrunch.com\">feel free to reach out to me</a>, as we tell the story of the platform together.</strong></p>", "title": ["A Day With Glass: First Impressions Of The Early Days Of Google\u2019s Latest Moonshot"], "author": ["Drew Olanoff"]},

Yet\u00a0it\u2019s there \u2014 on a side street blocks from the central train station \u2014 that a team of roboticists, neuroscientists, and graphics programmers\u00a0planted the seed that would become the\u00a0new artificial intelligence software developer, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thecuriousaicompany.com/\">The Curious\u00a0AI Company</a>.</p><p>Unlike other technologies that are <em>training</em> computers to understand the information they\u2019re receiving, the Curious AI programmers\u00a0are actually attempting to give computers a way to learn in an unsupervised manner \u2014 a process that mimics human cognition more closely, according to company co-founder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://valpola.kapsi.fi/publications/\">Harri Valpola</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe future of artificial intelligence is in machine learning and in how our brain works,\u201d says Valpola. \u201c[So far]\u00a0the successful stories have been about supervised deep learning. But it only works if you have huge amounts of labeled data. It\u2019s not machines learning by themselves, it\u2019s people training them. [But] the way our brain learns is more through unsupervised learning.\u201d</p><p>Valpola began\u00a0working at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning and robotics over twenty years ago as a research assistant in the lab of\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teuvo_Kohonen\">Teuvo Kohonen</a>, a pioneer of neural networks in 1993.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing neural networks, machine learning, and building brains ever since,\u201d Valpola says.</p><p>After nearly a decade researching neural networks, Valpola took the next step on the road that would lead him to launch Curious with his co-founders: Mathias Berglund, Timo Haanp\u00e4\u00e4, Tapani Raiko, Antti Rasmus<span class=\"gD\">. He turned to robotics.\u00a0</span></p><p>That meant a trip to Zurich and still more research under the tutelage of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhWwoaoxIyc\">Rolf Pfeifer</a>\u00a0at his robotics laboratory, before returning to Helsinki and launching Valpola\u2019s own robotics lab to incorporate\u00a0the work he\u2019d done with both machine learning and AI and robotics into a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://zenrobotics.com/\">single system</a>.</p><p>Valpola believes that \u2014 just like humans \u2014 \u00a0machines can learn by doing, and by doing things in an unsupervised manner. It\u2019s the thesis behind <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zenrobotics#/entity\">ZenRobotics</a>, an\u00a0automating waste recycling company and the first venture Curious AI undertook.</p><p>\u201cWe were building brains for robotics and at some point we decided that we knew enough and had developed enough technologies with processors and controllers,\u201d Valpola says. \u201cWe decided to start commercializing that, and that\u2019s why we started Zen Robotics.\u201d</p><p><img class=\"wp-image-836647 alignleft\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/zen-robotics.jpg?w=717&amp;h=479\" alt=\"zen-robotics\" width=\"717\" height=\"479\"></p><p>Although Curious AI\u00a0is starting with semi-autonomous robots that are sorting valuable material from trash in waste processing facilities, it\u2019s a harbinger for a more fully roboticized future, in Valpola\u2019s vision.</p><p>Indeed,\u00a0the applications extend far beyond sorting trash. One of the big problems with autonomous vehicles is getting programs to understand segmentation \u2014 or identifying and classifying objects in a group without having to label each different object \u2014 which Valpola says is where current technologies have stalled.</p><p>\u201cComputer vision is still struggling with segmentation and I think it\u2019s because people are trying to solve it the wrong way,\u201d says Valpola. \u201cIt\u2019s integrated with the rest of the deep learning machinery and we believe we can make a breakthrough there. Currently, in computer vision, segmentation is a big bottleneck.\u201d</p><p>But using ZenRobotics as an example, Curious\u2019 team of founders can already point to a real example where their technology appears to have solved the problem.</p><p>The technology was persuasive enough to line up an EUR800,000 ($1 million) seed investment for Curious AI from ZenRobotics backers Invus and LifeLine Ventures and newcomer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.balderton.com/\">Balderton Capital</a>\u00a0(which will rarely take a bet so early in a company\u2019s development).</p><p>Using that funding, Curious AI intends to sell its artifical intelligence software as a toolkit that can be applied at companies like<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gigaom.com/2014/01/29/google-isnt-the-only-company-working-on-artificial-intelligence-its-just-the-richest/\"> Google, Facebook, Nvidia, or IBM</a> \u2014 each of whom have their own deep learning and artificial intelligence programs.</p><p>\u201cThese companies can take these algorithms and create new things with them,\u201d says Valpola. \u201cWe are planning to demonstrate our technology in real time vision systems. That\u2019s the first milestone. Build a real time vision system that can be trained in a semi-supervised manner rather than label every frame.\u201d</p><p>But how does even developing real-time vision systems get computers to the point of cognition? The secret, says Valpola, is in refining the unsupervised learning systems of the programs.</p><p>\u201cThe artificial intelligence itself will develop new artificial intelligences,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to bootstrap that to get to the point where the artificial intelligence is at least as intelligent as us.\u201d</p><p>And it will require more work from an entire ecosystem of startup companies to make the singularity happen sooner rather than later.</p><p>\u201cThere will be many new startups that are taking up the opportunity of doing things in different ways once the machine intelligence is more than it is now,\u201d says Valpola. \u201cComputers are still damn stupid in the end.\u201d</p>", "title": ["Curious AI Wants To Make The Singularity A Reality"], "author": ["Jonathan Shieber"]},

{"date": ["2014-04-22"], "text": "<p>There\u2019s a conundrum facing software developers these days: Wearable tech is clearly an area of keen interest among consumers and industry watchers, but how to prepare for mass market adoption in this nascent space? There are still so many variables, so much left up in the air, that it\u2019s hard to pick any areas of investment with guaranteed return on investment. But <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://evernote.com\">Evernote</a> CEO Phil Libin has a warning for software companies taking a wait-and-see approach \u2013 if you do so, you risk being left behind.</p><p>Evernote is already developing or has developed software for Android Wear, Pebble, Google Glass, Samsung Gear and more, and Libin told me that while it\u2019s far too early to pick a winner, or to pretend that anything they\u2019re doing now will look at all like finished products available to a mature wearables market, the experimentation isn\u2019t considered optional at his company. And to look at just how broad Evernote\u2019s approach to the so-called wearables market is, and what that might encompass, you can look to the company\u2019s launch of its Market for physical goods last year, which at the time left many observers scratching their heads.</p><p>\u201cA big reason for why we even launched the Evernote Market over six months ago was to get experience designing for the real world,\u201d Libin explained. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for companies to be successful if they don\u2019t understand how to design for the physical world. The whole nature of these devices is that they\u2019re going to succeed or fail based on the experience that they give you, and the whole experience is very tactile and very tangible, it\u2019s not just sitting in front of a computer typing.\u201d</p><p>Working with companies that produce goods on partnerships isn\u2019t strictly about branding and name recognition; in fact, it\u2019s more about learning how a future of interconnected hardware (both wearable, and the kind that\u2019ll pervade every aspect of our lives) will work with and augment software. Evernote\u2019s goal is to be the ultimate productivity aid for knowledge workers, and in the future, fulfilling that role might require much more than just being a codex or repository for the storage and recall of traditional media.</p><p>\u201cEven the design work that we\u2019re doing on styluses and scanners and wallets and things like that, it\u2019s there to get our people thinking about designing for the real world,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do people interact with a watch? Is a watch really the right metaphor? How do people interact with wrist-mounted things? Where do people hold their hands?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not the end of the questions Evernote is asking, however. It extends beyond those\u00a0you might imagine a software company designing for platforms like those emerging in the smartwatch category would naturally ask itself. Libin says the wearable future won\u2019t limit itself to \u00a0just a shrunk down version of smartphone you wear on your wrist. There\u2019s a whole range of material science to think about, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of textures make sense? Can you give someone information based on tactile input, based on what something feels like? How do you think about shapes and colors? How do people move? How big is a backpack that\u2019s too big to take on a train? What if you change some aspect ratios, how comfortable are people doing things while they\u2019re sitting or standing?\u201d</p><p>Libin says he thinks a lot of companies will be caught unawares by this subtle but tectonic shift in how software gets made. It\u2019s a matter of an entire side to the art opening up anew, and that could require a change in perspective that some companies just can\u2019t manage.</p><p>\u201cThis whole art was largely irrelevant for software companies for the last few decades, and now it\u2019s going to become highly relevant. I think you\u2019re going to see companies flaming out left and right that just ignored this, and that just focus on what they have been focusing on and are then completely unprepared for this new world.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s still early days for the wearables market, however, and despite the recent upswing in activity by companies like Google and Samsung to exploit this space, it\u2019ll be years before we truly feel the impact of this latest swing in the tech industry. It\u2019s easy to see why others would be taking a wait-and-see approach given the volatility of the market at this early stage, but will failure to act sink some of the industry\u2019s longest sailing ships? Evernote thinks so, and it isn\u2019t about to be counted among those who miss this sea change.</p><p><small>Photo courtesy Flickr user <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/26087974@N05/\">Cory M.

{"date": ["2014-02-21"], "text": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.burstly.com/\">Burstly</a>, the makers of an in-app ad management platform called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.skyrocketapp.com/\">SkyRocket</a> and the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/05/democratize-the-data/\">parent company</a>\u00a0of\u00a0popular mobile app testing platform TestFlight, has been acquired, we\u2019re hearing. Though we\u2019re working to get more information on this now, including deal terms, our understanding is that Apple is the acquirer here.</p><p>We\u2019ve been pointed in Apple\u2019s direction by a few of sources, and it makes sense as several odd things have been going on with TestFlight in recent days.</p><p>On Wednesday, TestFlight announced it would be<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://help.testflightapp.com/customer/portal/articles/1450414\"> terminating Android support</a> as of March 21, for example, while also announcing that it was discontinuing its TestFlight SDK. According to support <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://help.testflightapp.com/customer/portal/articles/1452760\">documentation</a>, only existing teams will be able to continue to upload builds with the SDK. New users and those who have never uploaded the SDK are now being asked to remove it from their builds.</p><p>The company also shut down FlightPath, its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/testflight-and-burstly-launch-flightpath-closing-the-loop-for-mobile-devs-with-post-launch-analytics/\">mobile analytics solution that entered into beta last year</a>, following the Burstly/TestFlight tie-up. Links to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://testflightapp.com/flightpath/\">FlightPath</a> now redirect to the TestFlight homepage, and this seems to be a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/nachtien/status/436225813843677186\">recent</a> change.</p><p>FlightPath, which replaced the company\u2019s \u201cTestFlight Live\u201d solution announced at the time of the original acquisition, was part of the two companies\u2019 <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/05/democratize-the-data/\">bigger vision</a> to \u201cchange the app ecosystem\u201d by combining forces. The mobile analytics market is still young enough to make room for new players like what they had in store with FlightPath, so seeing it close up shop in under a year is very odd. And definitely not the kind of product change that should have flown under the radar.</p><p>Odder still is how these product announcements \u2013 which greatly impact the company\u2019s mobile developer user base \u2013 have been handled so far. There\u2019s been no mention of them on the TestFlight <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.testflightapp.com/changelog/\">changelog</a>, for example, no company blog post, no emails, and no mention of them on social media channels \u2013 that is, unless you count the replies to confused developers from @testflightapp, the company\u2019s main Twitter account. Developers are being asked to reach out directly to the company via an email form instead of being given a more useful public reply.</p><p>Burstly has a history of keeping its deals quiet, though. The company had actually acquired TestFlight in Q4 2011, but kept the news under wraps until former TechCrunch writer MG Siegler <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pando.com/2012/03/05/burstly-testlfight-live/\">broke the story</a> on PandoDaily in March 2012.</p><p>Before buying TestFlight, Burstly raised $7.3 million from Upfront Ventures, Rincon Venture Partners, Softbank Capital and others in seed and Series A funding.</p><p>What\u2019s interesting now is what Apple may have planned for the company and its engineers, who are already at Apple, we hear. By nature of Apple\u2019s closed platform, where apps have to go through stringent reviews before being published to the App Store, the company has allowed for an ecosystem of third-party mobile app-testing platforms like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.testflightapp.com/dashboard/\">TestFlight</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hockeyapp.net/features/\">HockeyApp</a> to thrive.</p><p>Some developers have worked around Apple\u2019s limitations by utilizing Apple\u2019s\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/enterprise/\">enterprise app deployment</a>\u00a0platform to work with a larger base of testers. And more recently, Apple tried to address the testing problem by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2013/11/12/apple-now-allowing-developers-to-generate-100-promo-codes-per-release-instead-of-just-50/\">expanding</a> the number of app promo codes from 50 to 100. The benefit here is that promo codes can be distributed to testers, like press and reviewers, before the app goes on sale for the general population.</p><p>We\u2019ve reached out to Burstly and Apple for comment, but haven\u2019t heard back.</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>Apple spokesperson\u00a0Kristin Huguet\u00a0provided the following, which is as close to a confirmation as Apple ever gets:</p><p><b style=\"line-height:1.625;\">Note:\u00a0</b><em style=\"line-height:1.625;\">This post was updated to clarify that the acquisition has already taken place, as opposed to being \u201cin process.\u201d The Burstly team is at Apple already, we hear.\u00a0</em></p>", "title": ["TestFlight Owner Burstly Acquired By Apple"], "author": ["Sarah Perez", "Ryan Lawler", "Darrell Etherington"]},

There are, of course, tons of song lyric sites floating around the Web, but the large majority of them are unofficial, or don\u2019t have the rights to be broadcasting free song lyrics to the public.</p><p>Founded in 2010, musiXmatch is a startup trying to build the largest database of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/insights/search/#geo=US&amp;cmpt=q\">legal</a> song lyrics on the Web. The startup is off to a good beginning, having collected 5.3 million songs to date, but not only is musiXmatch about becoming a database kosher with international rights management, it\u2019s developing an API that will distribute its lyrics to music publishers, services, OEMs, and app developers.</p><p>This means that musiXmatch\u2019s API allows both commercial entities as well as music lovers and developers to search lyrics using either unstructured queries or opensource identifiers, to use search-engine-friendly lyric displays without the worry of copyright infringement, get a complete list of performing artists, organized and filtered in a variety of ways, including biographies and images, and view a complete discography for each performing artist complete with release dates, tracks and cover art.</p><p>Thus, musiXmatch is hoping not just to be another site with annoying pop up adds full of stagnant, boring text \u2014 it\u2019s going after metadata, too, hence my (albeit perhaps reaching) comparison to IMDB.</p><p>musiXmatch works with songwriters and music publishers to assist in lyric distribution and monetization, providing them with reports on usage statistics and allowing them to manage content rights on a country-by-country basis \u2014 as well as to take advantage of its revenue-sharing model. The startup\u2019s API enables online music services to increase user engagement using officially licensed lyrics and music metadata and is available in 18 languages.</p><p>The platform\u2019s music matching algorithms serve both end users and music providers with accurate song lyrics and allows music lovers to access lyrics from their favorite music services as well as their personal music library. Not too shabby.</p><p>While musiXmatch has already partnered with BMG, Kobalt, Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony ATV Music, Harry Fox Agency, among others, it plans to use its new funding to continue adding strategic partnerships and expanding its business throughout the U.S., Europe, and Asia.</p>", "title": ["musiXmatch, An IMDB For Legal Song Lyrics, Raises $3.7 Million To Expand Globally"], "author": ["Rip Empson"]},

That was a \u201cnon-trivial decision,\u201d Evernote CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/phil-libin\">Phil Libin</a> said in an interview this week, as the app was bringing in a healthy revenue stream. But, he said, the change fits into Evernote\u2019s larger policy of making its core products free and charging dedicated users for extras.</p><p>Evernote has also tweaked Penultimate with a host of across-the-board updates such as a new UI design, handwriting search, sharper ink on retina displays, new languages such as Russian and Chinese, and of course a deeper integration with Evernote that also syncs your Penultimate data across other devices in which you use Evernote. </p><p>The two app updates put out by Evernote today represent two \u201ccompletely different philosophies\u201d for the company, Libin said.

Right now, the platform automatically integrates with products such as the Philips Hue lightbulbs and the Misfit Shine, with plans to integrate with Nest and IFTTT for other products. This ensures that the Awair is using every possible resource at its disposal to make sure you\u2019re breathing clean, healthy air.</p><p>To simplify the process, Bitfinder combines the preferences of the user towards what kind of air they want, as well as the algorithms that determine the various qualities of the air to give a combined Awair Score. It gives a little context to the state of the space without getting into the particulars.</p><p>The Bitfinder Awair is designed to look a lot like a speaker, said co-founder Ronald Ro, and should be able to go anywhere you\u2019d normally put a Bluetooth speaker. It has an old-school feel and is made with real wood. You can also hook up multiple Awair units to a single space to get a comprehensive readout of the home.</p><p>The device is currently available for pre-order for $149 per unit, with plans to ship in fall 2015.

We\u2019d guess that\u2019s not what he had in mind, though.</p><p>Musk also said that self-driving Tesla cars are around the corner.</p><p>Already, owners of Tesla\u2019s Model S models are expecting a\u00a0software update that will allow their cars to start driving themselves in a hands-free mode that Musk calls \u201cauto pilot.\u201d Musk told the Danish interviewer that\u00a0the software is still being beta-tested and will \u201chopefully go into wide release next month.\u201d</p><p>(A March New York Times story reported the software would be released this past summer.

Though only live since late spring 2014, Laurel &amp; Wolf has already served thousands of customers who pay a small, flat fee for access to high-quality design services from the company\u2019s hundreds of design partners.</p><p>The new funding was led by Charles River Ventures; Laurel &amp; Wolf has raised $5.5 million in total, which also includes investment from\u00a0Karlin Ventures, Upside Partnership and Draper &amp; Associates.</p><p>The idea for Laurel &amp; Wolf came\u00a0from Leura Fine, a long-time professional designer based in L.A. She saw there was a dramatic shift taking place around design, thanks to the inspirational boards and images being shared on sites like Pinterest and Instagram, alongside the growth and popularity of\u00a0a number of e-commerce sites that allow shoppers to\u00a0acquire great design at affordable prices.</p><p>But what hadn\u2019t changed was the interior design industry itself.</p><p>The designers she knew were still often struggling to make payroll and find work, while their potential customers worried either about the cost of design services, if money was a factor, or feared things like who to hire and trust, if finances were not an issue.</p><p>\u201cNinety-eight percent of people couldn\u2019t afford [interior design services] because of the way it\u2019s been traditionally priced. Or if they could afford it, they were terrified of it,\u201d Fine explains. \u201cThere were all these issues around the way it works, because it\u2019s been a very opaque business. So, this is something that really evolved out of me seeing a need in my own industry,\u201d she says.</p><p>With Laurel &amp; Wolf, the process for getting design help is simplified. Customers\u00a0pay a flat fee of $299, and in return receive around a half-dozen digital style boards from professional designers who create personalized looks for your home or office. These boards are based on\u00a0information you provide the service in advance, which includes taking a style quiz, sharing photos of your space, and marking items you want to keep in your final design.</p><p>After looking through the 2D digital style boards from designers, customers select their favorite and then work with that designer directly to make modifications. Using online tools, you can comment and annotate the design, providing feedback about what you liked and didn\u2019t, or asking about different color options, and so on.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1118022\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/styleboard.jpg?w=680&amp;h=526\" alt=\"styleboard\" width=\"680\" height=\"526\"></p><p>The end result is a shopping list that helps you make your home look like the one in the picture, and it sticks to whatever budget you had in mind, too. That means you can stretch your budget further than buying a package room deal at a local retailer, because you can mix-and-match items from different stores to get the best deal.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re definitely servicing\u00a0real people,\u201d says Fine, who notes that the average single-room budget is around $5,500. However, she adds, they\u2019re also working with more expensive designs, too, including those from Airbnb owners looking to upgrade their space so they can charge more per night, as well as larger, 7,000-8,000 square-foot homes, and even 10,000 square-foot-plus startup offices, for example.</p><p>Laurel &amp; Wolf generates revenue by keeping 20 percent of the flat design fee, and through affiliate revenue on online sales \u2013 most customers buy off their list from e-commerce retailers, not local stores. This summer, the company also plans to roll out a program that will leverage its growing footprint to source discounts on products it sells, and then give designers a portion of those sales.</p><p>Also in the works is a plan to introduce its own financing options through an integration with a third-party credit provider, upgrades to its online design tool to make it more interactive, and the launch of a native, mobile application.</p><p>The opportunity for the startup goes hand-in-hand with e-commerce\u2019s overall growth, too, it seems. Laurel &amp; Wolf already has a deal in the works with at least one online store to be listed on its website as the\u00a0recommended design service provider.</p><p>Now a team of 20 in L.A., which includes\u00a0co-founder\u00a0Brandon Kleinman, Laurel &amp; Wolf has serviced thousands of customers and has a team of 650 designers who have worked with the company\u2019s clientele across the U.S. and Canada.</p>", "title": ["Backed By $5.5 Million, Laurel & Wolf Brings Interior Design Into The Digital Age"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

Research is an action that everyone does on a daily basis: Writing an article, planning your holidays, decorating your apartment or just looking for some inspiration. Tools to save and collect all types of content have been a growing need since users tried to select and curate those parts interesting to them: Images, articles, videos, files, etc. But when you think about it, the real problem comes, not when saving, but when going back to that content. How you use, organize, share and understand that content is what matters. That experience is what makes the real difference. Its time to start to enjoy your research, projects and inspiration like you never did before. Icebergs is Co-Founded by Albert Pereta and Cesar Isern. After working between New York and Barcelona consulting and helping startups we decided it was time to \u2018burn the ships down\u2019 and start our own. The first Beta of Icebergs is going to launch on late January with an 8 members team.

{"date": ["2012-09-19"], "text": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a> is a great site that\u2019s done a lot for independent online video creation and publishing, but one thing that\u2019s been missing from its platform is a way for creators to make money directly from their movies. The video network now offers that, thanks to a new Tip Jar feature rolling out today. It allows Vimeo Plus or Pro members to add tip buttons to any video content, so that users can click and easily donate between $0.99 and $500. In tandem with a new pay-to-view service announced today but rolling out over the next several months, Vimeo wants to offer creators a way to develop complex, custom-fit revenue strategies.</p><p>The idea is to provide a complement for completed works to what Kickstarter offers in the planning and pre-production phase \u2013 something that harnesses the instincts of crowdfunding while also enabling continued patronage after a movie is made. Tip Jar is somewhat reminiscent of similar efforts by early creative web pioneers to use things like the PayPal Donate button to monetize, but unlike that solution, it\u2019s\u00a0incredibly\u00a0easy to set up, and for viewers, donating is a simple process of entering credit card info in the same window where the movie plays.</p><p>In an interview, Vimeo President Dae Mellencamp explained that Vimeo\u2019s intent has always been to give its\u00a0community members a way to make money via their work, and that this seemed like the right moment, and the right way to do so.</p><p>\u201cTip Jar allows users of a video that has it enabled to tip [the video] before during or after playback,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it \u2018crowdsourced revenue\u2019 for completed works, which we think is sort of the easiest way to understand it. When you think of the growth of crowdsourced funding and how successful that\u2019s been on the production front, it makes a lot of sense.\u201d</p><p>Kickstarter and other crowdfunding sites have definitely helped boost interest in creator-owned independent video content. The Film &amp; Video category is responsible for over $73 million of Kickstarter\u2019s total successful funding money, the largest category by far, and is second only to music in terms of current live projects, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats\">current stats</a>. Vimeo looking to build on that success makes sense not only for its creators, but also for the network itself, as the company will collect 15 percent of any tips that come in, passing on 85 percent to artists. Mellencamp admits that that could represent a new revenue path for Vimeo, but also says it\u2019s too early to tell at this stage in the game whether it\u2019ll be have a significant impact overall for Vimeo itself.</p><p>The second part of Vimeo\u2019s new monetization options is essentially a pay wall, but one that\u2019s very much left open to creators to decide how to implement. The pay-to-view features will be available to Vimeo Pro subscribers when it launches across the site in 2013, but the network is planning a staged rollout with select partners before then. Mellencamp says users will be able to mix and match pay-to-view with Tip Jar, in order to, for example, keep one episode in a series free and offer the rest behind a pay wall, or give a limited release free of charge for early adopters and potential evangelists before charging for content later. Vimeo will provide detailed analytics via their admin panel, as well as in the form of cumulative periodic wrap-up reports to provide a bird\u2019s-eye view of performance overall, so that creators can adjust their strategies, get feedback and see what works best.</p><p>Vimeo\u2019s path to monetization differs considerably from what YouTube provides its creators, which is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://youtubecreator.blogspot.ca/2012/03/monetize-lots-of-videos-at-once.html\">still basically a cut of ad revenue</a>. Mellencamp said that\u2019s because Vimeo first wants to cultivate a different kind of content, and keep the focus on content first without viewer annoyances like pre-roll or on-content ads, and also because the ultimate aim is to provide all of its creators with a way to gain a sizable revenue stream, something which the Tip Jar/pay wall approach might accomplish better for those with small but passionate followings than ad revenue share based on views or impressions.</p><p>One key element of Vimeo\u2019s new monetization element will be how quickly the network can bring them to its premiere partner platforms, including the Apple TV and smart TVs (it already works wherever Vimeo is viewable in a browser). Mellencamp says that making Tip Jar \u201cas broadly available as possible\u201d is a key goal for the network, however, and the web still represents the bulk of its traffic.</p><p>I think this is a significant change in Vimeo\u2019s overall model and approach, and the company is clearly doing its best to minimize impact on user experience. The Tip Jar is innocuous enough, and I see no reason it won\u2019t gain wide adoption if it actually results in conversions. How the introduction of opt-in, completely creator-controlled pay walls affects the network will be another question entirely and could result in a more fundamental change of the nature of Vimeo, one that the introduction of the pilot projects coming soon should give us an interesting early peek at.</p>", "title": ["Vimeo Offers Tips-Based Monetization For Videos, Creator-Controlled Pay Walls Coming Soon"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},
{"date": ["2013-04-10"], "text": "<p>Today, Google Ventures announced a partnership with two of the biggest technology venture capital firms in the world, Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins, on what they\u2019re calling the \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.glasscollective.com\">Glass Collective</a>.\u201d While this isn\u2019t a fund, the three firms will be sharing seed investment dealflow for entrepreneurs and developers who are working on Google Glass software and hardware. If one firm sees an interesting opportunity, it will go to the others with it. The hope of this collective effort is to kickstart the developer ecosystem for Glass and bring it to mainstream users as soon as possible.</p><p>Steve Lee, product lead on the Glass team, confirmed that\u00a0Google will start shipping,\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/10/glass-explorer-edition-to-ship-next-month-google-confirms\">hopefully within the next month</a>,\u00a0the Glass Explorer kits to developers\u00a0who showed interest in Glass when it was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/27/sergey-brin-demos-google-glass-at-io/\">introduced last year at Google I/O</a>. So the three firms want to get in front of the activity that is currently, and will be in the future, happening in the ecosystem. With the billions of dollars that the firms have, it\u2019s safe to say that they\u2019d like to corner the market on Glass investments immediately. This is similar to the approach that Kleiner Perkins took with its iFund, which has <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/02/kleiner-perkins-has-now-put-over-450-million-in-nearly-40-mobile-investments/\">invested more than $450 million into mobile applications</a>.</p><p><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/maris-doerr-andreessen3.jpg?w=640&amp;h=500\" alt=\"maris doerr andreessen\" width=\"640\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-797171\"><br>\nWhile the forming of the group doesn\u2019t guarantee that the two firms will participate in a round of funding for any given project, the firms do tend to invest in other companies together already, so sharing what they\u2019re seeing among one another makes sense. It was also made clear that there are no plans to bring in any other firms, so the \u201cGlass Musketeers\u201d will be going at this on their own.</p><p>During the announcement, Google Ventures\u2019 Bill Maris was joined by Marc Andreessen from Andreessen Horowitz and John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins. The three discussed their excitement for the immediate potential of Google Glass as a platform, not just a wearable computing product. The Glass API, called <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/11/google-details-glass-mirror-api-at-sxsw-shows-off-gmail-nyt-evernote-and-path-integrations/\">\u201cMirror,\u201d was announced and shown off at this year\u2019s SXSW</a>.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot_4_10_13_1_58_pm.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-796536\" alt=\"Screenshot_4_10_13_1_58_PM\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screenshot_4_10_13_1_58_pm.png?w=680&amp;h=527\"></a></p><p>Before the meeting started, we were able to test out the latest iteration of Glass, which has come a long way in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/20/google-finally-shows-of-google-glass-ui-announces-ifihadglass-purchase-campaign/\">just the past few months</a> from what I could tell. That fact, tied with the obvious implications for real businesses to form around Glass, made these firms want to jump in early.</p><p>Maris started off by discussing his introduction to Glass:</p><p>It didn\u2019t take much to get Andreessen and Doerr interested, as Maris says he barely got \u201cGlass\u201d out of his mouth before both said yes in separate phone calls. From those calls and discussion with the Glass team on how Google Ventures could get involved, the \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.glasscollective.com\">Glass Collective</a>\u201d was born. Doerr went on to say that this group felt it \u201cgetting the band together again.\u201d Kleiner Perkins was an early investor in Google, of course, and Doerr was also involved with Andreessen when he was working on the Mosaic web browser, which turned into Netscape, another Kleiner Perkins investment.</p><p>Doerr\u2019s excitement can be summed up in this statement:</p><p>Andreesen was more succinct, saying: \u201cYou put on Glass and you say yep, that\u2019s the future.\u201d</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/google-glass1.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-796511\" alt=\"google-glass1\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/google-glass1.png?w=300&amp;h=164\" width=\"300\" height=\"164\"></a>The recurring theme of this meeting, which Google co-founder Sergey Brin eventually rolled into on his bike, was that Google Glass is the next evolution of browsing the web and mobile devices, all wrapped up into one.</p><p>The possibilities for Glass do seem infinite. As far as applications are concerned, there are still those who feel like the device will face <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/google-glass-expect-widespread-usage-bans-over-privacy-concerns-7000012400/\">criticism from privacy experts</a>, citing the ability for rogue applications to be developed for nefarious activities. Today, these firms say that they will treat Glass investments like any other investment in that they won\u2019t be funding any application that isn\u2019t good for consumers in the end.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/gg.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-796414\" alt=\"gg\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/gg.jpg?w=300&amp;h=223\" width=\"300\" height=\"223\"></a>As far as what those applications could be, Maris, Andreesen, Doerr and Brin shared some of their ideas for Glass that could make an impact in the world and bring a bit more fun to it. Andreesen would like to see an interactive zombie game on the fun side, but feels like the implications for Glass\u2019 usage in healthcare, for surgeons and patients, could be huge.</p><p>Doerr agreed and added his hopes of seeing Glass used in the education sector to help remove some of the isolation in today\u2019s learning environment. The person who has spent the most time with Glass, Sergey Brin, would like to use Glass as a viewfinder for his digital SLR camera and tracking his heart rate and performance while riding his bike.</p><p>So far, the applications that have been conceived and built\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/15/google-announces-first-project-glass-hackathons-in-nyc-and-sf-will-detail-mirror-api/\">during Glass\u2019 early hackathons</a> have been promising, the Glass team said today.</p><p>The Glass Collective\u2019s first investment could be coming soon, as Maris stated that there are a few developers working on interesting things that might need some money to get going, and Doerr added that Path and Twitter are already thinking about the applications that they can build on top of the Glass device and platform.</p><p>With the experience and history of these three firms, it\u2019s safe to say that other collectives like this will have a hard time getting set up and launched in time to make early deals. When you have the ability, as an entrepreneur, to get access to three world-class investment firms, one of which has direct access to the Google Glass team, it will be hard to justify taking your idea elsewhere. One thing is for sure, Google Glass isn\u2019t going to be the easiest sell to consumers, as it takes some time getting your eyes used to seeing notifications pop up in front of your face. To be successful though, these firms don\u2019t think that it needs millions of adopters to get entrepreneurs excited about building things on the platform.</p>", "title": ["Google Ventures, Kleiner Perkins And Andreessen Horowitz Team Up As \u201cGlass Collective\u201d To Invest In Google Glass Ecosystem"], "author": ["Drew Olanoff"]},

Returns are a huge cost sink for sartorial e-tailers \u2014 Fits.me describes clothes returns as a \u201c\u00a37.4 billion problem globally\u201d \u2014 so the size of the business opportunity has\u00a0encouraged scores of startups to try their luck at\u00a0fixing the disconnect between what a shopper\u00a0thinks\u00a0will fit them and what actually fits.</p><p>Fits.me names its main competitors in the space as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/virtusize\">Virtusize</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/true-fit\">True Fit</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/metail\">Metail</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/clothes-horse\">Clothes Horse</a>\u00a0\u2014 but there are lots more.

Co-founder\u00a0Heikki Haldre is bullish about its prospects and dismissive of the competitive landscape \u2014 pointing to Fits.me\u2019s ability to offer not just size recommendations but also style preference by allowing users to select a snug, regular or loose fit option across various body parts. \u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/fits-me-closes-7-2m-series-a-to-aggressively-expand-its-virtual-fitting-room-tech-in-europe-start-prepping-for-u-s-push/screen-shot-2013-04-17-at-22-14-30/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-801003\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-801003\" alt=\"fits.me fit preference\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-17-at-22-14-30.png?w=300&amp;h=191\" width=\"300\" height=\"191\"></a></p><p>\u201cOn the fitting room, we are the only solution that can provide the retailers and the customers alike the visual information \u2014 how the clothing fits. There\u2019s no other solution in the market,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cFits.me today is commercially the only\u00a0successful solution that does address [the high number of clothes returns online] and resolves this for the clothing online retailers.\u201d</p><p>Fits.me has developed two products to sell to retailers. Its high-end Virtual Fitting Room\u00a0offering users robot mannequins that can be adjusted to take on different body shapes and sizes. The mannequins are then dressed in each garment and thousands of photographs are taken so that shoppers with corresponding body measurements can see a visualisation of a garment\u2019s fit displayed on a virtual model.</p><p>This system requires users to enter a set of body measurements in order to pull up the correct images from Fits.me\u2019s database. And with 1,500 to 2,500 photographs required per garment \u2014 and a cost that\u2019s in the \u201cmid to low \u00a3100s\u201d to capture all the data required for one garment in all its size permutations \u2014 it\u2019s not cost effective for every type of garment or scalable for every fashion retailer.\u00a0Fast fashion mass market retailers, for example, who opt to sell a lot of garments quickly and at relatively low cost with a high turnover of stock and styles, may not look like obvious Fits.me customers. (Its current customer list certainly looks weighted towards prestige/small collection brands.)</p><p>To bridge the scalability and cost gap, Fits.me has developed a second lower cost, photography-free system, called Fit Advisor (pictured below). Instead of\u00a0visualising the clothes on a virtual model, it advises the user which size to buy by comparing their body measurements to measurements taken directly from the clothes. The availability of that data varies by retailer, it said, with retailers generally likely to be able to most easily procure measurements from any own brand clothing lines they stock.</p><p>Fits.me said Fit Advisor is mostly being used in combination with its Virtual Fitting Room tech, with a retailer offering a portion of their garments within the virtual fitting room, but other (perhaps less expensive) items having only its measurement matching system.</p><p>\u201cThe majority of clients will be using Fit Adviser in conjunction with the Virtual Fitting Room,\u201d said\u00a0Fit.me\u2019s VP of sales, Pete Rankin. \u201cA lot of our clients have got ratios of say 10% of their product equals 90% of their sales. Or down to 30%: 70% and we\u2019ve focused the photographic version on those best sellers and worst returners, and then the long tail products we would then supplement with the Fit Advisor. Only one client so far has signed up for just the Fit Advisor.\u201d</p><p>Another way Fits.me can lower the cost of its SaaS to retailers is by aggregating garments that have the same sizing to reduce photography/processing costs, it added.</p><p>On the performance front, for the \u201cnormally\u201d 15%-20% of website users who opt to use its Virtual Fitting Room tech, Rankin said\u00a0its \u201cbenchmark\u201d data shows a doubling of the retailer\u2019s conversation rate, while the returns rate for these same users is divided by 2.5. It added that individual retailer performance can be better than the benchmark \u2014 with Pretty Green, for instance, reducing its overall returns rate from 13% to 3%.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/fits-me-closes-7-2m-series-a-to-aggressively-expand-its-virtual-fitting-room-tech-in-europe-start-prepping-for-u-s-push/screen-shot-2013-04-17-at-20-59-27/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-800906\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-800906\" alt=\"fits.me fit adviser\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-17-at-20-59-27.png?w=601&amp;h=360\" width=\"601\" height=\"360\"></a></p><p>Although it\u2019s currently relying on users to input their body measurements, Fits.me said it has a \u201ctechnology agnostic\u201d philosophy to capturing sizing data, suggesting that it could be open to using other technologies to do this in future. It cited rivals using web cams to capture body shape as an example of a type of tech that it believes is not currently accurate enough for it to be \u201ccomfortable\u201d using it, but which it could look to incorporate down the line if the tech improves.</p><p>The unspoken implication here is that Fits.me could be looking to gobble up some of its rivals \u2014 when or if their technology becomes interesting enough. \u201cAt this time we\u2019re looking at a number of different ways of increasing the solutions from our fit and sizing platform,\u201d said Rankin, declining to comment further when asked whether it is looking to make any acquisitions.</p><p>Looking beyond the problem of size and fit for online retailers, a possible future additional revenue stream for the business, once it has ramped up and gathered more sizing data, could come from monetising its database of body measurements in another way: by selling information about body size and fit preferences back to clothes-makers to help them make more saleable clothes. (What you could describer as \u2018big, medium and small data\u2019.)</p><p>\u201cLooking to a little bit longer term, as far as I know Fits.me is also the world\u2019s largest database of human body measurements and fit preferences. Now when we are resolving the biggest problem for the clothing ecommerce, the data that we\u2019re collecting helps the clothing manufacturers, clothing brands start producing clothing that fits more people not just in online channels, but also in brick and mortar sales. So Fits.me has quite an impact,\u201d Haldre\u00a0told TechCrunch.</p><p>\u201cVirtual fitting room itself is quite sizeable business \u2014 we\u2019re talking a million forecasted bookings \u2014 however I do believe our next step is the data business which will be even significantly bigger.\u201d</p>", "title": ["Fits.me Closes $7.2M Series A To \u201cAggressively Expand\u201d Its Virtual Fitting Room Tech In Europe, Start Prepping For U.S. Push"], "author": ["Natasha Lomas"]},

As I read it, one paragraph concerning the potential IPO of the company struck me:</p><p>I asked myself, is Twitter really the type of company that people would buy stock in on a public market? Would people really see the value in what Twitter provides in a way that moves past seeing what celebrities are up to? Would people be so afraid of Facebook\u2019s IPO performance that Twitter would tank?</p><p>Yes people will buy, yes they will see the value, and yes they will be afraid. But that doesn\u2019t mean Twitter\u2019s road to the IPO will be as rocky as some might think. There are a few reasons for this and these are the two that I go back to:</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/06/heres-why-twitters-road-to-an-ipo-wont-be-as-rocky-as-some-might-think/393375462_5f08776555_z/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-668989\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/393375462_5f08776555_z.jpg?w=200&amp;h=300\" alt=\"\" title=\"393375462_5f08776555_z\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-668989\"></a>There haven\u2019t been many companies that have figured out a way to build a backbone of communication and provide it for free. One could argue that Facebook does this, but it has already gone down the path of building in monetization efforts, like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/forget-saying-happy-birthday-to-your-friends-on-facebook-its-all-about-gifts-now/\">Gifts</a> and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/us-promoted-posts/\">$7 status updates</a>, that ask users to pay money out of their own pockets directly to them.</p><p>So far, Twitter hasn\u2019t shown that this approach is part of its strategy. I can\u2019t see a day when Twitter will act as a gateway between me and a brand or me and an audience and charge me money for it. It seems like a bulk of its revenue is coming from advertisers and brands who are trying to become a part of the conversation. From what I can tell, it\u2019s working.</p><p>If advertising were working so well for Facebook, I don\u2019t think that it would skip ahead so quickly to charging users for features. That\u2019s not to say that Facebook won\u2019t have success with this, but it\u2019s something that makes investors a bit shaky in the knees to conceptualize.</p><p>What Twitter has built is a ubiquitous service that is so ingrained in many people\u2019s daily lives that it\u2019s quite impressive how much the company has accomplished thus far. I mean, alongside Facebook, people who have an iPhone can tweet quite easily without ever downloading an app.</p><p>To me, Twitter is the next level of telephony or communication: It\u2019s a text message and a voice message, and it\u2019s like sending the world an email. And it\u2019s free. And I believe that it will stay that way.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/06/heres-why-twitters-road-to-an-ipo-wont-be-as-rocky-as-some-might-think/4673864499_288ebbbc6c_z/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-668992\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/4673864499_288ebbbc6c_z.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300\" alt=\"\" title=\"4673864499_288ebbbc6c_z\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-668992\"></a>In a way, Twitter is like a cable provider, made up of channels of content and interactions. If you think about Twitter in that way, you can see how valuable the company can really be. When I want to interact with the NFL, I can hop on and see what players, coaches and owners are saying. I can also see what announcers and pundits are saying, all in one place. All I have to do is \u201ctweet-surf.\u201d</p><p>Sure, along the way I\u2019ll see some ads, but that\u2019s par for the course. The ads aren\u2019t intrusive and they fit within the Twitter experience. In that way, Twitter is not only a communication channel and utility, but also an entertainment platform, and I\u2019m used to ads on entertainment platforms.</p><p>Facebook? Not so much. It feels awkward to see ads all over the place within the Facebook experience. They\u2019re all formatted differently and are rarely like the pieces of content you see from your friends. On the other hand, Twitter\u2019s 140-character model fits right in, especially if you\u2019re on a mobile device.</p><p>I disagree with Bilton that Twitter is Facebook\u2019s \u201csocial media twin,\u201d because I think the company is better positioned than any other that I\u2019ve seen in a long time to take communication to the next level. Facebook connects people, but there are certain features that create unwanted friction for communication.\u00a0Twitter is extremely easy to navigate, and anyone can do it without getting frustrated.</p><p>There\u2019s value in Twitter that some might not see or understand yet, but as I stated last week, the company provides the world with a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/first-2012-presidential-debate-saw-10-3m-tweets-and-gave-politics-a-new-dimension/\">\u201c4th Dimension\u201d that is a part of the future of communication</a>.

In his view, that\u2019s because many of them simply don\u2019t know they have performance issues. They understand design and how to create a great consumer experience, but have no experience running a global network.</p><p>Neumob\u00a0says it can speed up content delivery to apps by 40 to 400 percent. Unsurprisingly, the service\u2019s impact is typically more noticeable on slower connections than on a fast LTE network.</p><p>The company plans to use the new funding to accelerate its go-to-market and customer acquisition strategies. Accel partner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.accel.com/team/bay-area/all/rich-wong\">Rich Wong</a>, who also led the firm\u2019s investments in the likes of Admob, MoPub and Airwatch, will take a seat on Neumob\u2019s board.

The company offers a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.neumob.com/pricing\">free tier</a> for testing its service, but\u00a0it doesn\u2019t publish pricing for its enterprise plan.

Musk said that a fully autonomous driving system might actually only be as little as a year away, but noted that regulation will lag several years behind tech that actually makes such a system possible. Still, he said that Tesla wants to be the leader in autonomous cars, even though it\u2019s currently seen as an electric vehicle maker.</p><p>Musk also said we\u2019ll actually start taking self-driven cars \u201cfor granted\u201d much faster than many may realize, and noted that one of the key areas of focus for the company is actually on protecting any future self-driving software from malicious attacks. In addition to physical controls for manual override, Musk says there will\u00a0be additional levels of security on driving systems, so that even if infotainment software is hacked, vehicle drive systems remain unaffected.</p><p>The Tesla executive was discussing autonomous vehicle tech at Nvidia\u2019s event because Nvidia is putting resources into processor and system-on-a-chip technology that can be used as the brains of in-car intelligence systems. At this year\u2019s CES, Nvidia showed off two brand new computing platforms for vehicles, including <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/04/nvidia-announces-the-drive-cx-its-computing-platform-for-cars/\">Drive CX and Drive PX</a>, which focus on the infotainment and object recognition and imaging portions of vehicles respectively.</p><p>Musk\u2019s parting message was about how committed Tesla is to providing the right kind of security necessary to protect autonomous vehicles from malicious attacks, and the impression left by its focus on that aspect of the forthcoming tech does indeed suggest they\u2019re further along than many may realize to practical implementations of self-driving cars. The Tesla chief executive also stressed that offering self-driving tech will save a lot of motorist lives down the road.</p><p>During the Q&amp;A, Musk also teased the announcement that Tesla is making tomorrow, which he previously tweeted will <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/15/elon-musk-says-tesla-model-s-range-anxiety-will-end-with-a-software-update/\">eliminate \u201crange anxiety\u201d for all Model S</a> vehicles.

Clearly then, this is not a course for beginners, but for advanced developers who want to add</p><p>Just like Udacity\u2019s other degree programs, students can watch all of the video content for free, but if they want to get a certificate and access to teaching assistants, they will have to pay a fee, which is $200 per month for this course.</p><p>As Sebastian Thrun, Udacity\u2019s co-founder and CEO told me ahead of the announcement, developers will have to finish six courses and a number of projects to get their degree. One of those courses, for example, will ask the students to use the Spotify API in an app. The focus here, as with many of Udacity\u2019s other programs, is on practical knowledge and in many ways, the projects are far more important than the actual courses.</p><p>\u201cWe want to get them to the point where they can show how good they are through their work and not through a multiple choice test,\u201d Thrun said. \u201cIt\u2019s best to think of this as the stuff that Google wants its developers to know.\u201d</p><p>Completing the degree should take between six and nine months, but while the starting date is set, students can finish their courses and projects at their own pace.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1163571\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/google-play-services.png?w=1024&amp;h=369\" alt=\"Google Play Services\" width=\"1024\" height=\"369\"></p><p>To show its commitment to this project, Google will invite 50\u00a0students to a three-day summit in Mountain View at the end of the year. This summit will include a hackathon, as well as meetings with hiring engineers, so Google clearly plans on hiring at least a few of the students in this course.</p><p>In addition, Google has partnered with the government of Egypt to localize the six Android courses that are part of this degree into Modern Standard Arabic. For the first time in Udacity\u2019s history, this doesn\u2019t just mean subtitling the videos, but actually adapting all of the courses\u2019 content to one specific region.</p><p>Google will offer 2,000 scholarships for students in Egypt and host job fairs and sessions for students there. Thrun noted that Udacity sees Egypt as a great stepping stone to bring the course to students around the Arabic-speaking peninsula and that bringing good education \u2014 and the good jobs it will hopefully enable students to get \u2014 \u201ccould reduce the number of wars\u201d in the area.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/io2015/\"><img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/io2015-banner.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>", "title": ["Google Partners With Udacity To Launch Android Development Nanodegree"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},

It\u2019s available for the web and both Android and iOS apps.</p><p>It\u2019s kind of like Timehop and Facebook\u2019s memories \u2014 but not really.

Perry explained that this particular feature saw the light of day because it was fun: \u201cThe biggest reason why I\u2019ve been championing this feature is the amount of joy that I\u2019ve gotten from my groupings.\u201d</p><p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1198624\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/21.png?w=169&amp;h=300\" alt=\"2\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\">I have over 20K\u00a0pictures stored on Google Photos and it\u2019s a service I visit once every few weeks, at best. Most of the reason for that is because I forget it exists, and I have to imagine that most of the other people who use the service would say the same.</p><p>Dropping little hooks into the product to draw people back is pretty smart, especially when you\u2019ve chose, as Google apparently has, to stop focusing on the social components of Google Photos. Sure, you can share a photo, animation or collection with someone, but it\u2019s not the same as being tagged on Facebook or Instagram, which is retention candy.</p><p>Speaking of sharing, Google Photos will now let you push an animation out to Facebook as a GIF and to Instagram and WhatsApp as a video. Again\u2026just social enough to get by.</p><p>The rediscover feature doesn\u2019t come without its issues, though, mostly issues that follow Google Photos as it stands today. A cool part of Google Photos search is that you can search via people, places or things. It\u2019s nifty to search for \u201cdog\u201d and then have every photo that has anything resemble a dog come back as a result.</p><p>However, sometimes there are certain things, or people, that you\u2019d rather not have come up in search or Google Photos spend time on animating. Say, ex-girlfriends of boyfriends, etc. You get the idea.</p><p>Perry tells me that this is something on the team\u2019s mind, but there are currently no features in place that let me exclude something that\u2019s been grouped on Google Photos. That\u2019s a problem with any \u201cmemory\u201d feature or service, because you usually don\u2019t know what\u2019ll trigger you until it does. The feature is opt-out, but sadly not customizable.</p><p>Nothing\u2019s perfect, right?

He told us the prices are a \u201csweet spot\u201d based on deep studies of each market.</p><p>Spotify does come for free, but it premium users will be able to use its mobile apps, and get functions like offline caching, where songs are stored in devices and can be played without an Internet connection. Premium users also listen at 320 kbps, while free accounts stream at 160 kbps.</p><p>In an interview, Krishnan said Spotify has 24 million \u201cactive\u201d users (he couldn\u2019t define what \u201cactive\u201d means in Spotify terms), and 6 million of those are paying. In comparison, fellow US music streaming site, Pandora, said recently that it has a base of about<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/09/pandora-surpasses-200-million-registered-users-140-million-access-via-mobile/\">\u00a0200 million users</a>, of which 70 million log in each month.</p><p>Spotify\u2019s arrival in Asia marks one of the first times a paid streaming service has come to the region. Others such as Netflix and Pandora are missing. Users outside of the US used to be able to access Pandora by registering with a US postal code, but the service\u00a0had to comply with DMCA regulations, and finally\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2007/05/02/pandora-to-shut-out-non-us-users-thursday-evening/\">closed its doors to non-US users</a>\u00a0in 2007 through IP filtering.</p><p>Krishnan would not give specifics on the deals made in Asia, but said that Spotify\u2019s size makes it more of a force to reckon with during negotiations with industry execs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around for five years. In the past four years, we gave back $500 million to the music industry. This year, we will give back another $500 million. Having reached this scale, we\u2019re now taken seriously,\u201d he said.</p><p>Media providers have been nervous coming into Asia because of piracy concerns.\u00a0He acknowledged that piracy continues to be an issue here, but said that a premium service\u2019s ability to offer a more convenient way to get content without going through the hassle of BitTorrenting a file would trump piracy.</p><p>Of course BitTorrent is free, and you could theoretically capture a streamed track in all its 320 kbps glory, but he said that free accounts would address that sort of behavior, and the premium accounts are there for people more serious about their music.</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019re in town, people have a way to access free legal music. We\u2019re\u00a0confident that our presence will revitalize the industry,\u201d he said.</p><p>Besides piracy issues, a potential expansion to new markets with the risk that few may sign up for a subscription can be costly for middlemen services like Spotify, amid rising content prices from rights owners. In February, Pandora indicated that\u00a0it paid $65.7 million for its content in the third quarter last year, and that per-track royalty rates have shot up more than 25 percent over the past three years. It also said it expects rates to increase by another 16 percent by 2015.</p><p>Spotify has a Hong Kong office, where Krishnan is based, and it is currently hiring\u00a0sales and consumer marketing execs in its brand new Singapore office.</p>", "title": ["Spotify Makes Its First Moves Into Asia Via Singapore, Hong Kong And Malaysia; Latin America Via Mexico; And Four More In Europe [Update]"], "author": ["Victoria Ho"]},

Everybody else can also start working on apps based on the documentation but won\u2019t be able to test them.</p><p>This <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/glass/v1/reference/\">first version of the API</a>, which will allow developer to write what Google likes to call \u201cGlassware,\u201d is still relatively limited and the most advanced feature developers get access to is probably the Glass wearer\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/glass/location\">location</a>. Because every application communicates with Glass through Google\u2019s servers, the API provides developers with a set of RESTful services and is completely cloud-based and none of the code will actually run on Glass itself.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-799255\" alt=\"timeline-strip\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/timeline-strip.png?w=983&amp;h=180\" width=\"983\" height=\"180\"></p><p>At its core, the API allows developers to send and receive information from Glass devices.\u00a0Using the API looks to be relatively straightforward, though also a bit limited. Users will subscribe to new app from the developer\u2019s website (and Google has launched a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/glass/downloads/\">set of icons</a> developers can use on their sites for this, too).</p><p>Google currently offers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://glass-java-starter-demo.appspot.com/\">starter projects</a> for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/googleglass/mirror-quickstart-java\">Java</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/googleglass/mirror-quickstart-python\">Python</a> developers, as well as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/glass/downloads/\">client libraries</a> for Go, PHP, .NET, Ruby and Dart.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/15/google-releases-glass-mirror-api-developer-guides-details-best-practices/send_to_glass_64x64/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-799256\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-799256\" alt=\"send_to_glass_64x64\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/send_to_glass_64x64.png?w=64&amp;h=64\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\"></a>The API will give developers the option to communicate with users through timeline cards, which can include text, rich HTML, images and video. These timeline cards are not unlike Google Now cards on Android and can be bundled into packages \u2013 and users can navigate between them \u2013 or they can come as stand-alone cards.</p><p>The API also provides developers with the ability to add <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/glass/timeline#user_interaction_with_menu_items\">menu items</a> to their apps. These, Google says, can be system commands like \u201cread aloud,\u201d but developers can also write custom commands for their specific apps that users can bring up through the menu system or through voice commands.</p><p>As for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/glass/ui-guidelines\">user interface</a>, Google gives developers the option to use their own custom HTML, but the Glass team also provides developers with a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mirror-api-playground.appspot.com/assets/css/base_style.css\">base CSS file</a>. As Google notes, \u201ccrafting your own template gives you the power to control how your content is rendered, but with that power comes responsibility.\u201d Because of this, Google \u201cstrongly encourages\u201d developers to use its own template.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/glass/media-upload\">Photos and videos</a> (H.264 and H.264 baseline) should have a 16\u00d79 aspect ratio and should have a resolution of about 640x360px (that\u2019s also the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://support.google.com/glass/answer/3064128?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3063354\">maximum resolution of the Glass display</a>). Audio can be delivered in the AAC and MP3 formats.</p><p>Given that Glass is a new concept, Google also posted some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/glass/overview#what_makes_great_glassware\">general guidelines</a> for how apps should interact with Glass, though it\u2019s not clear if the company plans to enforce any of these directly.</p><p>Developers, Google says, should make sure they apps are designed with glass in mind and should always test their apps on Glass before releasing them. The glass experience should also never get in the user\u2019s way and apps shouldn\u2019t annoy users with frequent and loud notifications. Apps should also focus on real-time notifications and apps should react to a user\u2019s action as soon as possible. Most importantly, given that Glass is meant to be worn all day, developers should not surprise users with \u201cunexpected functionality.\u201d</p><p>Overall, many developers will surely feel as if Google is limiting how much they can do with Glass, but it\u2019s worth remembering that this is only a first release and chances are that Google will make more features available to developers in the future.</p><p>Here are a few of the videos Google posted today that explain some of the Mirror API\u2019s features in more detail:</p>", "title": ["Google Releases Glass Mirror API Developer Guides And Details Best Practices, API Remains In Limited Preview"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},

That company, which recently launched in the Bay Area in public beta, is looking to grow quickly thanks to $5 million in new funding from Redpoint Ventures and other investors.</p><p>If you\u2019ve ever tried to buy or sell a used car, you know how frustrating it can be. Sellers frequently take low offers from dealerships or underprice vehicles they try to sell themselves, while buyers can find themselves overpaying \u2014 or worse, buying a car and having it fall apart soon afterward.</p><p>Beepi seeks to alleviate those issues by creating a peer-to-peer marketplace for used cars in which sellers can list their cars and get a price that is guaranteed to be above what they might have received from a dealership. After a seller attempts to list their car, Beepi will make an initial offer which it calculates at $1,000 above what dealerships might offer.</p><p>But that\u2019s just the lowest price a seller might receive. After inspecting the car, the Beepi team will spend the next 30 days trying to sell it to interested buyers. If they don\u2019t succeed, Beepi will buy the vehicle for the original price quoted.</p><p>Meanwhile, buyers can take heart in knowing that the cars listed have gone through an intensive 185-point inspection from certified technicians. They also receive a 10-day, no-questions-asked return policy on the cars they agree to buy, as well as a full three-month, 3,000-mile warranty on all parts and service.</p><p>All payment processing and title transfer is handled by Beepi, which takes a 9-percent cut of the transaction. Buyers can pay through a bank account transfer or use up to five credit cards to purchase a vehicle.</p><p>If for whatever reason a buyer isn\u2019t satisfied and wants to return the car, the seller need not worry \u2014 Beepi will buy the car back and then seek to sell it all over again.</p><p>While the marketplace has been in beta since February, it\u2019s seen a solid amount of interest, all of which has come through word of mouth. The Beepi team is buying about two cars a day, and it currently has more than 5,000 buyers who have registered with the platform.</p><p>But right now Beepi is only serving the San Francisco Bay Area \u2014 something it hopes to change soon. To that end, the company is announcing it has raised $5 million in a Series A round of funding led by Redpoint Ventures, with participation from OLX founder Fabrice Grinda, iVillage co-founder Tina Sharkey, Homeaway co-founder Brian Sharples, former Loopnet CEO Rich Boyle, and Silicon Valley Bank.</p><p>Along with the new round of financing, Redpoint\u2019s Jeff Brody will be joining Beepi\u2019s board of directors. The company had previously raised $1.2 million in seed funding.</p><p>Beepi currently has 15 people between its engineering, operations and inspections team. With the new funding, it will look to grow that number to improve its technology and scale up operations.</p><p><small>Photo Credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/28402283@N07/4195747110/\">\u201cCaveman Chuck\u201d Coker</a> via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://compfight.com\">Compfight</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\">cc</a></small></p>", "title": ["Beepi Raises $5 Million From Redpoint To Simplify Buying Or Selling A Used Car"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

The first 2012 Presidential Debate was the most tweeted about political event in company history. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/another-record-twitter-circle-jerk/\">Whether you care or not</a>, this is significant and worth noting.</p><p>We\u2019re seeing a shift in not only media, but in major historical moments like political campaigns. What Twitter does is add a new dimension of participation, allowing people from all over the world to share their thoughts and feelings in real-time about something that\u2019s really important. In this case, it\u2019s the next President of the United States.</p><p>Here\u2019s what Twitter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.twitter.com/2012/10/dispatch-from-denver-debate.html\">had to say about tonight\u2019s action</a>:</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/first-2012-presidential-debate-saw-10-3m-tweets-and-gave-politics-a-new-dimension/debate-1-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-667067\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/debate-11.jpeg?w=640&amp;h=360\" alt=\"\" title=\"debate (1)\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-667067\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p>What Twitter has done is removed the political trends and influence from the hands of journalists and placed it into the hands of regular folks like my Mom and friends in Philly. You don\u2019t need a blog to be passionate and informative, you don\u2019t have to be someone \u201cspecial\u201d with publishing rights at a big important publication like my stupid ass to make a difference.</p><p>All you have to do is be you. Tonight, I \u201cmet\u201d a bunch of really smart, funny and insightful people during the debate. I also found some people that annoyed and challenged me, which is equally awesome.</p><p>We don\u2019t have to wait for FOX to tell us what was \u201cimportant\u201d during the debates, because WE get to decide\u2026as it happens, and that better scare the shit out of networks. I don\u2019t have to wonder why Twitter is signing media deals left and right, it\u2019s the networks that want to work with them, not the other way around.</p><p>Watching the debate on TV with the latest iteration of Twitter was like wearing 4D glasses. I saw things I\u2019d never seen before, heard things I\u2019d never heard before and met people I\u2019d never met before. The walls fell down, and we had open discussions, laughed and created Big Bird memes. Real decisions could have been on hard-hitting political agendas for voters, and we all worked it out and explained it to one another.</p><p>In my opinion, the format and moderation of the debate were pretty bad. Future debates can learn from this, because networks will see the reactions from us, the viewers, in both real-time and in chronological fashion.</p><p>That. Is. Powerful.</p><p>I could be snarky about how Twitter touts numbers and engagement like this, but I won\u2019t\u2026because it gets me excited for the future of communication.</p>", "title": ["First 2012 Presidential Debate Saw 10.3M Tweets And Gave Politics A New Dimension"], "author": ["Drew Olanoff"]},

Starting today, Opera will roll out Max to these pre-registered Android users in the U.S. on a first-come, first-served bases. Pre-registered European users can also install it today (there doesn\u2019t seem to be a cap for them).</p><p>Opera Max effectively takes the compression technology the company developed to power its Opera Mini mobile browser and the \u201cturbo\u201d mode in its desktop apps and extends it to all of Android. The app sets up a VPN connection to Opera on your phone that is activated every time you switch from your home WiFi network to the cell network. All your non-encrypted data is then routed through Opera\u2019s servers and compressed there.</p><p><img class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-961999\" alt=\"Screenshot_2014-02-20-22-49-14\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/screenshot_2014-02-20-22-49-14.png?w=383&amp;h=680\">If you\u2019re on a metered plan, having Opera compress most of the images, videos and text you pull in over the cell network sounds like a great idea, as long as you are okay with the potential privacy tradeoff of having all your data go through Opera\u2019s networks.</p><p>I\u2019ve been testing the app for the last week and it\u2019s a pretty seamless experience. You install it once and just forget about it from then on. It just works.</p><p>I did not notice any major increase in lag when using the app and Opera seems to be pretty conservative when it comes to image compression, because I\u2019m having a hard time finding any compression artifacts.</p><p>You can always go back into the app and turn it off, but I\u2019ve never quite felt the need to do so. Otherwise, the Max app just sits in the background and keeps track of your data usage.</p><p>Opera says if you are a heavy Flipboard, Vine and Instagram user, you can expect to save about 50 percent of your bandwidth by using Max. Based on my experience, that sounds about right. My savings in Instagram were actually quite a bit higher than 50 percent without any noticeable decline in image quality because of the compression.</p><p>If you are mostly surfing the web when you are out and about, though, you may not see any major differences (unless you spend most of your time on very image-heavy sites). Of course, if you are mostly in the Facebook app or email, chances are you are on an encrypted connection, so all your traffic will bypass Opera\u2019s servers anyway.\u00a0In daily use, my savings averaged out somewhere between 25 and 35 percent.</p><p>Still, Max can definitely help you get more mileage out of your mobile plans and may be especially useful if you are travelling internationally and only have a relatively small data allowance.</p><p>One thing Opera didn\u2019t quite clarify in its teaser, though, is that Max doesn\u2019t quite come for free. During the beta period, Max will remain free. You may see the \u201cdays of savings left\u201d meter in the app and you will have to go into the app to charge up for another week for free. After the beta period ends, though, Opera plans to give users the option to either see one ad per day of savings or to pay $1 per month. That seems like a pretty fair price and if you are on a metered plan, that $1 may just pay for itself.</p>", "title": ["Opera Launches Its Max Data-Savings App For Android"], "author": ["Frederic Lardinois"]},

The company also rolled out a new section of its website called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.glowing.com/stories\">glowing.com/stories</a>, dedicated to the success stories of people who have conceived while on Glow (the feature image is one of the photos shared to the site.) The entries are pretty touching, and they show a personal impact not often seen in consumer tech.</p><p>Also today, Glow issued an update to its iOS app and a new feature called Glow Community, which is a social space to allow couples who are trying to conceive and parents-to-be to share their experiences. The updated app also has some revamped calendar features that purport to help users track their fertility with more precision.</p><p>Max Levchin has said that his goals for Glow go much farther than what we see on the surface. Levchin\u2019s larger vision with HVF, the umbrella company that Glow is operating under, is to use machine learning and big data to solve the world\u2019s big problems, particularly those concerning healthcare. Pregnancy is just the first piece of the puzzle.</p><p>Levchin talked to TechCrunch TV about what inspired him to launch Glow at the app\u2019s launch in August.

{"date": ["2015-05-31"], "text": "<p>Ignorance has been a <em>fait accompli</em> throughout the history of human society. There was never enough information about the world and how it functions, and even when we had it, few people had access. Whole branches of knowledge could be lost or simply stagnate, like much of science and mathematics in the European Dark Ages.</p><p>The internet changed all that. Data is everywhere, and knowledge is accessible on almost any subject imaginable with just a few clicks. Suddenly, we went from people ignorant of our own ignorance to content consumers struggling to keep up with the information all around us.</p><p>We will never stop being the deer in the headlights of knowledge. We shouldn\u2019t celebrate ignorance, but neither can we cure it. Instead, students \u2013 hopefully aided someday by a new generation of education startups \u2013 need to learn how to navigate in a world where the frontier of knowledge is rapidly expanding and dynamic. We need to inculcate purpose-driven learning and move away from a model of slurping up all the data in the world.</p><p>When pundits describe data in the 21st century, they often resort to the flood metaphor, describing how we are \u201cinundated\u201d or \u201cawash\u201d with data. It is true that the internet has given us almost unlimited and practically free access to the sum of all human knowledge in a way never before seen in history.</p><p>The flood metaphor breaks down pretty quickly though upon deeper inspection. Data doesn\u2019t just rush flow by us as we struggle to stay anchored above the deluge. Rather, we have built sophisticated tools to filter through that data and find the pieces that we are most interested in.</p><p>Yet, we still feel so overwhelmed by all of this. We are so concerned about our next email or text message that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/topic/product/apple-watch/\">we have to buy special devices for our wrists</a> just to make sure we aren\u2019t falling behind. It\u2019s no better at work, where a majority of executives <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.avanade.com/~/media/documents/research%20and%20insights/big%20data%20executive%20summary%20final%20seov.pdf\">feel completely powerless to handle the roaring current of data flowing in</a> (I\u2019m metaphorically guilty now).</p><p>The challenge is that most of us aren\u2019t actually that good at learning. Sure, we can seek out facts, read news articles and tweets, and analyze tough problems. The software industry in particular is filled with autodidacts who can learn both the higher-level architecture of a massive computer system and the extremely nuanced implementation details required to run it. Data is abundant, and we can consume all of it given enough time.</p><p>Data is not knowledge however, and knowledge is not wisdom.</p><p>I am reminded of one of my \u201cfriends\u201d* who years ago used to constantly click on the random article button on Wikipedia and ingest the articles as quickly as possible. He was considered smart by many people, even brilliant by some who marveled at the level of his know-how. In the end, that data was superficial, enough to keep a conversation going with a specialist but without the ability to fully engage on a topic.</p><p>We can consume all the facts in the world and still not comprehend what is really going on. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://digiday.com/publishers/explainer-rise-explanatory-journalism/\">The rise of explanatory journalism</a> \u2013 pushed aggressively by Vox and several other internet publications \u2013 is a partial antidote to this problem. However, we are only moving from data to knowledge, and we still haven\u2019t found wisdom.</p><p>One of my professors once described education as a fraction. The numerator is the knowledge we know about the world, and the denominator is our understanding about all of the knowledge that exists in the world. He argued that grade school equally expanded the numerator and denominator, and that college expanded the numerator at a slightly faster clip, giving everyone confidence.</p><p>The punch line was that getting a doctorate degree would only expand the denominator, which is why after five or more additional years at a university, people feel dumber than when they first started.</p><p>One reason we feel overwhelmed by all of this data is that we suddenly know how much we <em>don\u2019t</em> know about the world. Our collective denominators have expanded rapidly in the last twenty years, without a concomitant increase in our own base of knowledge. We are constantly being confronted with stories we know nothing about, in countries we weren\u2019t even truly aware existed.</p><p>We have to accept our present condition: we will always be more ignorant than knowledgeable about the world. Our societies are too complicated and the human lifespan is too short to ever hope to try to bridge that gulf.</p><p>Instead, we need to accept ignorance and handle it graciously. That doesn\u2019t mean we should revel in our ignorance, but we shouldn\u2019t be bothered when we don\u2019t know the latest trend or some news story, nor should we judge others as \u201cstupid\u201d if they don\u2019t know some factoid. There is a fear that we will enter a conversation not being completely up-to-date, but what is the point of a conversation if all we are exchanging are the facts we already know?</p><p>Wisdom comes when we increase both our numerators and our denominators. We need to both know what we know and as much as possible about what we don\u2019t.</p><p>We have had an explosion of learning products published online, whether sites like Wikipedia that offer a huge library of content for consumption or MOOCs like Udacity and Coursera that have more interactivity built in. We can learn about almost any subject imaginable today, and of course, get the details and data that the internet always offers.</p><p>Yet, these companies have barely started to build platforms for purpose-driven learning. In fact, the rhetoric around online education has focused so much on skills, credentials, and mechanisms of accountability that we have mostly neglected building up the more fundamental skill of simply learning what information is invaluable, merely valuable, and useless in a field.</p><p>We need to develop thinkers, not information processors. That\u2019s incredibly hard in a world where students want instantly useful skills that are going to be worth a premium in industry. Just look at all of the coding education startups \u2013 there is far more coverage of CSS gradients than algorithms in many of these curriculums. Yet that deeper material is precisely what will differentiate students as thoughtful developers.</p><p>We do students a disservice when we only focus on that numerator of knowledge they know rather than that denominator of knowledge they are aware of exists. Yes, we want students to know how to process an HTML form, or to run a regression. But we also want them to become independent learners, adults who know when they need help, and how they might seek out the answers they are looking for.</p><p>Two weeks ago, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/17/why-is-the-university-still-here/\">I asked why the university is still here</a>. The answer really comes down to its ability to teach students both knowledge and wisdom. There is no reason this can\u2019t be done online or through books, but so far it hasn\u2019t. It remains one of the largest opportunities in the edtech learning space available to entrepreneurs today.</p><p>People can be incredibly smart, even brilliant sometimes, and yet still be bad at deep learning. The internet has given us this omniscience that we have never had before, and we suddenly have this ability to see all of the details that we don\u2019t know about. We need to inculcate the skills to navigate that world, handle ambiguity and ignorance, and become more purpose-driven learners.</p><p>*Note: May actually be me.</p>", "title": ["How Should We Learn?"], "author": ["Danny Crichton"]},

Right now, even a high-end car (not counting, say, Tesla\u2019s iPad-like multimedia and navigation display) might have a single megapixel on its\u00a0infotainment systems. Nvidia\u2019s new chip would be able to power far more than that \u2013 as many as four Full HD (2 megapixels) simultaneously or even two 4K screens if you really wanted an absurdly nice movie experience for the kids in the back seat.</p><p>Besides the screens, the platform can also power features like speech recognition and image recognition.</p><p>Nvidia showed off in its keynote today a number of rather playful examples for what your future car dashboard could look like. One example was dynamically rendered 3D interfaces for your speedometer and navigation, with the ability to shift between different \u201ctextures\u201d on-the-fly \u2014 one day you could have a Tron-like metal-and-neon look, and the next coat everything in bamboo. It\u2019s not exactly a major selling point for a high-end car, but this new platform will allow the likes of Ford and Chevy to bring more interesting and useful interfaces\u00a0to the car in the next few years.</p><p>Nvidia will make a reference platform of the Drive CX available to car manufacturers.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1100284\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_4877.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683\" alt=\"IMG_4877\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"></p><p>Besides the new dashboard experience, Nvidia also today talked about how its platforms can enable new driver assistance tools. Right now, we are seeing many cars that include radar, ultrasonic sensors and image-recognition technologies. As the company noted, however, radar and ultrasonic sensors are now slowly getting replaced by image-recognition technologies. What used to be only possible with radar can now be done with an array of cameras and computer vision technology.</p><p>To get to self-driving cars, cars will have to be able to build a model of the world around it. The car of the future, the company argues, will be a \u201csoftware-defined car.\u201d All of the cameras around the car will have to be connected to a single platform. To enable this, Nvidia today also announced the Drive PX, which will feature two X1 processors that can process camera inputs from up to 12 cameras.

In our view, this is almost like 19th century politicians trying to hold a Yes/No vote\u00a0on industrialization.</p><p>Our perspective is based\u00a0on\u00a0direct research into these work platforms over the last two years, which suggest a far more complex ecosystem. Here I share just a few of our recent findings:</p><p>These anecdotal examples are not intended to refute the sharpest critics of\u00a0work\u00a0platforms, for\u00a0we\u2019ve also found considerable evidence to validate many of their chief concerns. For instance, deep pay disparities between contractors\u00a0on\u00a0some\u00a0work\u00a0platforms\u00a0and average compensation rates which can fall below the minimum wage\u00a0on\u00a0others.</p><p>We\u00a0cannot be passive bystanders to the future of\u00a0work, hoping that current\u00a0work\u00a0platforms, as admirable as many of\u00a0them\u00a0are, can evolve into what\u00a0we\u00a0need\u00a0as a country: positive\u00a0platforms, which\u00a0we\u00a0define as\u00a0on-demand\u00a0work\u00a0systems that are intentionally designed to maximize the benefits for everyone connected to\u00a0them\u00a0\u2014 including, and especially, their workers.</p><p>Our simple rule of thumb is that the positive externalities of these\u00a0platforms\u00a0can be designed to outweigh their negative externalities.</p><p>Collaborating with industry and policy leaders,\u00a0we\u00a0are now striving to ask the right questions about this technology \u2014 and develop the answers most likely to promote positive\u00a0platforms.</p><p>We\u00a0see great promise in pricing models that don\u2019t commoditize individual tasks, but instead align the interests of the platform with its workers. For instance, a commissions-based model similar to how entertainment agencies operate, where an agency\u2019s revenue is a flat percentage of their client\u2019s earnings. Operating in this way, platform owners would be directly incentivized to <em>maximize</em>\u00a0their platform workers\u2019 revenue.</p><p>We\u00a0are already seeing\u00a0platforms\u00a0that strongly suggest the answer to this is Yes. For instance, as much of the U.S. education system remains in financial distress (both for students and colleges), the crowdsourced platform Duolingo applies a Mechanical Turk-type translation\u00a0work\u00a0model that enables teaching languages to its users for free, with incredibly impressive results. (According to the company, there are more people learning language\u00a0on\u00a0Duolingo\u2019s platform\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2015/01/08/duolingo-for-schools-may-change-the-edtech-market/\">than in the entire U.S. public school system</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, it is not difficult to imagine the immense matchmaking power of\u00a0on-demand\u00a0platforms\u00a0being used to address issues like underemployment and even overall GDP growth, by more dynamically matching people to\u00a0work\u00a0and training opportunities.</p><p>These are very tentative answers, and much more research is needed. It\u2019s our hope that industry and policy captains continue coming forward to\u00a0work\u00a0with us, sharing their data, wisdom and statecraft, so\u00a0we\u00a0can better cultivate this technology in a direction\u00a0we\u00a0all support.</p><p>Ultimately, our traditional corporate/organizational structures are themselves a technology \u2014 one that was mostly designed to coordinate mass industrial production. As digital\u00a0platforms\u00a0provide new ways of coordinating economic activity, they will upset many of our assumptions about how\u00a0work\u00a0and organizations \u201cshould\u201d behave.</p><p>Our task over the coming decades is to amplify their opportunities while mitigating their challenges. Only together can\u00a0we\u00a0design new structures all of us can live with \u2014 and work\u00a0in.</p>", "title": ["What We Need To Know About On-Demand Work Platforms Before Regulating Them"], "author": ["Devin Fidler"]},

To transition from a startup into a late-stage company that aims to be around for 100 years, <a href=\"http://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a> today confirms it\u2019s raised a <a href=\"http://blog.evernote.com/2012/05/03/evernote-raises-70-million-financing/\">$70 million Series D round</a> of funding at a $1 billion valuation. \u00a0Meritech Capital and CBC Capital were chosen to lead the round because they\u2019re the firms that can help Evernote prepare for an eventual IPO.</p><p>Evernote doesn\u2019t need the money. It still has much of the <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/evernote\">$96 million that it\u2019s raised to date</a> in the bank plus over one million paying customers out of its 25 million+ users. But now Evernote will have the cash to isolate itself from short-term market conditions. The Series D will also fund international expansion, including a push in China, strategic acquisitions, the development of business accounts and other features, and hiring of developers, designers, Q&amp;A, and support.</p><p>But just because it\u2019s maturing, Evernote has no plans of slowing down. I interviewed CEO Phil Libin about what the future holds for Evernote. He assured me \u201cThis funding keeps is us in the sweet spot to take risks. This is the most creative stage for the company.\u201d</p><p><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/evernote-apps.png?w=479&amp;h=312\" alt=\"\" title=\"Evernote Apps\" width=\"479\" height=\"312\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-545457\"></p><p>As information overload becomes more prevalent, Evernote\u2019s mission to let you remember everything becomes increasingly relevant. The company offers a suite of <a href=\"http://evernote.com/evernote/\">Evernote web and mobile apps</a> for saving files, images, web clips, and notes, and syncing them across devices. For a few dollars a month, user can upgrade to more storage space.\u00a0Evernote\u2019s\u00a0real value comes in combining them into an app that lets you intelligently access saved content, not just store it.</p><p>Evernote competes with Dropbox, Box, iCloud, and Google Drive in cloud storage, Instapaper and Spool in web clipping, and Photoshop and Gimp in image editing as Evernote acquired image annotator\u00a0<a href=\"http://evernote.com/skitch/\">Skitch</a>\u00a0last year. The wealth of established competitors indicate a challenge for Evernote, but also a clear need for its products. \u00a0Libin tells me he doesn\u2019t see competitors as Evernote\u2019s biggest threat, though. \u201cThe most likely way we\u2019ll fail is if we stop making good products. If we get defensive, we\u2019ll lose focus on quality.\u201d</p><p><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/size_590_phil_libin_evernote.jpeg?w=590&amp;h=443\" alt=\"\" title=\"Phil Libin, Evernote CEO\" width=\"590\" height=\"443\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-545293\"></p><p>Joining <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners\">Meritech Capital</a> and <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/cbc-capital\">CBC Capital</a> in the round and the company\u2019s 100 year vision are funds and accounts managed by <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/t-rowe-price-associates\">T.

Libin tells me \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about an IPO within a few years, and are\u00a0selecting investors and partners to help with that. They\u2019re the types of investors that are buying into public companies, and we want to have as many relationships with them as possible.\u201d</p><p>Regarding the impressive valuation as a private company, Libin excitedly admits that it\u2019s not about Evernote being worth $1 billion today, but\u00a0\u201cI agree with our very wise investors. I think that Evernote as a publicly traded company could be worth $10 billion, $100 billion or more.\u201d</p><p>It <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/evernote/posts\">certainly has momentum</a>. In the nine months since it raised $50 million in July, it\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/24/evernote-bought-four-companies-last-year-and-almost-nobody-knew-about-it/\">made four acquisitions</a>, opened offices around the world, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/31/crunchies-dropbox/\">won a Crunchie</a>, and grew to over 25 million users. Both registered and active user counts have tripled since July.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/03/evernote-70-million/evernote-1-million-paying-customers-done/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-545347\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/evernote-1-million-paying-customers-done.png?w=308&amp;h=336\" alt=\"\" title=\"Evernote 1 Million Paying Customers\" width=\"308\" height=\"336\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-545347\"></a>Update: Libin tells me \u201cConversion to premium goes up with the length of time someone\u2019s been using Evernote. In the first month only a very small percentage, less than 0.5% of people pay for premium, but it goes up every month after that. Our \u201coldest\u201d users, those that have been with us for about four years, are almost 25% paid premium.\u00a0Overall, we have more than a million premium users.\u201d</p><p>Bringing on CBC Capital, aka <a href=\"http://www.cbc-capital.com/en/forpublichome.html\">China Broadband Capital</a>, as an investor will surely assist with the imminent launch in China. When that happens, expect Evernote\u2019s user count to soar.</p><p>Now, Libin looks to make going public smooth and seamless. \u201cWe want as few things as possible to change at the IPO. I don\u2019t what it to be disruptive or a goal, but just a step along the way.\u00a0We\u2019re focusing 100% of our energy into making the product better. The most important thing is that you trust us, and use Evernote for the rest of your life. Because if you do, we can ge the revenue out you. We don\u2019t have to squeeze it out. That\u2019s why the unit economics work so well and the business model is so profitable and attractive\u201d</p><p>His voice filled with true passion for the company he\u2019s built, Libin concludes, \u201cEvernote is really about making you smarter. You use it, fall in love, and end up spending money.\u201d</p><p><em>[Image Credit: <a href=\"http://exame.abril.com.br/pme/noticias/10-startups-que-devem-bombar-em-2012?p=5\">Exame</a>]</em></p>", "title": ["Evernote Raises $70M At A $1B Valuation To Prep For An IPO, And The Next 100 Years"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},

The search giant was\u00a0advertising\u00a0a special offer, whereby T-Mobile customers could get the Nexus 4 for $199 on a 2-year contract, after a $50 mail-in rebate. That\u2019s still not nearly as good a deal as the $300 Google was charging off-contract, but people apparently didn\u2019t care that much,\u00a0because\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.androidauthority.com/nexus-4-is-out-stock-t-mobile-133377/\">T-Mobile is now sold out</a> only hours after Google started pointing shoppers in T-Mobile\u2019s direction.</p><p>The Nexus 4 seemed to be a hot seller initially, with Google selling out of the handset in markets around the world within hours or even minutes (a friend joked that I must have\u00a0been one of 15 who got in under the wire for Canadian pre-orders). The smartphone is Google\u2019s latest Android reference device, meaning it carries stock Android 4.2, and will always be first in line for future updates, regardless of carrier. The phone is made by OEM partner LG and <a title=\"High-End Specs + Low Price + No Wireless Contract = Success For The Nexus\u00a04\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/screw-wireless-contracts/\">shares many of its internal specs with the Optimus G,</a> save for the absence of LTE connectivity. Its shared internals with LG\u2019s own branded phone, which could very well bring in higher margins, might have something to do with its stock scarcity.</p><p>Google likely didn\u2019t anticipate the kind of demand that the Nexus 4 is seeing, hence the global stock shortage. In fact, one of its execs even said in a recent interview<a title=\"Google\u2019s Nexus Strategy In A Nutshell: Cheap Mobile Internet\u00a0Everywhere\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/05/googles-nexus-strategy-in-a-nutshell-cheap-mobile-internet-everywhere/\"> it doesn\u2019t expect Nexus devices to be top-selling Android handsets</a>.

In fact, many pointed fingers directly at the carriers as the cause of problems when Google\u2019s initial attempt to sell Nexus devices (specifically, the Nexus One) directly via its online store.</p><p>This time around, the price and other conditions appear to be right.

It\u2019s not that surprising that Microsoft would opt for something closer to home with its new mobile division, and it\u2019s gone with the straightforward route in picking a new name: Microsoft Mobile.</p><p>The memo is from Nokia to its business partners, advising them of the change. Back when the sale was first announced, then-Nokia CEO Stephen Elop admitted that the name would likely change, but also noted that there wasn\u2019t yet a definite replacement for what would come after.

Other investors include Google Ventures (Kevin Rose is Google\u2019s partner on the deal), Tim Ferriss, Jason Calacanis, and Gary Vaynerchuk.</p><p>Co-founders Gino Zahnd (CEO) and John Bragg (CTO) gave me a quick tour of the service on Wednesday. They say it tackles two of the big interactions between landlords and tenants \u2014 the rental application and the actual payment.</p><p>When it comes to applications, landlords really only care about a few things, Zahnd says, namely the applicant\u2019s job, employer, income, and the percentage of their income that they\u2019d be paying in rent. Everything else on the standard application is just noise. So instead of forcing renters to fill out a long \u00a0application that the landlord probably won\u2019t read, applicants create a shorter profile on Cozy. Landlords get an online dashboard where they can sort through the applications, while renters get a single profile that they can send to any interested landlord, rather than filling out the same application over and over.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/04/cozy-funding/cozy-screenshot/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-667029\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cozy-screenshot.jpg?w=640&amp;h=360\" alt=\"cozy screenshot\" title=\"cozy screenshot\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-667029\"></a></p><p>Once the landlord has actually selected a tenant or tenants, Cozy also manages the rent payment process. Zahnd notes that for many people, rent is the one check that they still write each month. Thanks to Cozy, it may finally be time to get rid of your checkbook. Both the landlord and renter enter their bank account information on the site, then the renter can visit Cozy whenever it\u2019s time to make a payment, or they can set up automatic monthly payments. And renters can divide the costs between multiple roommates \u2014 Cozy collects the money from each roommate, combining it into a single payment for the landlord.</p><p>It sounds like Cozy comes out of the frustrations Zahnd and Bragg have experienced as renters themselves, like the time a landlord ran a credit check on Zahnd six times in eight hours, lowering his credit score, or the months that Bragg struggled to find an apartment in San Francisco. (As a renter myself, I definitely see the appeal.) At the same time, the pair says it has spent a lot of time speaking to landlords to learn what their problems are and what they\u2019d want to see in this kind of product.</p><p>For now, Cozy is targeting landlords who own between 1 and 25 units. In other words, these aren\u2019t large property management companies, but rather individuals who have experienced plenty of frustrations of their own. Approaching the landlords is probably the right way to go, because they have more control in the relationship \u2014 a tenant probably isn\u2019t in a position to force a new payment system on their landlord. The challenge, Zahnd and Bragg admit, is trying to recruit customers when the landscape of small property owners is so fragmented. They say they\u2019ve come up with some strategies to deal with the problem, though they\u2019re not ready to talk about them yet.</p><p>Cozy is also expanding its invite-only beta today beyond the initial hand-picked landlords. Interested property owners can now sign up at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cozy.co\">the Cozy site</a>, and the company will gradually bring new users into the service.</p><p>The company emerged from i/o Ventures, the incubator and co-working space in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District (Cozy was <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/30/here-are-the-five-startups-in-io-ventures-latest-class/\">originally called Avenue</a>).

Well.</p><p>Nokia recently <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/14/nokia-says-its-disappointed-with-indian-court-ruling-that-rejected-asset-transfer-to-microsoft/\">lost a request for appeal in India</a>\u00a0over a dispute regarding taxes. This means\u00a0that the company has to either put up a huge\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/17/india_nokia_microsoft_plant_transfer/\">$572.5 million sum</a> against potential tax costs in the country, or a factory that is quite important to Nokia, and Microsoft, will remain a frozen asset. Presumably that would put the deal as originally created on hold, as one of the assets that Microsoft intends to buy is unavailable for purchase.</p><p>Nokia\u2019s response to the failure to get an appeal was sharp:</p><p>Nokia had previously agreed to put\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/17/india_nokia_microsoft_plant_transfer/\">$369 million</a> aside for potential tax penalties. The company also dislikes the government\u2019s plan for how it would tap the pool of cash it demands. To <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"b\">quote the India Times</a>:</p><p>So the sums here are huge and tangled. Why is the factory frozen? The Times is blunt:</p><p>This raises the following question: Can the deal be done without the factory? Nokia could operate it for Microsoft, but the company wants to see it sold; interim decisions could be used as stopgap measures. Nokia can well afford the tax bill, ironically, after the deal goes through. That it is selling an asset and keeping the legal exposure it generated is also darkly humorous.</p><p>The lack of guidance from the companies as to whether the timeframe for the deal has changed, how they intend to proceed, and what implications it will have on their operations and incomes is likely due to legal requirements and a rapidly shifting situation.

Today, the firm <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kpcb.com/insights/introducing-kpcb-productworks-because-we-need-more-edisons\">announced</a> that General Partner Bing Gordon, who was the former Chief Creative Officer at EA, will become the firm\u2019s chief product officer, leading <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kpcb.com/productworks\">KPCB ProductWorks,</a> a program that provides entrepreneurs the intensive mentoring, recruiting and technical assistance needed to create consumer, enterprise and digital health products and services.</p><p>At a discussion with reporters today, Gordon told us he will continue to make investments and take board seats on behalf of Kleiner Perkins, but since the much of his time will be spent with ProductWorks, he will be scaling back his board involvement compared to traditional VCs.</p><p>This follows KPCB\u2019s announcement last week that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/04/john-maeda-joins-kpcb/\">RISD President John Maeda is joining</a> the firm as Design Partner. Maeda will play an important role in ProductWorks by helping entrepreneurs build design DNA into their company cultures. Maeda, along with KPCB General Partner Mike Abbott, former VP of Engineering at Twitter; and Partner Megan Quinn, former head of product at Square, will all be working on ProductWorks with Gordon.</p><p>\u201cGreat products are at the core of great companies,\u201d said KPCB General Partner Ted Schlein in a release. \u201cEven the most brilliant founders need help refining, prioritizing and executing on their product vision. With ProductWorks, our goal is to deepen and extend our support to entrepreneurs who are building stellar products.\u201d</p><p>So what is ProductWorks? As Gordon, Abbott, Quinn and Maeda explained today, it is sort of like a university for Kleiner founders. The program includes mentorship from the above partners, but also one-on-one product review sessions with a KPCB partner during ProductWorks\u2019 monthly Office Hours at the KPCB San Francisco office. The firm says it will also hold a series of product workshops led by key industry product managers. ProductWorks will focus on giving founders access to top product, design and engineering leaders through events with KPCB\u2019s product, Engineering and Design Councils, and through various meetups and events.</p><p>As Gordon commented, it is institutionalizing much of what Kleiner already did with founders into a central place. And Abbott and Quinn explain that ProductWorks is also about how to scale knowledge, mentorship, and education to a wide group of people. Part of that will involve more writing by Kleiner partners and Maeda, and disseminating this information on their site.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-929663\" alt=\"ProductWorks_\u2014_Kleiner_Perkins_Caufield_Byers\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/productworks_e28094_kleiner_perkins_caufield_byers.png?w=639&amp;h=304\" width=\"639\" height=\"304\"></p><p>Another aspect of ProductWorks will be recruiting. Because of the talent challenges every founder faces, KPCB will be giving entrepreneurs access to a pool of young designers, engineers and product managers via the KPCB Design, Engineering and Product Fellows programs. For the past two years, Kleiner Perkins <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/03/kleiner-perkins-adds-year-long-product-manager-track-to-design-and-engineering-fellows-program/\">has operated</a> a summer fellowship program to place top engineering, product and design talent from colleges at the firm\u2019s portfolio companies.</p><p>ProductWorks sounds similar in theory to the design team at Google Ventures, but with additional product and engineering focus as well. Adding these valued-added services, especially with the advice of someone like Maeda or Gordon, can be meaningful for entrepreneurs. As for operationalizing ProductWorks, Gordon says they may hire a few people to support the initiative but it certainly wouldn\u2019t be an army of talent.</p><p>It\u2019s an interesting move for Kleiner that sheds some light on some of the questions we all had following the restructuring news. Many weren\u2019t sure about Gordon\u2019s fate, in particular, with the partner not being named as a managing director of the firm\u2019s early-stage fund. But it seems that with this announcement, Gordon is staying at Kleiner and will be making investments, just not as many. \u201cIn a time of change, we wanted to go back to our first principles,\u201d said Gordon. Part of that is helping entrepreneurs. Another part, he explains, is productizing VC, and Kleiner was among the first to hire outside talent to help with recruiting and marketing.</p><p>Can VCs productize product and design? Perhaps. Google Ventures has seen success with its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/23/inside-a-google-ventures-design-sprint/\">design sprints,</a> and in this VC climate, most firms are <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/20/meet-grove-sequoia-capitals-new-startup-events-and-how-to-content-hub/\">trying to find ways of sharing knowledge</a> across the portfolio.

Previously, a Glow user could invite their partner to connect, but that experience centered around providing support.\u00a0Male infertility accounts for 40% of cases, so it was a natural next step for the company, Glow VP of partnerships and\u00a0marketing\u00a0\u00a0Jennifer Tye said.</p><p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe\u2019re asking things that people don\u2019t talk about in polite conversation, but they\u2019re really important to tracking your fertility,\u201d\u00a0Jennifer Tye,\u00a0VP of Partnerships &amp; Marketing at Glow, said. \u201cSleep duration, fitness, proximity to heat, as you enter that in, the information gets logged and we will get an insight \u2014 probably telling you something that exposure to heat is not good for sperm quality.\u201d</p><p class=\"p1\">Since launch, the company has helped facilitate 50,000 pregnancies. Eight months ago, it had facilitated 25,000 pregnancies, Tye said. The app will ask various questions about diet and health, and taking all that into account with the rest of the data it has collected it will give suggestions on how to increase the chance of pregnancy.</p><p class=\"p1\">Tracking all that information\u00a0also has other\u00a0benefits \u2014 Glow is also able to tap its wealth of data about fertility and for research purposes. For example, last October the Glow team presented at a conference research that showed that women were more likely to start their cycle right after a new moon, and much less likely during a full moon. (That information is still anonymized, Tye said.)</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually something that\u2019s been studied and probably talked about in folklore, but our medical advisor said we should look into it,\u201d Tye said. \u201cWe looked at 38,000 cycles, and were able to see a really clear correlation.

The Glow fertility predicting app can be used worldwide.</p><p>The second is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.glowing.com/glow_first#mtop\">Glow First</a>, a unique \u201cfertility funding community\u201d for the U.S. market. This is an optional 10 month program into which users of the Glow app invest $50 per month.

Take Uber for example, their <span class=\"il\">app</span> isn\u2019t game-changing, but evolving <span class=\"il\">the</span> experience of taking a cab is powerful enough to disrupt an entire industry. And now wearables are doing <span class=\"il\">the</span> same thing.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Wearables are where <span class=\"il\">the</span> experience evolution kicks into high gear, but there\u2019s one more piece to <span class=\"il\">the</span> experience evolution that is perhaps even more important for developers and organizations to keep in mind: How you experience something depends on where you experience it. Have you ever tried to read an e-book on an iPad in <span class=\"il\">the</span> bright sun? If so, you know what I mean.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This notion of where you experience an <span class=\"il\">app</span> as a fundamental principle came crashing home for me a few years ago when I spent some time in Kenya working with a number of Salesforce Foundation customers who were looking to build mobile applications on <span class=\"il\">the</span> Salesforce1 Platform.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">My colleagues and I toured <span class=\"il\">the</span> Kibera slums where a customer was bringing clean toilets to <span class=\"il\">the</span> millions of inhabitants. Each toilet was managed by a franchise and run as a business. Part of that business was tracking usage to ensure adequate toilet distribution and waste removal schedules. <span class=\"il\">The</span> franchise tracked all of this using paper and pen.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I suggested it would be more efficient with a mobile <span class=\"il\">app</span>. <span class=\"il\">The</span> implementation partner quickly reminded me that we were in <span class=\"il\">the</span> middle of a slum in Kenya \u00adand you would get mugged for a mobile device faster than you could say \u201ciPhone.\u201d</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I remember nodding my head. I could write <span class=\"il\">the</span> best <span class=\"il\">app</span> in <span class=\"il\">the</span> world; it would have amazing user experience and save people countless hours shuffling paper around. But I forget where <span class=\"il\">the</span> user would experience <span class=\"il\">the</span> <span class=\"il\">app</span>. Failing to do so will doom any <span class=\"il\">app</span> to <span class=\"il\">the</span> digital wasteland.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Where you experience something is critical. It\u2019s a lesson I learned <span class=\"il\">the</span> hard way. But it is also <span class=\"il\">the</span> huge wearable opportunity: delivering new experiences at <span class=\"il\">the</span> right time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This notion is what keeps location-based <span class=\"il\">apps</span> around. It changes how we experience everyday activities. We no longer have to search for a restaurant on Yelp on our computer, we can find a recommendation for a good restaurant near our current location.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Remember when we used to have to print directions before leaving <span class=\"il\">the</span> house? Now we easily find our way around without planning ahead, or go out for a run and have our distance automatically tracked.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Even location-based dating <span class=\"il\">apps</span> have been able to keep up in <span class=\"il\">the</span> crowded market; for example, Happen let\u2019s us get a second chance with someone we pass on <span class=\"il\">the</span> street and otherwise might not have met. It all goes back to <span class=\"il\">the</span> right experience at <span class=\"il\">the</span> right time and place.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But it\u2019s not all fun and games. Take for example, <span class=\"il\">the</span> manufacturing, construction, medical and field services industries. They are all prime for <span class=\"il\">the</span> experience evolution. Being able to work hands-free in hazardous or sensitive areas with <span class=\"il\">the</span> ability to access information where and when it\u2019s needed will massively change how these industries operate.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For example, cloud ERP company, Plex, is using wearable technology such as Google Glass to connect everything from machines and sensors to PCs and mobile devices to employees on <span class=\"il\">the</span> manufacturing shop floor. In <span class=\"il\">the</span> construction industry, XoEye Technologies is using wearable technology to connect workers\u2019 glasses to their manager so they are able to see exactly what workers on site are seeing and help out remotely.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Medical students will no longer be required to lean forward to peer down on surgeons to learn their craft; they will have <span class=\"il\">the</span> ability to learn from more accessible locations.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"il\">The</span> opportunities for wearables are endless. <span class=\"il\">Apps</span> are now <span class=\"il\">the</span> status quo. <span class=\"il\">The</span> true opportunity is in <span class=\"il\">the</span> experience evolution: how these <span class=\"il\">apps</span> unlock entirely new ways of interacting with \u00adan augmented \u00adworld around us. \u201cWhere\u201d is <span class=\"il\">the</span> new killer feature.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">RIP, <span class=\"il\">App</span> <span class=\"il\">Revolution</span>.

See, before AT&amp;T pulled its application, the FCC had big plans to put the deal before an administrative law judge, effectively prolonging the process and magnifying the details of the merger. As part of those big plans, the FCC had compiled an 109-page report with their findings during the review process.

The One won\u2019t be available until October but I carried Zip around for a week or so already and found it to be quite fun and capable.</p><p>The Zip is a departure from the original \u201cclothespin\u201d style Ultra in that it can be removed from its case to create a sort of pedometer lozenge. It also runs on a single watch battery that lasts for six months, making it far more interesting to folks who don\u2019t want to lug their charger with them.</p><p>The Zip is similar to the first Fitbit in that it measures steps taken, calories, and distance. It does not support stairs taken, which could be a dealbreaker for fans of the current model. Most important, it does away with Fitbit\u2019s pretty growing flower iconography \u2013 a flower grew when you exercised more \u2013 and instead replaces it with a smiling face that beams at you when you\u2019ve gotten off your couch.</p><p>Instead of a cradle, Fitbit includes a small dongle for USB devices as well as low power Bluetooth support for syncing with mobile devices.</p><p>The other new Fitbit, the One, features everything the Ultra had, including the stair meter, as well as Bluetooth 4.0 support. The One also has a gradual alarm for waking yourself from sleep, something that was missing in the original models.<br>\n</p><p>Why a Fitbit? I\u2019ve found that the Fitbit really helps you understand your activity levels. While it\u2019s not a complete indicator of fitness, it\u2019s nice to know I\u2019ve been sitting down all day long and could probably use a walk. While I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a great weight loss tool, it\u2019s definitely an excellent reminder and prod for adding a bit more physical activity to your day.

This, paired with powerful software, allows Lytro users to pivot the shot around for a 3D effect, or even better, change the focus of the shot after the picture has been taken.</p><p>With the new Lytro Illum, all of these capabilities are still there, but with <em>more</em>. Though the Illum looks like your standard camera, it\u2019s built very differently. It has a brand new lens, with a zoom range of 30mm to 250mm with a super wide f/2.0 aperture across the entire thing. This is unheard of in standard cameras and lenses. And it\u2019s light too, weighing in at just 1.5 lbs.</p><p>What was originally being done by multiple pieces of glass can now be done through computation, which is how the Illum works.</p><p>The unibody magnesium chassis keeps the weight down, as does the lighter lens. The sleek design is unfamiliar in a world of buttoned-up cameras. Instead, the Lytro only has two physical buttons and two physical dials, everything else is touch-sensitive on the flip-out screen.

All of them have been working out of the i/o offices for the past three months, and have also received a $25,000 investment.</p><p>It\u2019s pretty hard to judge someone based on a short presentation, but if nothing else, all of the ideas sound pretty cool or at least interesting, and there\u2019s a nice mix of consumer and business products. Here\u2019s the list of companies:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.avenuehq.com\">Avenue</a> \u2014 A tool for managing the landlord-tenant relationship. It creates a single location online where landlords can review applications, run credit checks, and collect rent. At the same time, applicants have control over the process, so they\u2019re not sharing any information that they\u2019re not ready to share, and a landlord won\u2019t accidentally run a bunch of credit checks on them at once (apparently that happened to someone on the Avenue team). Co-founder Gino Zahnd previously led the UX teams at Kosmix, Flickr, and elsewhere. (The service is currently in private beta testing.)</p><p><a href=\"http://www.appthegame.co\">ApptheGame</a> \u2014 A personalized stream for sports fans, allowing them to check-in to live sporting events, whether they\u2019re at the stadium, the bar, or at home. The app then allows them to interact with other fans and also delivers customized content. Sports teams, in turn, can offer rewards for loyal fans \u2014 the company says two professional teams have already signed up.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.appsperse.com\">Appsperse</a> \u2014 Helps mobile app publishers calculate the return on investment of their user acquisition campaigns, broken down by different marketing channels. Co-founder Hugo Troche says this is something that\u2019s easily done on the Web, but it\u2019s a big challenge on mobile \u2014 and he cited his own experience as an app developer, as well as testimonials from others like Lumosity, to back up his case. \u201cIf Google has taught us anything, it\u2019s that if you provide advertisers with transparency and accountability the advertiser base grows,\u201d Troche says. (In private beta.)</p><p><a href=\"http://www.onefeat.com\">Onefeat</a> \u2014 An app that gamifies life. Users earn points by accomplishing different missions in the app, posting pictures, and getting positive votes from other users. You can tag other people in a photo to give them points too. In one mission, a Onefeat co-founder even got on his knees and proposed to Google\u2019s Marissa Mayer at a tech conference. (She said no.) Ultimately, co-founder Souheil Medaghri says he wants to create a new kind of star \u2014 \u201cthe heroes of everyday life\u201d who \u201cshine through awesomeness\u201d.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.vid.io\">vid.io</a> \u2014 Co-founder Rob Sandie was previously CEO of Viddler, which helps publishers distribute their own video content outside of YouTube. Viddler is a profitable, multi-million dollar business, he says, but ultimately fighting against YouTube is a \u201closing proposition\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s just going to keep growing. So Sandie and his team have created a \u201cHootSuite for YouTube,\u201d allowing companies to manage their presence on the video supersite.

Emotional words: beautiful, stunning, and love, were peppered throughout. In short, everything you would expect from an Apple keynote.</p><p>But there was also an undertone of language and phrases that will be important to enterprise developers. Apple\u2019s announcements point towards an increasing reliance on data and machine learning to deliver contextual apps that offer productivity gains through proactivity.</p><p>For the enterprise, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.developer.com/ws/context-the-secret-ingredient-of-killer-mobile-apps.html\">context is nothing new</a>. Terms such as 360 degree view of the customer have been a mainstay for management consulting for years. Where things get interesting for enterprises with iOS9 is in the broader availability of\u00a0organic context and app intelligence. Siri now recognizes abstract phrases like \u201c<i>remind me about this</i>,\u201d or \u201c<i>remind me when I get home</i>,\u201d and nearby searches show Apple Pay supported vendors. Tim Cook repeatedly emphasized enterprise foundations: privacy, security, and trust.</p><p>This rise of app intelligence will continue to ensure Apple invests heavily in the enterprise. iOS8 was a huge release for the enterprise that appears to have paid off. According to Apple, 98% of Fortune 500 companies have an iOS app.</p><p>At first look, iOS9 appears to be taking more of a foundational approach with a focus on better battery life, two-factor authentication for iCloud, and optimized OTA installs, Apple hopes to encourage as many iOS devices to run the latest version (83% of users are already on the latest version of iOS8, compared to only 12% for Android). App developers benefit from a less fragmented environment to allow them to create more contextual apps that deliver on Apple\u2019s vision. Enterprise IT departments benefit through streamlined device management and BYOD strategies.</p><p>So where does all of this leave enterprise app developers? The answer came with a statement from Tim Cook when he referred to Swift as the <i>\u201cthe next big programming language</i>,\u201d developers will be building apps in <i>\u201cthe next 20 years.\u201d</i> That\u2019s a big statement. It sounds a lot like Sun\u2019s battle cry for Java. Unlike Java, however, Tim Cook followed that statement up with two of the most important words any developer can ever hear: \u201copen source.\u201d</p><p>Thanks in large part to the ease of learning Swift \u2013 as compared to Objective-C -, the open sourcing of core libraries, and the ability for developers to create contextual apps on the latest versions of iOS, the opportunity to create apps, which can utilize the proactive features presented during the keynote, to drive employee productivity increases enterprises will likely accelerate, and expand, their native iOS development plans in the year to come.<img class=\"CToWUd\" src=\"https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/IUqyipEfku9mtuttHNH2aghGddOdP7pSlPSVRDpX94h7ocM812RswfxEZeTJorbrdTjaM4siiciwYWD44MeFePHSTOLbb4php5zm3v7TqAeObEM1idwWliKW25CveItYeWwqSsigBh1D--xWwVTTw6XZbRn6THy2tiF2YXMu8Q-7vizA60kcRvBlJ_5S3FBK8cn7Tf-1oZtzkJRv9DgZhxGxbeb7sYva3nENt6JNlRC3L73ud_ysKBlQVZ4MoGAfk-a458CikjVBDQRkAFNzDHZ1fg=s0-d-e1-ft#https://app.relateiq.com/t.png?c=chrome_gmail&amp;t=AFwhZf3DuQPkfJTlIV5LV9rUwQzkqCvEN57_ljBuBTdF45Rxk353ZeNWfomXZcP5T6jeQDukAyAyy0gn2PNzS9C4g471YITvX4zUSQRbtxoUPijWTQdEguTkhPiDFu9ZaNQBG_NkCD4D\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"></p>", "title": ["The Future Of Enterprise App Development Is Swift"], "author": ["Quinton Wall"]},

Local companies offer incentives that range from a 30 percent increase to doubling a candidate\u2019s current salary.</p><p>Beyond the standard prerequisites of technical and managerial skills, an attractive candidate for a Chinese technology company must have a strong understanding of diversity.

To remain competitive, a candidate must possess skills and experience developed from both structures.</p><p>In a fast-paced market such as China\u2019s technology sector, experienced talent is in high demand and generously compensated. Despite recent economic instability, the overall need for exceptional and competitive talent in China\u2019s technology market remains strong.</p><p>Working with a search consultant can guide candidates through the rapidly changing talent market in China, and can help assess new opportunities.</p>", "title": ["China Draws Executives From Silicon Valley"], "author": ["Norman Chang"]},

It\u2019s not that surprising, considering how the negotiations had gone at the end of last week. Cornell\u2019s top contender, Stanford University, <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/stanford-drops-bid-to-build-high-tech-campus-in-city/\">dropped out</a> on Friday \u2014 then Cornell followed up an hour later by announcing that it had already raised $350 million for the project.</p><p>[Update: \u201cThe city is also still negotiating with NYU, Columbia and Carnegie Mellon, to help them realize their proposals in some way,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.betabeat.com/2011/12/19/early-decision-mayor-awards-tech-campus-grant-to-cornell-and-technion-liveblog/\">BetaBeat</a> reports live from the press conference today.]</p><p>The goal of the campus is to further develop New York City as a key destination for technical talent, in the hopes of building a university-oriented innovation ecosystem along the lines of what Stanford and Berkeley have in Silicon Valley, and what MIT has in Cambridge. Cornell, an Ivy League school located far out in Ithaca, New York (state), already has a large medical center near the island in Upper East Side of Manhattan. And the city is full of Cornell alumni who want to see their alma mater become a more vital part of the emerging local tech scene.</p><p>Check out images of the new campus <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/19/siliconisland/\">here</a>.</p><p>And really, looking back, you have to wonder how serious Stanford had been lately. The timing of the Stanford pull-out and the Cornell donation was a little too good. Based on a couple recent conversations with some well-connected Stanford alums, my understanding is that it had already become clear that Stanford and the city were not going to work things out, so the city had Stanford go ahead and say it was out as a more gracious alternative to simply losing the bid. Another wrinkle here is that Cornell is being named this quickly. City officials had previously said not to expect a decision until next month.</p><p>Stanford had been frustrated by, among other issues, the back-and-forth negotiating that the city did once the university had submitted its bid in October, according to an earlier report by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/education/stanford-exits-contest-for-new-york-science-school-leaving-cornell-as-front-runner.html\">The New York Times</a>. That sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen so much in Palo Alto. Stanford had also not shown the same sort of financial or emotional support. I\u2019ve also heard that some at Stanford preferred a serious campus investment to happen elsewhere, such as China (I\u2019m seeing what else I can dig up about that).</p><p>The new campus, a partnership with\u00a0Israel\u2019s Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, will cost more than $2 billion, and will be comprised of\u00a02.1 million square feet dedicated to classrooms, labs, conference centers, housing and more for 2,000 graduate students.

{"date": ["2011-09-01"], "text": "<p>It\u2019s no surprise whatsoever that Sprint isn\u2019t down with the AT&amp;T/T-Mobile merger, and with good reason. There\u2019s no telling just how severe the effects of this deal may be on Sprint, but we know for sure that it won\u2019t be good. So with no other option, the carrier has campaigned against the merger since day one. We\u2019ve seen statement after statement, release after release\u2026 but this time Sprint is taking a new approach. Today Sprint threw their weight behind a study which debunks claims made by AT&amp;T and the Economic Policy Institute that this merger will create \u201ctens of thousands of jobs,\u201d and even goes so far as to say the deal will result in a reduction of American jobs. </p><p><a href=\"http://newsroom.sprint.com/images/9004/ATT-T-Mobile-merger-jobs-study.pdf\">The study</a> was commissioned by Sprint (surprise!) and conducted by David Neumark, professor of Economics and director of the Center for Economics and Public Policy at the University of California at Irvine. It focuses mainly on the EPI\u2019s analysis of the merger and their conclusion: that the increased capital investment made by AT&amp;T will, in turn, increase American jobs. Neumark\u2019s issue with this is that the EPI\u2019s conclusion rests solely on increased capital investment, rather than the overall effects of the merger. </p><p>AT&amp;T recently <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/31/att-t-mobile-jobs-us_n_943118.html\">promised to bring back 5,000 call center jobs</a> that had previously been outsourced abroad. The company also said the merger will result in no call center job losses, though in the official documents AT&amp;T admits that some \u201cforce reductions\u201d would occur. </p><p>Neumark also notes that AT&amp;T\u2019s logic behind the job creation claims is based on one figure: $8 billion in increased capital expenditures. The only problem there is that the figure is unclear. AT&amp;T may very well pump an extra $8 billion into its business, which <em>would</em> increase jobs, but that\u2019s only if the investment in capital expenditures T-Mobile would have undertaken are less than $8 billion. </p><p>The study concludes that if AT&amp;T/T-Mobile\u2019s <em>net</em> capital investment is reduced by $5 billion, that would result in 34,000 to 60,000 jobs lost. </p><p>Neumark also cites AT&amp;T\u2019s history with mergers, and the way those have affected job creation/loss in the past. \u201cSince 2002, AT&amp;T has eliminated over 107,000 jobs relative to the growth in employment that would have occurred from the acquisitions that occurred during that time period. This evidence is consistent with AT&amp;T\u2019s past mergers generating job loss,\u201d he writes. </p><p>Here\u2019s what AT&amp;T has to say about the study:</p><p>Obviously, there\u2019s much more than job creation to consider when it comes to this deal. Anti-trust issues and the potential stifling of innovation carry just as much weight. The possibility that AT&amp;T\u2019s network will be significantly improved will also play a major role in the decision.</p><p>But in the end, the statements made by both sides must be digested with a hefty helping of salt. AT&amp;T stands to gain quite a bit if it wins T-Mobile, and its statements on the matter will be framed accordingly. In the same vein, Sprint stands to lose and the claims made within its commissioned study require an equal amount of scrutiny. </p><p>It all comes down to the DOJ and the FCC, and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/31/reports-us-justice-department-looks-to-block-atts-acquisition-of-t-mobile/\">as it stands now</a>, AT&amp;T still has a long battle ahead of them. </p>", "title": ["Sprint: AT&T/T-Mobile Merger Would Destroy Jobs, Here\u2019s A Study To Prove It "], "author": ["Jordan Crook"]},

AT&amp;T will pay roughly $39 billion to Deutsche Telekom for T-Mobile USA. Deutsche Telekom will also get a roughly 8 percent ownership stake in AT&amp;T as a result of the deal. And a Deutsche Telekom executive will join AT&amp;T\u2019s Board.</p><p>With the deal, AT&amp;T will get access to T-Mobile\u2019s roughly 35 million customers. If the two fully merge, this will push AT&amp;T far past Verizon in terms of subscriber numbers. Currently, Verizon has about 100 million subscribers in the U.S., while AT&amp;T has about 95 million. This deal will also leave Sprint as the lone large outsider, with about 50 million subscribers.</p><p>The agreement has already been approved by both Boards, but obviously will have to pass government scrutiny.</p><p>Here are AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson\u2019s key quotes from the release:</p><p>And:</p><p>And here\u2019s Deutsche Telekom CEO Ren\u00e9 Obermann:</p><p>Stephenson\u2019s wording, and other wording in the release referencing President Obama seems to be a clear message that AT&amp;T thinks this deal should get government approval.

AT&amp;T wants to make it clear that they\u2019re doing this for the little guys. It\u2019s a smart play, but whether or not it will work is another matter. Certainly, Verizon will have some things to say about this deal.</p><p>It also looks like T-Mobile customers may end up getting access to the iPhone after all\u2026 <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/03/t-mobile-iphone-commercial/\">This commercial</a> is certainly much more interesting now.</p><p><strong>More</strong>:\u00a0<a title=\"Fast Break: As Of Last Week, Many At Sprint Thought They Were Merging With\u00a0T-Mobile\" rel=\"bookmark\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/20/sprint-t-mobile-att-deal/\">Fast Break: As Of Last Week, Many At Sprint Thought They Were Merging With\u00a0T-Mobile</a></p>", "title": ["In The Race For More Spectrum, AT&T Is Acquiring T-Mobile For $39 Billion"], "author": ["MG Siegler"]},

Essentially, it\u2019s a pay-as-you go travel concierge, so you bring your proposed trip to mygola, with specific targeted questions in mind, and the service handles all the logistics (research and bookings) for you.</p><p>Mygola is going for the 90 percent tech, 10 percent human curation approach, as the startup is in the process of bringing on thousands of travel enthusiasts to make them travel researchers. The startup combines human curation and customer service with a technology platform that aggregates the \u201centire travel web\u201d, auto-categorizing that wealth of information into deals, events, hotels, sublets, and tips from locals through Foursquare and other social platforms.</p><p>The paid \u201cmygola Guides\u201d currently numbers in the hundreds, according to Founder and ex-Googler Anshuman Bapna, who are distributed globally and are increasing at a rate of 80 a week. These guides are there help users plan their trips based on the crowdsourced data aggregated from travel sites all over the Web.</p><p>The service allows users to ask their first question for free, and if you like the answer that mygola gives you, users can tip accordingly. Users will then pay $30 to ask additional questions or have their entire trip planned for them, or they can pay $100 for a year long subscription.</p><p>Interested in trying out the service? Mygola is providing the first 100 TechCrunch readers with a 50 percent discount for the $30 and $100 plans, using the code \u201cTCLOVE\u201d. </p><p>Bapna and team have been referring to their model as the \u201cRobocop for travel\u201d, which gives you a sense of the somewhat quirky approach they\u2019re taking. Relying on real human beings to help you plan your trip, leveraging the best of travel information on the Web, is certainly a refreshing alternative to the many user-generated and crowdsourced travel sites out there, but the startup has an enormous amount of competition, and has a long way to go before it can convince users that paying $30 for their recommendations and bookings is easier and more valuable than doing it themselves.</p><p>The startup plans to use its new capital to continue hiring its \u201cmygola Guides\u201d and build out its current product.

It also could alert a woman when something isn\u2019t quite right and urge her to get it checked out.</p><p>Glow Nurture\u00a0is available for free in the App Store starting today.

To move forward, the startup has just taken $6 million in Series A financing from Andreessen Horowitz, and will be adding former Microsoft exec and recent a16z addition Steven Sinofsky to its board.</p><p>Local Motion, in short, wants to bring the same sort of efficiencies that the sharing economy promises to consumers \u2014 the ability to curtail ownership in certain goods and help manage usage to make them more readily available when needed \u2014 and apply those principles to enterprise and government entities.</p><p>With that in mind, the company has built a combination of hardware and software that will let users gain access to cars in a fleet, while also providing management tools for companies and government agencies to make sharing those cars more efficient. On the hardware side, Local Motion has a small box that connects to a car\u2019s on-board computer to allow users to unlock doors, while providing valuable usage information that feeds back into a SaaS-based dashboard for managing a fleet.</p><p>Employees, meanwhile, get instant access to vehicles, without having to worry about having a particular set of keys \u2014 they simply grab the nearest available car. And how do they know whether it\u2019s available or not? Well, the system can automate bookings and even has a mobile app for finding unused vehicles in the fleet.</p><p>With the improved access to vehicles comes the ability for employees to better share the available cars. No longer is a single car assigned to an individual or a group that only uses it about 20 percent of the time. Instead, the shared pool of cars means drastically more efficient usage across the entire organization. Local Motion estimates that its customers reduce usage by 30 percent within their fleets.</p><p>As time goes on, that means that fleets can be downsized so the company is only keeping the number of cars necessary. It also ensures that the cars can be kept on a regular maintenance schedule, and can give data about the energy consumption or speed patterns of various drivers.</p><p>And there\u2019s a big opportunity out there: There are about 10 million fleet vehicles on the road today, and they represent between 5 percent and 20 percent of all auto sales, but the companies and organizations that buy them generally don\u2019t have the tools to know how they\u2019re being used. Local Motion estimates that in many cases, only 40 percent of the cars in a fleet are being used, while another 20 percent are broken without a fleet operator realizing it.</p><p>Already Local Motion has been chosen by a couple of big clients to help them manage their fleets of vehicles. That includes Google and the City of Sacramento, as well as Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh\u2019s Downtown Project, which plans to use the technology to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/02/downtown-project-buys-100-tesla-model-ss-to-launch-project-100-a-car-sharing-service-in-las-vegas/\">manage its fleet of Teslas</a>. But it plans to aggressively expand to capture more of the enterprise and government markets for fleet management.</p><p>Founded by John Stanfield, who had been working on an electric car for urban areas that could shared among multiple people, as well as Clement Gires, who worked on Paris\u2019 Velib bicycle-sharing program, the startup is well positioned to bring sharing to the enterprise.</p><p>The funding from Andreessen Horowitz should help, as should the advice of new board member Sinofsky, who is no stranger to managing or working with large, complex organizations. Local Motion had previously raised seed funding from investors that include Lemnos Labs, Draper &amp; Associates, Morado Venture Partners, VegasTechFund, and AME Cloud Ventures.</p>", "title": ["Fleet Management Startup Local Motion Raises $6 Million From Andreessen Horowitz, Adds Steven Sinofsky To Its Board"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

The financing comes from Cerberus Business Finance and Goldman Sachs BDC, and includes follow-on investment from equity investor General Catalyst.</p><p>Highwinds is what you might consider an old school CDN: The company has been around since 2002 and specializes in traditional, commodity large and small file delivery. While most of its competitors have moved to offering higher margin services like dynamic site acceleration and advanced security services, Highwinds has continued to focus on providing very low-cost delivery of file downloads and video streams.</p><p>It\u2019s not sexy, but it works. And it has Highwinds generating enough free cash flow to be able to raise debt financing, according to CEO Steve Miller. The decision to raise debt, rather than equity financing, was made primarily so that he and others at the company could maintain control and keep as much of the company as possible.</p><p>\u201cWhen you think about the most expensive type of capital to raise, it\u2019s equity,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to end up like some of our competitors, who are having to raise equity financing so they could keep growing. We want to hold onto as much equity as we can.\u201d</p><p>Along with the financing, the company has completed a recapitalization that was aimed at redeeming some earlier equity investors. That primarily meant buying a equity stake from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/alta-communications\">Alta Communications</a>, which was looking to wind down the fund that Highwinds had been a part of. General Catalyst, also an equity investor, has maintained a stake in the company.</p><p>With the latest financing, Highwinds has raised a total of about $420 million in debt and equity financing since being founded. The funding ends up being the largest single amount raised by a content delivery network since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/06/07/limelightnetworks-ipo-idUSWEN866520070607\">Limelight Networks went public in 2007</a>.</p><p>So what\u2019s Highwinds plan to do with all the cash? According to Miller, the company will be using the working capital to re-invest in its global content delivery network while also looking at some M&amp;A opportunities. </p><p>It\u2019s hoping to expand the capacity of the network. And while it\u2019s focused primarily on commodity large- and small-file delivery for companies in the gaming, advertising, and media space, it could look to add more features \u2014 like say, dynamic site acceleration. </p><p>On the acquisitions side, Miller says the company will be looking to opportunities that would be complementary to its HTTP delivery business. That could help Highwinds move up the proverbial stack to provide higher-value services to its existing clients, while also helping to attract new ones.</p>", "title": ["Content Delivery Network Highwinds Raises $205 Million In Debt From Cerberus, Goldman Sachs, And General Catalyst"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

The startup, which makes cloud-based software to help restaurants manage almost all aspects of their business, is targeting growth in India, Manila, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Dubai.</p><p>Combined with its Series A, Mobikon\u2019s latest round brings its total raised so far to $5 million. Co-founder and chief executive officer Samir Khadepaun says the company will use its new capital to improve its technology and launch its new automated marketing software in August. Mobikon\u2019s platform, which is used by chains including Swensen\u2019s, Pizza Express in India, and Red Crab Group, currently handles 65,000 reviews and more than 600,000\u00a0diners every month.</p><p>Founded in 2009, Mobikon did not intend to target the food and beverage industry, says Khadepaun. The company\u2019s intention was tobuild a customer feedback platform for retail businesses that would be completely accessible on mobile devices.</p><p>When Mobikon first launched, however, it saw a lot of queries from restaurants. Many had no way to record and analyze reviews and customer opinions, so Mobikon decided to focus on creating a cloud-based feedback platform for them.</p><p>As the company began working with restaurants, it realized that many juggle multiple platforms to manage different aspects of their business. Instead of competing directly with other software providers, Mobikon decided to create a product that integrates most major systems into one dashboard.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of players built to solve different problems, but what is happening is that restaurants are being bombarded with different players trying to sell them multiple platforms, so some restaurants have seven to eight dashboards for reservations, ordering, and accounting systems,\u201d says Khadepaun.</p><p>Mobikon\u2019s new automated marketing software, which was tested in over 100 venues during its pilot program, is designed to make it easy for restaurants to run targeted campaigns. For example, businesses can set it so customers who give good feedback receive an invitation to a referral program. It can also notify managers when a VIP customer makes a reservation, so they can give them perks like a complementary bottle of wine.</p><p>Cities in India, Manila, and Kuala Lumpur are Mobikon\u2019s biggest growth markets, because more restaurants are springing up as the economy develops. Since they are new and don\u2019t have legacy systems, many are open to managing their business with tech tools as soon as they open.</p>", "title": ["Mobikon Raises $2.3M To Dish Up Marketing Software For Restaurants In Asia"], "author": ["Catherine Shu"]},

So, how are you going to wrap your head around all this location data? <a href=\"http://simplegeo.com\">SimpleGeo</a> has an awesome way.</p><p><a href=\"http://vicarious.ly\">Vicarious.ly</a> is a real-time location-based stream of information presented in a nice visual way. While the plan is to eventually launch one for many different cities around the U.S. and eventually the world, the first one is based around Austin, for SXSW. To make it, SimpleGeo partnered with BlockChalk, Brightkite, Bump Technologies, Flickr, Fwix, Foursquare, Gowalla, and Twitter to pull all of their location data and place it both in a constantly-updating stream, and put data points on a Google Map at the top of the page. These data points are represented by the logos of the various companies, so it\u2019s easy to follow visually.</p><p>Those concerned about the privacy implications of this need not worry, Vicarious.ly doesn\u2019t pull actual user names from the companies mentioned above. Instead, they simply note that \u201csomeone\u201d checked-in at a venue. They do, however, give the venue name, which is a hyperlink. So if someone just checked into Stubb\u2019s Bar-B-Q in Austin on Gowalla, you\u2019ll see a link back to the Gowalla page for that venue. Likewise, if someone uploads a geotagged picture to Flickr, you\u2019ll see a thumbnail of the picture in Vicarious.ly\u2019s stream, and clicking on it will take you to that picture\u2019s Flickr page.</p><p>It\u2019s fairly amazing to see just how much activity there is even today, the day before the conference starts. Tomorrow and the weekend should be insane. \u201c<em>The amount of real-time, location-based information we\u2019re indexing is staggering. \u00a0We wanted a powerful way to showcase that, so we built Vicarious.ly and targeted the launch to coincide with a massive gathering of geeks</em>,\u201d co-founder\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-galligan\">Matt Galligan</a> says about the project.</p><p>You\u2019ll note just how much of the activity are check-ins from either Foursquare or Gowalla.

The plan is to foster a strong technology ecosystem by bringing in lots of talented technical people and have them focus on building innovative businesses on top of the traditional industries in the city.</p><p>So I got on the phone with Daniel Huttenlocher after the press conference in New York earlier today, to get some more details about what his university is aiming to accomplish.</p><p>As the <a href=\"http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/June09/huttenlocherCIS.html\">dean</a> of the Faculty of Computing and Information Science (CIS), and a distinguished computer science professor at the University, he\u2019s been in the middle of the effort to get the new campus. In the extensive interview below, he provides more details on the types of students that the school will be looking for, and how he sees it adding to the development of a strong technology ecosystem in the city. As he explains, no one fully understands what makes an ecosystem form, but good technical schools are clearly a component \u2014 that New York could use more of.</p><p>Huttenlocher has the right background for the job ahead. His research spans computer vision, autonomous vehicles, social networking communication, and software development management. He has 22 patents and more than 50 published papers. He\u2019s also been involved with a few tech companies throughout his career. You can find out more about him <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~dph/\">here</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/6539358909_09286fe8a1_z.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-471624\" title=\"6539358909_09286fe8a1_z\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/6539358909_09286fe8a1_z.jpg?w=640&amp;h=417\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"417\"></a></p><p>Officially called the NYCTech Campus, the facilities will be a joint effort with Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. The plan is to begin moving in by 2017, and finish constructing 1.3 million of the 2 million square foot facility by 2027. In 20 years or so, the campus is expected to have 2,500 students and 280 professors.</p><p>The expectations are high, and reflect the city\u2019s efforts to iterate beyond its traditional industries like finance and advertising. A new study by New York City projects that the campus will generate above $23 billion in economic activity, along with $1.4 billion in tax revenue over the coming 30 years. In terms of job creation, construction will account for 20,000 near-term jobs, and the campus will provide 8,000 permanent ones. The study also estimates that some 600 companies will be spun out, that create another 30,000 jobs. To boost all of this, the campus will also introduce a $150 million fund for New York City startups.

But there\u2019s definitely a lot here.</p><p>Our approach is to take what we think is unique and look at what kind of role we can play. In terms of the unique parts of the ecosystem, the tech world is undergoing major shifts. Historically, the new technologies that have driven things have been pure tech plays. Increasingly, the value of tech is not coming as much from the pure tech side, and much more from people who deeply understand who to take it and transform something.</p><p>Amazon is my favorite example. It\u2019s a tech company and a retailer, and you can\u2019t separate the two.</p><p>In New York City, that\u2019s really the huge advantage \u2014 the presence of all these other industries.</p><p><strong>TechCrunch: Can you tell me more specifically how Cornell\u2019s academic programs are going to be playing a part in all this?</strong></p><p>Daniel Huttenlocher: Academically, we\u2019re looking at shifting away from traditional university campus disciplines. There\u2019ll be key disciplines involved \u2014 computer science, electrical engineering, operations research, applied math \u2014 but those disciplines need to be in the context of other disciplines where tech is being applied\u2026. hubs that combine tech and other fields. In media, for instance, there are relevant areas of the social sciences, like sociology and psychology.</p><p>It\u2019s about building interdisciplinary groupings that focus on these domains \u2014 Connective Media, Healthier Life, and the Built Environment. That second one isn\u2019t just health care, but things like lifestyle types of apps. The third is about smart building technology, green buildings.</p><p>If you look at startup companies in New York, there\u2019s certainly media. That\u2019s a big, active area in the city\u2019s economy.</p><p>For health, you\u2019re seeing some startups there. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s the leading edge of the startup world. Then with green tech, that\u2019s the bleeding edge, and there are relatively few companies. There\u2019s a lot of growth potential in all these areas from a jobs perspective, and we see the academic areas that support them are not pure tech.</p><p>The degrees offered \u2014 masters and PhDs \u2014 will require students to apply to the New York campus, based mainly on their interests in terms of faculty and programs. They\u2019ll have significant entrepreneurship and business requirements. Students need to be interested in that. For those who want pure tech, there\u2019s Ithaca [Cornell\u2019s home campus].</p><p>The faculty is also going to be a mix of those only in the city and some who are spending time on each campus. I\u2019m personally spending a lot of time in the city and may end up there.</p><p>One of the defining features is that students will have mentors. There are 50,000 alumni in the New York, with a significant portion in businesses where tech is playing an increasingly important role. Each students will have a local mentor working in business just like a student on a campus has a faculty advisers. We want students to come up with new ways of thinking based on things they\u2019ve learned very recently, that have commercial potential.</p><p><strong>TechCrunch: What have you learned from already having the medical college in New York?</strong></p><p>Daniel Huttenlocher: It really helped give us confidence in the practicality of all of this. The number of faculty who own joint appointments in both places, that have labs in both places \u2014 we realized we could do the same for technical fields.</p><p>We\u2019re also operating other large academic institutions in New York City, and we\u2019re experienced with other aspects \u2014 constructing buildings, fundraising, etc.</p><p>When talking to the mayor [Michael Bloomberg], one of the big components is that we\u2019d have an academic vision tailored to the city. Our alumni are also unbelievably supportive of it. [Deputy Mayor for Economic Development Robert K. Steel] has joked that out of our 50,000 local alumni, most have called him already to encourage the deal.</p><p><strong>TechCrunch: Do you know why Stanford pulled out?</strong></p><p>Daniel Huttenlocher: While this all turned in to a competition \u2014 at least to some people \u2014 every school that\u2019s participated is great. It\u2019s about finding the right match, not about which is better. I have a lot of really good friends at Stanford. And they may also end up here some day.</p><p><strong>TechCrunch: How are you going to define success in terms of the New York innovation ecosystem? It\u2019s not always obvious how academic work translates to new companies. And looking at Silicon Valley, it wasn\u2019t just Stanford that made the place what it is \u2014 there were people experimenting with radio in the 20s, and the semiconductor industry in the 50s.</strong></p><p>Daniel Huttenlocher: I know quite a bit about that. I worked at Xerox PARC in the late 80s and early 90s. What\u2019s interesting about tech in Silicon Valley is that a lot of innovation comes outside of some corporate entities. Xerox, Fairchild Semiconductor and Paypal have all been incredible cauldrons of innovation, with literally dozens of companies spinning out of each.</p><p>What causes those things to happen? I don\u2019t think anybody understands yet. Some of it comes from having the right universities around. Some of it comes from companies. The whole ecosystem creation process is, frankly, very poorly understood. What we think is clearly absent in New York City right now is enough of the right kind of engineering talent.</p><p>Everyone has a hard time hiring good software engineers \u2014 in the valley and everywhere else. New York has that problem much more than elsewhere in the country, it really needs that kind of tech talent. That\u2019s what we view we\u2019ll bring to the table very quickly.</p><p>Develpoing a vibrant ecosystem comes from having multiple companies at multiple stages of development, and will come from places you don\u2019t expect.</p><p>[At this point in the phone interview, Huttenlocher is interrupted by his partners at Technion leaving the room, and I overhear them say an appropriate departing line: \u201cnow we start the real work.\u201d]</p><p><strong>TechCrunch: So tell me about classes starting next September. That seems like an aggressive schedule.</strong></p><p>Daniel Huttenlocher:The plan is to start operating more or less immiediately. We\u2019re starting to look for new [temporary] space, with some leased already, and some possibilities for others. Cornell has a lot of operations in the city already, including the medical college and architecture school. It\u2019ll probably involve leasing additional space. We need to start attracting the good engineering talent, and we need a neutral meeting ground for all of the companies.</p><p>That\u2019s an important role that Stanford plays in the Valley. It helps people come together outside of the domain of one corporate entity or venture firm. We want to play that role quickly. We\u2019ll start having students down here as soon as we find space, and certainly by the fall.</p><p>Some of that will depend on admissions and other things that take time. Some students will already be at Cornell, who it\u2019d make sense to bring down and start working with companies.</p><p>Although, a lot of the young startups in the city already have Cornell engaged with them. I\u2019ve personally had meetings with more than 200 people in the local tech industry in the last few months. So it\u2019s a matter of how do we really start to engage with the companies, and get them hooked up?</p><p><strong>TechCrunch: Any parting thoughts?</strong></p><p>Daniel Huttenlocher: Yeah. We\u2019ve gotten ourselves as a world into a place where we\u2019re not creating enough good jobs. This isn\u2019t really just about New York. It\u2019s really about global innovation. Every city has its own flavor, that people identify with, and that helps to create great new companies. I mean, this won\u2019t stop me from spending quality time in Silicon Valley\u2026. If we can get a bunch of tech-oriented cities, that\u2019s good for everyone.</p>", "title": ["Interview: Cornell\u2019s Dean Huttenlocher, On Expanding Into NYC And Building A Tech Ecosystem"], "author": ["Eric Eldon"]},

{"date": ["2013-12-10"], "text": "<p></p><p>A small Silicon Valley startup called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.matternet.us\">Matternet</a> has been developing drone delivery technology for several years now. The company\u2019s co-founder and CEO Andreas Raptopoulos\u2019 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/andreas_raptopoulos_no_roads_there_s_a_drone_for_that.html\">TED talk from this past summer</a> about the potential to use small drones for delivery purposes has garnered more than 200,000 views since it was posted online last month \u2014 and perhaps helped to inspire Bezos himself, as Bezos used some of the same language used in Raptopoulos\u2019 TED talk when unveiling the concept of Amazon Prime Air on <em>60 Minutes</em>. </p><p>One very interesting thing about Matternet is that the company believes drone delivery technology should be first used in the developing world, to deliver food, medicine, and other necessities to areas that are less accessible by car or truck. Often, consumer technologies start by serving a higher end market and trickle down to attain widespread utility \u2014 think computers, cell phones, automobiles, and the like. Matternet says its approach is to introduce drone delivery technology to the \u201cpeople who need it the most,\u201d and build the network from there.  </p><p>It was a pleasure to have Raptopoulos and his Matternet co-founder Paola Santana stop by TechCrunch\u2019s San Francisco headquarters last week to talk more about how their technology is progressing, the unique technical and regulatory challenges that drones face, and their reaction to learning that Amazon is working in the space as well.

It\u2019s an Android device that is an iPhone competitor. But rather than rip the iPhone directly, they instead rip the fact that the iPhone 4 is only available on AT&amp;T\u2019s sub-par network.

The last time was when I opened the Sphero and set it loose on my rug.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.gosphero.com/\">Sphero</a> is a ball with a brain. Designed by Orbotix, this 3-inch toy has an internal motor and a set of LEDs that can make it flash nearly any color of the rainbow. It\u2019s run by iOS or Android apps that allow you to control the Sphero, play virtual golf, and draw images in light (albeit in a roundabout way).</p><p>We live in interesting times when it comes to hardware. It\u2019s easier than ever to create cool stuff, as evidenced by the rise of gadgets like the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/Fitbit\">Fitbit</a> and the Parrot AR.Drone. The Sphero is no exception. It\u2019s one of the coolest hardware projects I\u2019ve seen in a while and the ease-of-use and simplicity of the concept is impressive.</p><p>Sphero is a toy and the kids in my house really enjoyed it\u2026 for a while. Sadly, I think Sphero will be relegated to the bottom of the toy box far too soon and the various apps that interact with it, while fun, aren\u2019t all that compelling. After all, there are only so many ways you can sell \u201cMake ball go forward. Now make ball turn green\u201d before you get bored. </p><p>As a technological artifact, the ball is incredible. When\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve seen a small, self-propelled ball with built-in gyroscope, accelerometer, Bluetooth radio, and compass? You could put a little explosive in these and they could be a Bond villain.</p><p>Is the Sphero fun? Sure, for about a day. It would make a great desk or office toy and should be fun for cats (it\u2019s clearly fun for 3-year-olds). It think the ball will be really great once Orbitix releases their SDK, allowing users more control over these wee fellows. For example, I could definitely see some cool applications in experimental robotics. Could you imagine a flock of these things rolling down the street.</p><p>As it stands right now the Sphero is cool \u2013 but maybe not cool enough.

T-Mobile customers want to know what it means for them? AT&amp;T customers want to know what it means for them? Would-be iPhone buyers want to know what it means for them? T-Mobile and AT&amp;T have started <a href=\"http://newsroom.t-mobile.com/articles/more-information-att-acquires-tmobile\">addressing</a> <a href=\"http://mobilized.allthingsd.com/20110320/atts-president-on-why-t-mobile-deal-should-pass-muster-and-wont-be-a-customer-nightmare/\">those</a> already. One thing not addressed yet: what does this mean for Sprint, the nation\u2019s third-largest carrier?</p><p>And it\u2019s an especially poignant question for Sprint because as of last week, many at that company believed they would be merging with T-Mobile, we\u2019ve heard.</p><p>Specifically, we\u2019re hearing from a source with direct knowledge of such a deal that Sprint believed they were in the driver\u2019s seat to land T-Mobile. It\u2019s not clear if anything had been formalized or if discussions were still ongoing, but a \u201cdesperate\u201d Sprint was said to be putting it all out there to get a deal done. This news echoes <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-03-08/sprint-deutsche-telekom-said-to-discuss-t-mobile-usa-deal.html\">a report from three weeks ago by Bloomberg</a> that stated Sprint and Deutsche Telekom were discussing such a deal.</p><p>And a few second-hand accounts state that those at T-Mobile USA were also thinking that Sprint was the likely acquirer. T-Mobile USA CEO Philipp Humm\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2011/exclusive-tmobile-usa-ceo-employees-sale-att-best-solution\">email to employees</a> about the AT&amp;T deal this afternoon may point to that. \u201c<em>I know this news is unexpected and may be somewhat unsettling, but I am confident that our strong culture and T-Mobile USA Values will help guide us through this process</em>,\u201d he wrote. That wording suggests that the deal with AT&amp;T went down very quickly. And again, it may also speak to a change from the Sprint endgame that many had assumed.</p><p>Of course, from a technology perspective, the T-Mobile/AT&amp;T deal would seem to make more sense. Both run a GSM-based network, whereas Sprint has a CDMA network, like Verizon. That said, as both T-Mobile and AT&amp;T have made clear, the main impetus behind this deal is the 4G LTE networks going forward \u2014 GSM and CDMA go out the window when those hit.</p><p>And while AT&amp;T is already saying they don\u2019t believe government regulators will hold up the T-Mobile deal (what else are they going to say?), they acknowledge that it should take a year for it to complete. The T-Mobile\u00a0acquisition\u00a0would give AT&amp;T a combined customer base of about 130 million \u2014 surging it into the number one position in the U.S., far ahead of Verizon\u2019s slightly more than 100 million customers. And that means both AT&amp;T and Verizon will now have more than double the number three carrier, Sprint.</p><p>A Sprint/T-Mobile merger would have given them around 85 million customers. That would have put them only 10 million or so behind AT&amp;T. Obviously, regulators would have looked more favorably at that\u00a0maneuver, since it would mean a more level playing field.</p><p>But it was not to be. It\u2019s not known why exactly at this point, but Bloomberg\u2019s original report stated that the price may have been the hold up. They cited an analyst saying that a $25 billion offer may be too high a price for suitors. And yet,\u00a0AT&amp;T\u2019s offer was some $14 billion more \u2014 and includes an 8 percent stake in AT&amp;T, and a Board seat. Perhaps that\u2019s how and why AT&amp;T swooped in so fast for the win.

{"date": ["2011-11-29"], "text": "<p>There\u2019s a lot of skepticism about the success potential of UltraViolet, a new cloud based digital distribution format designed to make digital rights management work across devices. That\u2019s because people hate DRM, but also because the standard currently lacks support from Amazon and iTunes, the two biggest digital video sellers and renters. I wanted the real story on where UltraViolet is going, so I sat down with the Tim Dodd, VP and GM of Neustar Media, developers of the technology that powers UltraViolet. Watch here on TCTV as he defends UltraViolet, explains how it works on iOS devices without support from iTunes, and claims that there\u2019s still a future in physical media.</p><p>Last year, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/20/dece-ultraviolet-apple/\">UltraViolet emerged</a> as the Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem coalitions choice to power DRM. Hollywood hoped that users would be more likely to continue buying DVDs and Blu-Rays if they could also stream the same content across console, web, and mobile devices. Last month, the first UltraViolet films went on sale from Warner Bros, and they were supposed to play on iOS devices via the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/04/warner-bros-acquires-social-movie-site-flixster-and-rotten-tomatoes/\">Flixster app the studio recently acquired</a>.</p><p>But the UltraViolet launch was <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/video/flixster-itunes-ultraviolet/\">a disaster</a>. Customers complained that they had bought DVDs that came with a \u201cdigital copy\u201d only to find they didn\u2019t actually get to download a copy. Instead they had use buggy UltraViolet through the crash-prone Flixster app, and couldn\u2019t play the films in iTunes. Things got so bad that Warner Bros started distributing free iTunes download codes to customers.</p><p>Still, Dodd is optimistic. He thinks it\u2019s only a matter of time before more content producers and retailers adopt UltraViolet. I agree that retailers are in need of a way to keep digital from cannibalizing their sales,\u00a0and that cross-device content rights are what users want. However, I think users are only going to buy an UltraViolet DVD instead of buying it on iTunes if they can easily play it on all the most popular devices. Right now, they can\u2019t.</p><p>Apple has little incentive to cooperate. It has its own DRM system FairPlay, and accounts for such a big percentage of digital sales and rentals that Hollywood can\u2019t afford to pull their content from iTunes to pressure Apple into adopting UltraViolet. Apple makes its money on hardware, so it\u2019s in its interest to prevent the content it sells through iTunes from being played on other devices. Apple could even flex its muscle and ban a dedicated UltraViolet player app for mimicking native functionality.</p><p>The only way I can foresee UltraViolet succeeding in any capacity is for it to be expressly anti-Apple. Neustar would need to get Amazon to adopt UltraViolet, concentrate on offering a great Android experience, and publicly hammer Apple and its FairPlay DRM for not permitting interoperability. As nice as a future sounds where you buy content and can play it on any device, a fractured ecosystem seems more plausible right now.</p>", "title": ["How Neustar Plans To Make UltraViolet DRM Work, With or Without Apple (TCTV)"], "author": ["Josh Constine"]},

It also won 77 smaller licenses in the B-Block.  Google did not win any licenses. And AT&amp;T won 227 small licenses, which might be good to fill in areas of coverage where it is currently weak.  Satellite TV provider Echostar also won enough licenses to put together a national service,which could expand its ability to offer two-way broadband services.  Also, the D-Block reserved for emergency services will be re-auctioned (it didn\u2019t attract the minimum bid).</p><p>So it looks like my <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/01/spectrum-auction-theory-watch-for-a-sneak-attack-from-the-mississippi-valley/\">Mississippi Valley Sneak Attack </a>theory might have been right and it was Verizon that <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/04/regional-bets-pull-ahead-in-wireless-spectrum-auction/\">won individual regional licenses</a> instead of taking Google head-on in a bid for the national license (I am still speculating what Google did, but that is what it looks like).</p><p>The real winner here is Google precisely because it lost. Google committed to bidding the <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/22/the-fcc-needs-to-listen-to-google/\">minimum $4.6 billion</a> that would trigger open device and open application rules that it had <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/31/fcc-fails-to-mark-their-place-in-history/\">lobbied</a> for, but nobody seriously thought it actually wanted to win the auction.  Building out and operating a wireless network is a much lower-margin business than search advertising, and even leasing out the spectrum would have been a distraction.  But by putting its $4.6 billion on the table early, it was able to dictate the new rules of the game.  Rules that Verizon is now stuck with.  <a href=\"http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2008/03/end-of-fcc-700-mhz-auction.html\">All Google really wants</a> are broadband wireless networks that cannot discriminate against Google mobile apps or Android phones no matter who operates them.</p><p>And what if Google had won?  It was never really that risky a move.  There are worse places to park your cash than in wireless spectrum, something for which demand is always going up and supply is always going down.</p><p>(Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jurvetson/198423053/in/photostream/\">Steve Jurvetson</a>)</p>", "title": ["Breaking: FCC Confirms that Big Winner in Spectrum Auction is Verizon.

Those are the reactions because nearly all Microsoft employees <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2012/11/a-microsoft-without-sinofsky.html\">found out</a> about the news tonight alongside the rest of us.</p><p>Microsoft and Sinofsky\u00a0are trying to spin this as a \u201cmutual decision\u201d \u2014 and understandably so. That\u2019s how this works. Nearly all of these types of exits are \u201cmutual\u201d until reported otherwise. From my understanding, this is no different. The details will undoubtedly trickle out in the days to come, but based on conversations with no less than a dozen current and former Microsoft employees ranging from mid to high-level, Sinofsky was indeed let go and the decision was made (or finalized) this morning, quickly. The \u201cmutual\u201d stuff is all about letting a longtime lieutenant save face.</p><p>But why? That\u2019s the big question that no one seems quite sure about just yet. There are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/12/3638340/microsoft-steven-sinofsky-departure-personality\">whispers</a> of internal division and strife. I have some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/parislemon/status/268170749045522434\">other thoughts</a> that may play out over the next few months. But the reality is that we just don\u2019t know right now. The strife card makes sense to play given the recent departure of iOS SVP Scott Forstall from Apple. On the surface (forgive me), there seems to be many parallels. But in a few respects, this Sinofsky situation appears to be almost the opposite of that situation.</p><p>The iOS Maps debacle gave Apple some cover to do something they\u2019ve wanted to do for some time: get rid of Forstall. This Sinofsky move is \u201cout of the blue,\u201d as two sources put it. That Microsoft and others can play it off as \u201cthis is no different from the recent Apple transition\u201d is convenient, but\u2026</p><p>Sinofsky was the guy that nearly everyone I spoke with thought was going to be the next CEO of Microsoft. In fact, many believed he was no-so-secretly being \u201cgroomed\u201d for the role. And yet, he now finds himself out of the company.</p><p>Many I spoke with thought it was way too early for Surface sales to have anything to do with this exit. The same seems to be true of Windows 8, though the writing may have been a bit more clear on that wall\u2026 At the end of the day, this immediate move \u2014 and how many things that Microsoft does are immediate? \u2014 did not happen for no reason. It just may take some time for that reason to become apparent. But it\u2019s there, right now, in front of us.</p><p>Microsoft would not get rid of the \u201cfuture CEO of the company\u201d on a random night in November after 23 years of service and right after the launch of two key products under his watch for no reason. This is not Apple CEO Tim Cook making a move one year into the job in an attempt to create an operating flow closer to his managerial style. Steve Ballmer has been in charge of Microsoft for nearly 13 years and Sinofsky has been close by for all of those years.</p><p>People on the outside thought Scott Forstall had a shot of being the next CEO of Apple, but <em>people on the</em> <em>inside</em> <em>were sure</em> that Steven Sinofsky was going to be the next CEO of Microsoft. Instead, he\u2019s just the latest in a string of executive departures over the past few years. And any spin that this was \u201cplanned\u201d or \u201cmutual\u201d reeks of bullshit. Steven Sinofsky is taking the fall for something. (Or something is not being disclosed.) And we\u2019re all going to know what that is soon.</p><p>In the meantime, feel free to listen to Sinofsky himself try to pre-empt speculation about his departure:</p><p>So, Sinofsky woke up today and decided he didn\u2019t want to be CEO of Microsoft. He decided he wanted to sleep in.

On paper, however, the company does look like it has the kind of traction that is attractive to Venture Capital. </p><p>(Update: Two of Ticketbis\u2019 backers are VC funds of sorts, albeit partly public/state funded: Seed Capital is a venture capital fund and EU project, dedicated to the promotion and development of \u2018innovative\u2019 start-ups, and Gesti\u00f3n de Capital Riesgo del Pa\u00eds Vasco is a venture capital Management company founded in 1985 by the Basque Government through the Society for the Promotion of Industry.)</p><p>To that end, Ticketbis says that in the first 6 months of this year it\u2019s booked $18 million in sales, which is already in excess of the $15 million invoiced in the whole of 2012. It makes money by charging a small commission to the buyer and seller on each ticket sold through its platform.

Interestingly, it cites its \u201cambitious internationalisation plan\u201d as key to that growth, and says that approximately half of its turnover comes from Europe, with the remainder coming from Latin America.</p><p>Its three main ticket categories are Sports, Concerts and Theatre with the platform currently offering more than one million tickets to events in various parts of the world.</p>", "title": ["Spain\u2019s Ticketbis Raises Further $4.5M For Its After-Market Ticket Exchange"], "author": ["Steve O'Hear"]},

Now it\u2019s opening for business in New York City, and has raised some additional funds to go after that market.</p><p>To expand into the Big Apple and other markets, GetTaxi has raised an additional $12 million in funding, which was led by European fund Kreos Capital, with participation from existing investors. With the close of the new round, total funding for the company is now up to $42 million.</p><p>The funding comes as GetTaxi is launching a new offering in New York City. The company first set its sights on the city more than a year ago, announcing its plans to go after the market when it raised its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/06/gettaxi-20-million-funding-new-york-city-us-expansion/\">$20 million Series B round</a>. It\u2019s taken a while to get there, but the company now believes its well positioned to offer an alternative to existing yellow cab and other apps there.</p><p>For GetTaxi to go after New York City, it sought to differentiate itself in what is becoming an increasingly crowded market for hailing transportation with a mobile phone. There\u2019s Uber for finding black cars, and there\u2019s also a wide range of taxi apps competing as part of the city\u2019s e-hail trial.</p><p>According to founder and CEO Shahar Waiser, one of the biggest problems in New York is simply a constrained supply of cabs. Rather than use traditional taxis, the company is partnering with livery services in the city to provide a low-cost black car alternative. So it launched its new \u201cG-Car\u201d service there.</p><p>In that sense, the service will most resemble Uber, but Waiser says there are some important differences: For one thing, the price is designed to be affordable and predictable. The company has been working hard with its black car partners to set up a pricing and payment structure that was fair to consumers as well as drivers, and it thinks it\u2019s struck the right balance.</p><p>The service touts flat fares between neighborhoods, which don\u2019t change based on time spent in the car or distance traveled. In other words, there\u2019s no fine for being stuck in traffic. There will also be no surge pricing, as one might find with Uber.</p><p>While any consumer will be able to use the GetTaxi service, the company has specialized in getting corporate clients set up around the world. In its 20 markets, it has more than 1,500 corporate clients, including Google, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, among others.</p><p>GetTaxi\u2019s funding comes as a whole bunch of money is pouring into taxi, black car, and ride sharing services around the world. Uber is in the midst of raising a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/uber-tpg-3-5b/\">massive round of funding</a>, rumored to be around $200 million. Meanwhile, cab services like Flywheel and EasyTaxi are <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/easy-taxi-rocket-internets-latin-american-hailo-comes-to-africa-with-another-10m-in-funding/\">racking up</a> <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/31/flywheel-series-b-cab-taxi-app/\">new funds</a> as well.

Colleen Ross, StoryCorps\u2019 marketing and communications director, says the organization is looking at ways to integrate communication tools like Skype, Google Hangouts, and Facebook Messenger, so people who live far apart from one another can record interviews with each other.</p><p>Other features planned for the next 12 to 18 months include more social tools and optional transcription fields for people to save printable copies of their interviews. A Windows Phone version of the app has already been tested and is tentatively scheduled for release later this year.</p><p>Later on, StoryCorps plans to add multiple language support. This will make it easier for people in other countries to use the app, which has been downloaded by more than 200,000 users, for oral history projects.</p><p>Before the app\u2019s launch in March, almost all StoryCorps\u2019 interviews were conducted at staffed recording booths in cities across the United States. While its booths, which produce professional quality recordings, represent the classic StoryCorps experience, the app gives hundreds of thousands of people around the world access to the program for\u00a0personal interviews or larger-scale oral history projects. Groups that have used the app to collect stories\u00a0include <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://storycorps.me/user/womenthetable/\">Women@TheTable</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://storycorps.me/user/paul-swider/\">Young African Leaders Initiative Network</a>.</p><p>The StoryCorps app is more than just a recording tool. It provides a list of questions and serves as an icebreaker for people who might not have had a sustained, face-to-face conversation (StoryCorps interviews are usually 45 minutes long) in a long time. Many pairs are made up of intergenerational relatives, and a StoryCorps recording gives them a safe context to ask questions that might otherwise seem too sensitive or awkward.</p><p>Isay founded StoryCorps twelve years ago to preserve experiences from people who are often overlooked by historians. Recordings made in StoryCorps\u2019 booths are stored in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.loc.gov/folklife/\">American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress </a>and app users can also elect to have their interviews preserved in its archives or uploaded to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://storycorps.me/\">StoryCorps.me</a>.</p><p>\u201cThe app has enabled StoryCorps to extend our reach to locations beyond where our StoryBooths are located.

Should all go well, the new spectrum could be used to create a new open-access wireless broadband \u201cpipe\u201d into people\u2019s homes and devices. If things go less well, the existing wireless giants would buy the spectrum and impose similar usage restrictions that exist on cellular networks in the U.S. today, putting us further behind Europe and Asia.</p><p>CEO Eric Schmidt sent a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/20070720_wireless.html\">letter</a> to FCC Chairman Kevin Martin stating that they would commit to bid at least $4.6 billion in the auctions if four key platform rules are adopted. These rules will define what types of services the winner could offer, and would require third party access to the bandwidth:</p><p>Given the <a href=\"http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/05/are-us-cellphone-carriers-calcified/\">sorry state </a>of the mobile landscape in the U.S., I\u2019d expect the FCC to adopt these pro-consumer rules without any fuss. But the incumbent players, including AT&amp;T and Verizon, are saying they are <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070710-fcc-chairmans-draft-rules-for-700mhz-auction-call-for-open-access.html\">opposed</a> to open access and may not participate if these rules are adopted. Google\u2019s public move was made to let the FCC (and the public) know that there are companies very happy to bid in an open-access world.</p><p>AT&amp;T\u2019s <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2007/07/20/att-responds-to-google-wireless-bid/\">response</a> to Google\u2019s letter was breathtaking in its audacity:</p><p>For anyone who doesn\u2019t look too closely at the issue, AT&amp;T\u2019s response seems very reasonable: keep government regulation out of the spectrum let the market decide which services win. But that isn\u2019t really what would happen at all. If fewer government restrictions are placed on the bandwidth the auction winners will be able to extract more profits at the expense of competitors and consumers. So naturally they don\u2019t want to see open access rules like those recommended by Google. The incumbents also don\u2019t want to see Google play in their sandbox and bidding against them \u2013 so they have yet another reason to oppose their proposal.</p><p>The FCC has competing goals of maximizing revenue from the auction (suggesting less regulation) and protecting the public (suggesting more rules to force competition). Having open access requirements like those suggested by Google will spur competition and grow an economy around this spectrum. It will also put commercial pressure on mobile operators and broadband companies to reduce the restrictions they have on current broadband and mobile services.</p><p>Google isn\u2019t always not evil, but in this case they are going to bat for all of us against some players with pretty bad history when it comes to offering consumer products. I\u2019m behind them on this. And to the FCC: please learn from past mistakes, ignore the lobbyists this time, and do what is in the best interests of the public.</p>", "title": ["The FCC Needs To Listen To Google"], "author": ["Michael Arrington"]},

The Verizon iPhone is coming. Today, Fortune has the 15th or so <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/08/verizon-iphone-january/\">confirmation</a> that the device will launch in early 2011. There\u2019s way too much smoke now for there not to be a fire. But even more interesting than that tidbit is <a href=\"http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/10/29/verizon_iphone_seidenberg/\">Fortune\u2019s interview</a> with <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/ivan-seidenberg\">Ivan Seidenberg</a>, the CEO of Verizon. He wouldn\u2019t speak directly about a Verizon iPhone launch, but he still had plenty to say about the device, and Apple\u2019s CEO <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/steve-jobs\">Steve Jobs</a>.</p><p>The most interesting thing he had to say was the last bit about the iPhone in the piece:</p><p>That sounds like it\u2019s Jobs more or less saying that he respects Verizon because they stood up to him. They wouldn\u2019t\u00a0compromise\u00a0on their vision.</p><p>And that, of course, implies that AT&amp;T was the \u201ceasy\u201d company in that scenario. That is, they\u2019re the ones who were easily romanced into bed. It only took a few drinks. And it sounds as if Apple was fine to have their fling with AT&amp;T while they waited on Verizon, the company they wanted to marry. The company of their dreams. And now the two finally appear ready to tie the knot.</p><p>The fact that Apple approached Verizon first (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/07/verizon-iphone-apple/\">this has been reported before</a>), way back in 2005, says it all. The company originally wanted to partner with Verizon instead of AT&amp;T, but neither Verizon nor Apple were willing to\u00a0compromise.

Before the launch of the iPhone in 2007, Seidenberg went back to Jobs to break their scorned lover silence. While Apple was already dating AT&amp;T at that point, they agreed to keep flirting on the side.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-237898\" title=\"mp2\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/mp2.jpg?w=630&amp;h=324\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"324\"></p><p>After the iPhone\u2019s successful launch, problems with AT&amp;T began to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/can-att-handle-the-iphone/\">arise</a> almost immediately (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/19/att-iphone/\">this has also been reported before</a>). And so in December of 2007, Lowell McAdam (an exec who will be the next Verizon CEO) called the then more vulnerable Jobs to rekindle the flame:</p><p>But with both sides still wanting their way, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/10/apple-att-iphone-agreement/\">the AT&amp;T contract in their way</a>, not much tangible happened until this past month when the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/14/verizon-ipad-iphone/\">iPad went for sale in Verizon\u2019s stores</a>. This was sort of like Price Charles making an official appearance with Camilla Parker Bowles for the first time \u2014 but only as an \u201cunofficial companion\u201d. The wedding is soon to follow.</p><p>AT&amp;T, meanwhile, is already playing the \u201cyou\u2019ll never love them as much as you love me\u201d card:</p><p>Don\u2019t worry AT&amp;T, you\u2019ll still get some action on the side.

To hear the chief executive tell it, those electric drones \u2014 or \u201coctocopters\u201d as he referred to them \u2014 could make for delivery times as low as 30 minutes. Naturally, the size of those drones means there\u2019s a strict upper limit to how much cargo they can carry, but Bezos says they can carry packages of up to five pounds for round trips as long as 10 miles. Thankfully for Amazon, that means nearly 86 percent of the items that it carries can be lashed onto one of its sky-bound couriers.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-921626\" alt=\"amazon-primeair\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/amazon-primeair.png?w=758&amp;h=378\" width=\"758\" height=\"378\"></p><p>Just don\u2019t expect to see one of them land on your doorstep any time soon.

This means you could, say, put a collectable figurine on one printer, watch it get ground away, and then pick up a nearly exact copy at another location. There would be only one copy of the object as the data transferred between machines is quickly destroyed once the object is printed.</p><p>The system uses a pair of 3D printers.

The company studied the apps released in the iTunes App Store and Android Market over a 17-week period between May 16th and September 8th, 2011, to determine its findings. During this time, there were 91,754 iOS apps released into the iTunes App Store and 122,220 apps released into the Android Market.</p><p>Yes, that\u2019s a lot of apps! The company reported earlier in December that the app count rose to 987,863 across all four platforms (iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone) and is now growing at an average of 2,000 apps\u00a0per day. In the last 12 months, iOS apps grew from 338,000 to 589,148. Android apps grew from 115,000 to 319,774.</p><p>During the 119 days of the study, Mobilewalla sorted apps by the day of the week they were released. However, it should be noted that on Android, developers control the release date, while iOS apps\u2019 release dates are affected by the iTunes review cycle. So it may not be fair to proclaim Wednesday as developer\u2019s \u201cfavorite\u201d day universally, given that they\u2019re not always in control of the release timeframe.</p><p>Even if Sunday was not always the developers\u2019 chosen launch day, Mobilewalla found that apps released then statistically performed the best. That is, they made it into the list of the top 240 mobile applications. In this case, Mobilewalls is defining the \u201ctop 240\u201d apps as those that achieve the highest ranking in their respective stores. 42% of the iOS apps released on a Sunday made it into the top 240, while 11% of Android apps did the same.</p><p>Meanwhile, Thursdays were the worst day to release apps on Android, as only 7% of apps reached the top 240 then.

The POS solution will enable existing Shopify users to unify their online shops with their physical locations, sharing information on inventory, sales and more seamlessly between both.</p><p>This is the second in Shopify\u2019s one-two punch to bring its ecommerce solution up to the next level.

Now, 366 days later, Lyft is celebrating the anniversary of that launch with some huge news: It\u2019s raised a $60 million round of financing led by Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>The new funding will give Lyft a huge shot in the arm as it plans to expand aggressively both in the U.S. and internationally, according to founder John Zimmer. And it will have Andreessen Horowitz to help, as a16z general partner Scott Weiss will be joining the board and the firm will be lending some of its operational experience to Lyft as it scales up.</p><p>\u201cAndreessen Horowitz has demonstrated that they are the top VCs in the world to work alongside entrepreneurs and build real and established businesses,\u201d Zimmer told me. \u201cIt\u2019s great to work alongside someone like Scott, and Mark and Ben, who have built really large companies and are willing to roll up their sleeves and work alongside us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why [Andreessen Horowitz] came together as an organizing principle. All of us have scaled companies,\u201d Weiss said. As it pertains to Lyft and its growth moving forward: \u201cNow it\u2019s an execution play of bringing this out to the entire world. It\u2019s about, \u2018How do you bring in management talent and move faster than you thought you could?\u2019 We\u2019re going to put the full weight of the firm behind [Lyft] doing that.\u201d</p><p>In addition to its new funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Lyft is also confirming a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/30/lyft-zimride-15m-series-b/\">$15 million round led by Founders Fund</a>, which we reported on earlier this year. Altogether, the company has raised a total of about $83 million since being founded as Zimride in 2007. Along with Weiss and founders Zimmer and Logan Green, the Lyft board of directors also includes Founders Fund principal Geoff Lewis, as well as Raj Kapoor, who had invested in the company as managing director of Mayfield Fund.</p><p>The funding comes as Lyft is already growing rapidly in all of its markets, including San Francisco, where it competes against ride share offerings from Uber and SideCar. There\u2019s also growing adoption of taxi e-hail apps such as Flywheel and hybrid taxi-community app InstantCab. With mounting competition, Lyft has more than doubled its number of drivers in its launch market, and is still trying to keep up with demand.</p><p>The incredible growth that Lyft has shown is one thing that impressed Weiss and Andreessen, as they evaluated the company for investment. \u201cTwo months ago, they were doing 14,000 rides a week,\u201d Weiss told me. \u201cNow they\u2019re doing 30,000 rides a week.\u201d</p><p>Lyft is also seeing fast adoption in new markets. It <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/30/lyft-cpuc-deal-la/\">launched service in Los Angeles</a> in January, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/lyft-cherry-acqui-hire-seattle/\">Seattle in March</a>, and <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/09/zimride-no-more-lyft-chicago/\">Chicago earlier this month</a>. In each case, both the number of drivers and passengers who have signed on in the first several weeks of a new market has outpaced the market that preceded it.</p><p>With the new funding in place, Lyft plans to accelerate its expansion schedule. The company <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/lyft-cherry-acqui-hire-seattle/\">brought on Cherry co-founder Travis VanderZanden to lead operations</a> and, with three or four launches under its belt, the team thinks it\u2019s got its expansion playbook down. Lyft will be hiring in all aspects of its business \u2014 community, engineering, operations, and public policy \u2014 as it plans to scale globally. Yes, globally.</p><p>While it plans to expand into a number of new markets, the Lyft team recognizes that there will be challenges on the regulatory front as it attempts to get regulators on board with the idea of on-demand ride-sharing services. Competitor SideCar has faced regulatory scrutiny in a number of new markets that it has launched in, including Austin, Philadelphia, and New York City.</p><p>So how does Lyft plan to convince regulators that its service should be allowed to operate? Safety is key.</p><p>\u201cI think this is the year for a lot of that [regulation] to get ironed out,\u201d Zimmer told me. \u201cOur approach is and always will be to work together with regulators and stress what\u2019s important, which is safety. I think technology can actually get us to a safer place.\u201d</p><p>For Lyft, that includes background checks and driver safety checks. But the company goes above and beyond that, trying to hire drivers who are actually, you know, friendly and nice to talk to. And, of course, it ties everything back to an identity layer, requiring all drivers and passengers to connect to a Facebook account. That helps to ensure that, even if something does go wrong, Lyft has a way to identify both parties in the case of a ride gone bad.</p><p>Weiss admits that requiring someone\u2019s real identity through Facebook Connect could limit the potential market in some ways, but it also builds a required level of trust between driver and passenger. Breaking that trust barrier is necessary when you\u2019re talking about peer-to-peer services, and Lyft appears to have succeeded. For instance, more than 50 percent of Lyft passengers are women, Weiss notes.</p><p>So far, its safety record is one of the main reasons that Lyft has won over regulators in jurisdictions like California. And it\u2019s a key part of Lyft\u2019s plan to get regulators in upcoming expansion markets to allow ride sharing in their cities.</p><p>Lyft has plenty of work ahead, Zimmer admits. But he\u2019s confident that the company is on the right track to bring peer-to-peer rides to the world, and in doing so, fundamentally improve the transportation industry. About 80 percent of seats in cars are empty today, and Lyft wants to change that. The funding is just a small part of what will help get the company there, as Lyft is still on \u201cpage one\u201d of a 100-page story, Zimmer says.</p><p>\u201cFor us, raising money is not what we set out to do,\u201d Zimmer tells me. \u201cWe want to change the world and create a new form of transportation. Now we have all the ingredients we need to build out our community and make transportation more affordable and efficient.\u201d</p><p>For Weiss, the idea of establishing a peer-to-peer marketplace around transportation was fundamentally different from what others in the space were doing and is part of what attracted him to Lyft\u2019s model. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that Lyft was using smart phone technology to make existing transportation systems [like cabs and limos] better,\u201d Weiss told me. \u201cIt was using the existing capacity of cars already on the road.\u201d</p><p>The end result, they hope, will be a more efficient use of existing resources. In that way, Lyft reminds Weiss a whole lot of Airbnb, another company that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/24/airbnb-bags-112-million-in-series-b-from-andreessen-and-others/\">Andreessen Horowitz made a big bet on</a>. Will Lyft do to transportation what Airbnb did to the tourism and hospitality industry?

The announcement follows news from last week in which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/16/rocket-internet-raises-500m-from-kinnevik-and-access-plans-more-e-commerce-in-emerging-markets/\">Rocket Internet itself got an injection of $500 million</a>, specifically to help build out its startups in emerging economies.</p><p>Today\u2019s round of funding comes from Africa Internet Holding, a JV between Rocket Internet and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://news.cision.com/millicom-international-cellular/r/millicom-strengthens-commitment-to-grow-online-businesses,c9379705\">35% owner, telecoms operator Millicom</a>. This is the same pair that backed Easy Taxi with <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/24/rocket-internet-revs-up-easy-taxi-its-latin-american-hailo-with-15m-in-funding/\">$15 million in June</a>, through another JV, Latin American Internet Holding. That earlier round is being used to expand Easy Taxi in Latin America. So far, Easy Taxi has amassed\u00a01,500,000 downloads and more than 45,000 taxi drivers in markets where it is active, which include\u00a0Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, South Korea and Venezuela.</p><p>\u201cWe want to bring this success to other attractive markets and we see high potential in many Asian and African countries,\u201d said\u00a0Dennis Wang, head of international expansion of Easy Taxi, in a statement.</p><p>Sacha Poignonnec, co-CEO of AIH, tells me that after Nigeria, Easy Taxi will go to eight more countries by the end of this year, including Morocco, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Ghana, South Africa, Algeria, Tunisia and Angola.</p><p>So why Africa? The Samwer Brothers, as we <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/16/rocket-internet-raises-500m-from-kinnevik-and-access-plans-more-e-commerce-in-emerging-markets/\">described last week in a rare interview with the press-shy Oliver Samwer</a>, have built out a global operation based around a strategy of taking tested business models for e-commerce startups into untapped markets\u00a0(\u201cclones\u201d if you want to call them that; Samwer and Rocket obviously beg to differ). Then, Rocket Internet adds more e-commerce startups into the mix to get the most out of the infrastructure that has been put in place. The same goes for Africa and Easy Taxi.</p><p>For starters, the Samwers already have a number of businesses across Africa. \u201cThe good thing is that we already have operations across Africa. We have offices and entities and all logistics set up, plus we understand the huge potential of this growing market. That\u2019s an important advantage that we have,\u201d says Poignonnec.</p><p>Nigeria, he adds, is full of taxi services. They include drivers people hire for full-time work, those who can be hired by the day, and those for short, a la carte trips. The problem, he says, is that these are a challenge for users because of the logistics of the country and reliably calling a driver when you need him (or her). Waiting outside during rainy season to catch cabs, he says, is not an option many people would go for if they had the choice.</p><p>This is where Easy Taxi will come in: the company will be launching will both its existing iOS and Android apps, to tap into the country\u2019s growing middle class of smartphone-owning userss to communicate via the app to find driver. It will also be equipping drivers with devices that will be preloaded with the app so that they can get taxi calls and respond back. After a driver is called, a customer will get pictures of how the drivers will look, their car numbers and an alert when that person has actually arrived.</p><p>Smartphone penetration is growing fast \u2014 some estimate that it will be 50% in a matter of years \u2014 but because Nigeria today is still very much one of the emerging markets with a still-low smartphone penetration, Poignonnec says that Easy Taxi will likely introduce a basic phoning service, tapping into its existing call centre infrastructure that was put in place for e-commerce sites like Jumia.</p><p>\u201cEveryone will say that Nigeria is a challenging market to operate in, but once you have cracked it, you will crack all of Africa. That is what we experienced with Jumia and other ventures, which already became market leaders.\u201d</p><p>In all cases, Easy Taxi is free for consumers to use. The company makes its money by taking a cut from the drivers, who will pay fees on a sliding scale depending on how many rides they give and other factors such as whether they sign up for \u201csubscriptions\u201d with Easy Taxi. Ultimately, Poignonnec says that the fees will work out to no more than 5% of the total takes for rides.</p>", "title": ["Easy Taxi, Rocket Internet\u2019s Latin American Hailo, Comes To Africa With Another $10M In Funding"], "author": ["Ingrid Lunden"]},

The round is expected to be between $150 million and $200 million, at a valuation of about $3.5 billion. The round hasn\u2019t closed yet, but it\u2019s close to being completed, or so our sources say.</p><p>The funding comes as Uber is growing fast, expanding into new territories and adding lower cost services. AllThingsD reports that the company is expected to pull in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130725/fast-car-uber-funding-auction-likely-coming-to-a-close-at-3-5b-valuation/\">$125 million in revenue</a> this year, which is higher than had been expected.</p><p>Uber is now available in more than 35 cities around the world with its on-demand black car service. But it\u2019s quickly adding lower-cost options in many of those markets. In several cities, that means lower-cost hybrid cars taking passengers, while in others, the company is partnering with local taxi companies to use its e-hail service. With the funding, it will likely expand even more quickly.</p><p>TPG isn\u2019t your typical tech investor, although it has held stakes in companies like SurveyMonkey and Travelocity parent company Sabre Holdings. But it has done a fair amount of investing in travel and leisure companies, including a number of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tpggrowth.com/portfolio.php#/sort_transportation\">airlines</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tpggrowth.com/portfolio.php#/sort_leisure\">hospitality businesses</a>.</p><p>On that front, Uber seems like a good fit, as it\u2019s not your typical tech investment. The company is looking to disrupt the urban transportation industry, which has been stifled by decades of regulation. But it\u2019s also built a logistical framework that could be used for any number of things: in the past it\u2019s experimented with barbecue and ice cream delivery, and it\u2019s even been used to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.uber.com/2013/07/25/ubercanalboat/\">order canal boats</a> in Amsterdam and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.uber.com/2013/04/06/sydney-harbour-not-just-for-photographs/\">water taxis in Sydney</a>.</p><p>Google Ventures is also expected to be an investor in the round, according to Gannes and Primack, though we hadn\u2019t heard about that.</p><p>Uber has raised $57 million since being founded in 2009. Its most recent funding round was for $37 million in late 2011, and came from investors that included Menlo Ventures, Jeff Bezos, Goldman Sachs, Benchmark, CrunchFund*, and Troy Carter. Other investors include Benchmark Capital, First Round Capital, Lowercase Capital, Founder Collective, and a whole bunch of angels. </p><p>Uber, TPG, and Google Ventures all declined to comment for this story.</p><p>==<br>\n* <strong>DISCLOSURE:</strong> Some time ago, Michael Arrington founded TechCrunch.

But now it has its sights set on conquering the United States \u2014 and New York City is the first on its list. So, the company is announcing today, it has raised $20 million in brand new funding to help fund its expansion efforts.</p><p>The $20 million serves as a follow-on funding round for GetTaxi, and it was led by previous investors Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries with participation by company founders Shahar Waiser and Roi More. GetTaxi, which was founded in 2010, had previously raised $11 million in outside venture capital, so this round brings its total outside funding to approximately $30 million.</p><p>In the video embedded at the bottom of this post, you can see our interview with Jing Wang Herman, who joined GetTaxi last month to serve as its CEO of US operations. Herman has had a long career in the financial space as a banker, but she has a unique twist: She is also licensed to work as a New York City taxi driver. Herman told us that the taxi industry has long been a passion of hers, and that ordering a cab from a smartphone has been something she\u2019s envisioned for years, so the opportunity to expand GetTaxi\u2019s platform was one she had to jump at.</p><p>Of course, GetTaxi isn\u2019t without its competitors. In the higher-end personal transportation realm <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/uber-2\">Uber</a> has of course taken the space by storm in recent months, and in the cab market apps <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/product/cabulous\">such as Cabulous</a> have cracked other cities such as San Francisco, and apps <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/29/mobile-taxi-network-hailo-raises-17m-from-accel-and-atomico-to-take-on-uber-in-the-u-s/\">such as Hailo</a> have stated aims to get into the NYC market. With its experience growing in the international space, GetTaxi is positioning itself as a reliable and scalable new option \u2014 and one that New York City should choose as its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.yellowcabnyc.com/nyc-taxi/smart-phone-apportunity\">officially recommended</a> taxi-hailing smartphone app.</p><p>Right now, GetTaxi has 100 employees, with Herman the only full-timer in the United States. The company plans to add to its U.S. headcount as it grows in the months ahead.

This would allow for devices like iPhones to perform a number of different functions upon encountering said hyperlinks, just like a user would when browsing the Internet and finding traditional ones.</p><p>Here\u2019s a practical example: A podcast could embed said audio hyperlink, and then pause playback of the primary track when one hits, in order to either call back a specific segment from earlier in the podcast itself, or to open a second audio stream stored on the web and play that back, or even to open another app or call up a video or other website from the web. It could even be used to call up another application and activate a purchase activity, embedding ecommerce opportunities into audio, which would be perfect for deriving affiliate revenue from podcasts or for directing iTunes Radio users to app and music purchase opportunities.</p><p>Currently, Apple\u2019s \u201cenhanced podcast\u201d format can do some of this, but it still requires that metadata be added and that the file be recorded in AAC format. This would put the relevant links directly into the audio stream itself, which would make it much more portable. The audio hyperlink can also be tied to some kind of input trigger, so that uses would have to tap their device, use voice input or otherwise activate a link before it actually works.</p><p>The invention has the potential to make audio files into something truly interactive, and better-suited to the multimedia-rich mobile platforms that exist today. Its obvious benefits would be for audio podcasts, but the tech could also be applied to things like music, video and even ringtones or other notifications.</p><p>This is one of those media format technologies that, even were it introduced tomorrow (unlikely, as it\u2019s a fairly recent patent application from 2012), would take quite a while to gain wide adoption, and might face challenges become very popular unless it were made into an industry standard. But it\u2019s also an exciting invention that could change the way we interact with our computing devices at a fundamental level, so it\u2019s definitely an area worth watching for future developments.</p>", "title": ["Apple Developing Audio Hyperlinks, A Way For Audio Streams To Link To Other Media Or Control Devices"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},

You can follow Matt on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mg\">here</a>.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://yelp.com\">Yelp</a> has had no shortage of hullabaloo <a href=\"http://www.techmeme.com/090827/p83#a090827p83\">surrounding</a> the most recent improvement to its iPhone app.  Rightfully so, it added an Augmented Reality view for its restaurant reviews.  Using the AR view, users of the Yelp app can pan around using their camera, and see information overlaid, presumably, on top of the restaurant of their query, garnering review information.  While this functionality is certainly useful, and nothing short of excellent eye candy, could there be a thorn with this rose?</p><p>Augmented Reality has been all the rage with app developers recently, originally employing unreleased SDK features to build the technology.  However, in recent months, it was discovered that the new iPhone OS 3.1 upgrade changed the camera functionality in a way that would enable app developers to build their Augmented Reality views in a more sanctioned environment.  This development has been a shot in the arm for AR developers, and there seems to be many <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/20/augmented-reality-twitter-app-looks-awesome-hope-apple-thinks-so-too/\">implementations</a> being <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/13/yc-funded-graffitigeo-foursquare-meets-yelp-with-a-dash-of-augmented-reality/\">built</a>.  However, it was understood that the world would have to wait for AR on the iPhone, at least until iPhone OS 3.1 was released.  That was, until, Yelp\u2019s most recent iPhone app got approved in the store with an easter egg that, after shaking the device three times, enabled an Augmented Reality view.</p><p>Call it sneaky, call it clever, but I call it deceit.  Apple has put forth specific guidelines, and \u201crules\u201d around their app development, and while I don\u2019t always agree, it\u2019s the reality of how we must work with them for now.  Yelp hid their easter egg behind shaking the device, which isn\u2019t always the most intuitive action to take on an app that contains some maps and lists.  As a result, the unsanctioned Augmented Reality view was gone from Apple\u2019s radar. The same would seem to be true with a <a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_wall_has_fallen_3_augmented_reality_apps_now_l.php\">couple other applications</a> that snuck in AR features as updates to their apps. As recently as last month, <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/07/subway-augmented-reality-iphone-app.html\">Apple was telling</a> developers making AR apps that they would have to wait for iPhone 3.1. It was only after approval, that Yelp announced that the functionality existed.  There was palpable excitement around the Yelp\u2019s announcement (and the other apps), having been the first AR apps to be approved, but something smelled afoul.</p><p>My concern is that Yelp has set an awful precedent by this act.  Now, every app developer will likely undergo even more scrutiny.  Accessing private API\u2019s goes against the agreement every iPhone developer has to abide by when submitting applications to the App Store.  By subverting this agreement through an \u201ceaster egg\u201d, Yelp could very well cause the approval process to become more draconian.  Whereas before, Apple was primarily looking for trademark violations, \u201ccorrect\u201d usage of their Human Interface Guidelines, and show-stopping bugs, they\u2019ll now have to go over each app with fine-toothed comb to make sure no feature that is likely to be unsanctioned will be released.  Now granted, this may also be seen as a big cry for openness in the App Store, but so long as the App Store approval process remains in the status quo, deceitful acts like this won\u2019t continue to go unnoticed by them.</p><p>The implications are simple: a longer wait time for apps to be approved, longer time for bug fixes and overall, a poorer experience for developers and users both.  While I hope for a less strict App Store, so long as that\u2019s not the case, I hope more that developers stick to more of the straight and narrow (read: not so shady tactics) so they don\u2019t ruin it for the rest of us.</p>", "title": ["How Yelp May Have Further Harmed The App Store Approval Process With Its Easter Egg"], "author": []},

I\u2019m a firm believer that Bluetooth headsets/earbuds are the most ridiculous looking gadget anyone can wear around, but Nokia\u2019s DJ-like headphones have me painting a different picture after the week I\u2019ve spent with them. Was I impressed? Yes. Was I disappointed? Yes. Huh? It was a good disappointment, so keep your pants on.<br><!--more--><br>\nTo the untrained eye, the 604 looks like a regular set of headphones encased in black leather and silver trim, but upon further inspection you\u2019ll notice the flashing blue LED and lack of cord. Something else that\u2019s very distinctive about the 604 is its design. Normal headphones are shaped to rest along the contour of your head, but the 604 juts out around the earcup making it very noticeable. It\u2019s not a bad thing, but it struck me as odd when I pulled them out of the box. They fit like a glove thanks to the padded headband and cushy earcups. But enough about style and design. Let\u2019s get on to the goods.</p><p>I used a Nokia 5300 as my test pilot for the 604 and they automatically synced together when either was turned on. All controls are placed on the right cup, which include: play/pause, next track, previous track, volume control and call button. Turning on the headphones might cause some problems if you don\u2019t read instructions. Clicking and holding the call button does the trick and the LED light flashes blue when on and emits a brief red glow when turned off. Response time is quite fast when you need to pause or play a song, answer a call, or flip through tracks. The volume button is located underneath all the other controls and a push forward pumps up the volume while the opposite action does what you\u2019d expect. Overall, the controls are simple to use and unobtrusive. In other words, they don\u2019t attract any unwanted attention.</p><p>Sound quality during MP3 playback was crisp and clear. I hardly heard any of the street noise and chitter-chatter coming from my roommates. I walked from one end of my apartment to the other, which is about 100ft and sound quality didn\u2019t deteriorate even with a bathroom, kitchen and two bedrooms between the \u2018phones and 5300. Ring, ring, ring. Picking up a call is as easy as pushing a button, which is the case here. If you choose to answer an incoming call your music is paused until you click the call button again to end the conversation and your music resumes playback. Sound quality was also clear during my tests within 40 feet, but once I stepped into my room, which is around 50 feet away clarity on the other end started to crackle. It was still clear for me, so I didn\u2019t really care that my mom couldn\u2019t hear what I had to say. Just joking, mom.</p><p>Battery life on the 604 was surprising to say the least. I\u2019ve been playing music through the headphones for about 15 hours and they\u2019re still chugging along. The 5300 died long before the 604s did. This is where I was disappointed because I just wanted to sleep by hour 11, but it\u2019s certainly not a bad thing. Nokia is boasting 19 hours of playback and I\u2019m inclined to believe it so far. Talk time is a whopping 18 hours and I\u2019ve still got a long ways to go before I hit that mark, but I wouldn\u2019t doubt that number. Recharging the batteries takes less than two hours and a single charge leaves you with two weeks of standby.</p><p>The final version of the 604 may change between now and when it hits the masses in September for $189.95, but I\u2019m not sure what changes would make it better. I\u2019m still a proponent against Bluetooth headsets and the way they make you look like a douche, but the 604 adds style and stealth to your geeky ways. People might think you\u2019re a mad rapper when you\u2019re on a call, but nuts to them. Nokia\u2019s done a good job with the 604 headphones and I give them my thumbs up.</p>", "title": ["CrunchExclusive: Nokia BH-604 Bluetooth Headphone Review"], "author": ["Peter Ha"]},

It must be nice to have a house full of $1200 remotes customized with user profiles and home automation controls. Yes, this remote costs $1200 and that doesn\u2019t include installation and yes, you need it to be installed professionally. This isn\u2019t a Harmony remote that can be set up in 10 minutes. But once it\u2019s installed, holy cow, it\u2019s effen amazing. I would call it the perfect remote, but I had two demo units die on me.<!--more--></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p><strong>Review:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/mx-5000-3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-126799\" title=\"mx-5000-3\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/mx-5000-3-150x150.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150\" alt=\"mx-5000-3\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></a>The first thing you\u2019ll notice about the MX-5000 is the build quality. It feels like a million bucks. The buttons are smooth and hard with just the right amount of pressure needed to press them down. The screen is bright, sharp and very high-res. Even the charger screams high-end. It\u2019s easily the best-feeling remote I have ever used.</p><p>But then I tried to set it up. The company offered to pre-program the remote before they sent it to me, but that insulted my inner nerd. I thought, \u201cHow hard could it be?\u201d Well, after watching four online instructional videos from URC and spending about eight hours, I finally got the remote to communicate with my devices. But after that first, huge learning curve, I feel like I can do almost everything with the remote. I\u2019m sure there are some super-macros that I don\u2019t know about, but I managed to program the remote to control three AV systems (one via RF). I feel like all the CrunchGear writers could program the remote, along with a few of my nerdy friends. However, there is no way that the average Best Buy shopper could. Maybe the average MicroCenter customer.</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/ccp.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-126800\" title=\"ccp\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/ccp-150x150.png?w=150&amp;h=150\" alt=\"ccp\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></a>The issue is that the setup program isn\u2019t meant for the general public or the DIY crowd. It involves using IF THEN statements for macros and manually adding devices\u2019 RF profiles. However, this type of programming allows installers complete control over how the remote controls each system. Anything is possible and installers are not tied down to a wizard.</p><p>Everything is customizable. You use pre-programmed themes or make your own in Photoshop. It\u2019s totally up to the installer to create a pleasant user experience. I\u2019m personally happy with how my UI turned out.</p><p>I found that backgrounds for the BlackBerry Storm are the perfect resolution, and <a href=\"http://www.stormgrounds.com/wallpaper/Miscellaneous/Black-Wood-Grain/\">this one</a> looks great with the brushed look of the remote. My setup allows me to control three different AV systems in my house \u2013 not that I really need that ability. I added a dedicated TiVo button to one of the default layouts and it works great.</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/mx-5000-7.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-126803\" title=\"mx-5000-7\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/mx-5000-7-150x150.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150\" alt=\"mx-5000-7\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></a>The remote also features a Wi-Fi chipset, which enables simple RSS feeds like sports scores, news, and weather to be displayed on the remote. And it can easily control a Windows Media Center PC. The info screens are nifty, but almost a novelty. However, the Windows Media Center control is the coolest function of the remote.</p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;\">All you need to do is tell the remote the Windows Media Center computer\u2019s IP address in the PC programming software and it works. The remote\u2019s touchscreen displays common functions and the navigational pad controls the on-screen GUI. It works flawlessly and is the easiest way to control Windows Media Center with a remote that I have ever used.</span></p><p>But not everyone has the ability to hook up a Media Center PC to their TV. The remote can still access a PC\u2019s music library and provide two-way communication. This means that as long as the PC is hooked up to an audio receiver, the remote can control and play back music and even display album art.</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/mx-5000-4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-126804\" title=\"mx-5000-4\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/mx-5000-4-150x150.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150\" alt=\"mx-5000-4\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></a>I would love to slap a large, \u201chighly-recommended\u201d sticker on the remote but I can\u2019t because of the issues I had with the first two demo units. The first one just stopped working about two weeks after I got it and the other one stopped waking up when I picked up the remote. After disabling the motion sensor in the second demo unit, it worked fine for a while but eventually it started to freeze daily, which was resolved only by pulling the battery. But most of the review samples we get are first-run units so bugs can be expected. The third remote seems to be fine.</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/mx-5000-vs-harmony-900.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-126806\" title=\"mx-5000-vs-harmony-900\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/mx-5000-vs-harmony-900.jpg?w=620&amp;h=394\" alt=\"mx-5000-vs-harmony-900\" width=\"620\" height=\"394\"></a></p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;\">The only real downside to the remote besides the price is that most people will probably need a pro to install it. If URC can come up with a complete, but also easy to use wizard, there is a market for such a remote \u2013 even at the high price. It\u2019s the complete package: candy bar form factor, totally customizable, Wi-Fi- and RF-enabled, and it feels amazing. There is a huge difference in quality and ability between this remote and the <a href=\"http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/08/31/review-logitech-harmony-900-universal-remote/\">$400 Harmony 900</a>, but unless you have cash to burn or a complicated A/V setup, there really isn\u2019t any reason to spend the extra cash. Unless you want the best remote on the planet, that is.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;\"><a href=\"http://www.universalremote.com/product_detail.php?model=173\">Product Page</a></span></p>", "title": ["Review: The $1200 URC MX-5000 remote"], "author": ["Matt Burns"]},

Iwata admitted that Nintendo wasn\u2019t able to transition to its handheld consoles\u00a0\u201cas smoothly as expected.\u201d He denied that the growth of mobile\u00a0means that the business of dedicated games consoles is dead\u00a0but said it would be a waste to not look at opportunities with smartphones.</p><p>\u201cWe have come to hold a stronger passion and vision for the video games console\u201d with this decision, Iwata said. Essentially,\u00a0he believes that compelling mobile games can act as a \u201cbridge\u201d that\u00a0pushes\u00a0more consumers to buy dedicated Nintendo games consoles.</p><p>The alliance will see both sides make 22 billion yen ($181 million investments) in each other. That corresponds to around 10 percent of DeNA stock for Nintendo, while DeNA is picking up\u00a01.24 percent of Nintendo.</p><p>Founded in 1999,\u00a0DeNA may be less known outside of Asia, but it is a multi-billion dollar mobile games firm\u00a0in its own right. It initially emerged with the growth of web-based mobile games in Japan and its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mobage.com/\">Mobage</a> service, but over the past few years it has transitioned into apps making acquisitions along the way, including <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/12/done-deal-dena-to-announce-ngmoco-acquisition-very-soon/\">the $400 million purchase of Ngmoco</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://dena.com/intl/press/2011/09/dena-to-acquire-punch-entertainments-vietnam-studio.html\">social games maker Punch</a>.</p><p>That transition <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/30/ngmoco-dena-freeverse-layoffs/\">hasn\u2019t been easy for the company</a>, particularly with competition from the\u00a0growth of new, dedicated mobile gaming firms that have focused on apps from day one. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pocketgamer.biz/asia/news/60772/dena-fy14-q3-revenues-down-4-percent/\">DeNA\u2019s most recent financials</a> saw revenue dip 17 percent year-on-year to\u00a0$287 million. Operating profit was down 55 percent to $43 million, so it\u2019s fair to say that this tie-in with Nintendo could\u00a0be a very important turning point.</p>", "title": ["Nintendo Partners With DeNA To Bring Its Games And IP To Smartphones"], "author": ["Jon Russell"]},

Streams are shared with a user\u2019s followers, and those watching can comment on what they see and add stars to show their appreciation. Right now, Mirrativ isn\u2019t saving broadcasts though, so there\u2019s no way to revisit streams once they are over.</p><p>DeNA told TechCrunch that an iOS version of the app will come \u201csoon,\u201d but that it will be limited to watching, and not broadcasting, streams. Like Kamcord, DeNA has likely run into problems around support for live-streaming on iOS. That could change when Apple\u00a0introduces its first native replay feature for\u00a0developers in the form of\u00a0<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/08/apple-announces-ios-9/\">ReplayKit in iOS 9</a>, though.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dena.mirrativ&amp;hl=en\">Mirrativ is available now in limited beta form</a>\u00a0ahead of a full launch next month.

Shaffer spoke about how excited he was about the new service.  When asked if anyone could copy what Foursquare was doing, Walker talked about Foursquare\u2019s efforts to filter content (which is harder to reproduce).</p><p>MG then steered the conversation toward bridging the gap between social networks and the real world, noting that mobile devices are paving the way for this change.  But he wondered how services other than <a href=\"http://foursquare.com\">Foursquare</a> (which has a game mechanic) would entice users to share their location on a regular basis.</p><p>Lee addressed concerns over Latitude\u2019s continuous location sharing, explaining that you can share your location with certain people who you specify, but that Latitude\u2019s approach to constant tracking leads to the ability to offer interesting services.  He says that without continuous sharing nearby alerts wouldn\u2019t be possible (or at least as effective).  He says that the check-in model and the continuous model will likely coexist (and that check-in can even help give more context about where you are) but that there\u2019s things you can\u2019t do without continuous tracking.  Regarding Checking in verus continuous mapping, Elad Gil says he\u2019s seeing about a \u201cnine to ten\u201d relationship between them.</p><p>Galligan chimed in by saying that there will be a point when we know where everyone is, but that the context won\u2019t necessarily be known.  Galligan then revealed a new technology they are working on involving four dimensions of geolocation that SimpleGeo has created, which allows them to compress location and time stamps into a datapoint, allowing apps to look into the past for the same location.</p><p>Sarver talked about why Twitter was interested in location, describing how it would help filter through the noise.  He mentioned <a href=\"http://www.trendsmap.com\">TrendsMap.com</a> as a great way to visualize geotagged tweets.</p><p>Shaffer said that HotPotato is looking to integrate location into their service, but that another key element is what brings conversation together.  He says that just location data isn\u2019t necessarily enough (he points out that people watching a baseball game may actually be at the game, or watching on TV.)</p><p>In terms of advertising, there seemed to be a broad consensus that geo-based advertising had the potential to be extremley successful.  Galligan brought up the potential of special ads and deals, pointing to Yowza as a great example.  Saffer later commented that there\u2019s a fine line that these services have to work with \u2014 it would be a negative for ads to actually feel like ads (instead it would be better for them to feel like deals).</p>", "title": ["RealTime CrunchUp: The Rise Of Geo Streams"], "author": ["Jason Kincaid"]},

Of course the flip-side of letting Google\u2019s algorithm crawl all over your camera roll is it\u2019s <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/01/google-photos-reminder-smile-its-free-youre-the-product/\">sucking\u00a0up all sorts of personal data</a>\u00a0based on the intel it can glean from your photos.</p><p>By contrast, Apple has been making <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/08/apple-stresses-user-privacy-at-wwdc/\">increasing loud noises</a> about how its business model does not rely on the accumulation of\u00a0user data \u2014 emphasizing this as a differentiator vs ad-driven business models, like Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s.</p><p>At WWDC earlier this summer Apple debuted an update to its Siri voice assistant, called Proactive, which offers some predictive Google Now-esque features. However the data processing associated with this service is done locally on the user\u2019s device \u2014 rather than via\u00a0cloud processing \u2014 drawing a clear line between Apple and the user\u2019s personal data\u00a0to bolster privacy.</p><p>Returning to the\u00a0facial recognition photo-sharing patent, Apple notes that the\u00a0associated database linking facial recognition info with individuals\u2019 contact details could be stored\u00a0locally or in the cloud:</p><p>If Cupertino does\u00a0implement a facial recognition system for photo distribution, given its strong pro-privacy trajectory, it would be difficult\u00a0to imagine it\u00a0being able to implement\u00a0cloud-based processing or storage of\u00a0such sensitive user info. Local processing would be more in keeping with its current pro-privacy stance.</p><p>That said the patent covers all bases \u2014 describing, for instance, a scenario involving synchronizing previously trained facial recognition data (from a desktop picture organization tool, such as presumably Apple\u2019s own Mac Photos tool) via a \u201ccentral server system\u201d to a mobile device:</p><p>In another method described, the system could even automatically distribute photos to people identified within them if the user has opted in to auto uploads.</p><p>In the push\u00a0to serve the gods of\u00a0convenience the cloud looms large, allowing for digital content to be trivially accessed across multiple devices. But so too do privacy implications. So Apple will have some key\u00a0choices to make as it negotiates how to apply\u00a0more AI- and machine learning-powered features into its software.</p><p>Locking down user privacy when there\u2019s cloud syncing and auto-uploads going on in the background can certainly be a tricky circle to square\u00a0\u2014 as one <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/13/yes-google-photos-can-still-sync-your-photos-after-you-delete-the-app/\">user of Google Photos recently discovered</a>.

{"date": ["2012-12-13"], "text": "<p>Mobile transportation startup Cabulous launched in 2010 with plans to bring Uber-like e-hailing to taxi fleets throughout the country. And while it\u2019s been fairly successful in getting cabs signed up and attracting new customers, the company has decided to rebrand as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flywheelnow.com\">Flywheel</a>, and will be making a big marketing push around the new name in urban markets like New York City and San Francisco.</p><p>Flywheel is available for iOS and Android and its technology works like other on-demand, mobile transportation apps from the likes of Uber, Lyft, and SideCar. There\u2019s just one difference \u2014 rather than electronically hailing a sedan driver or even a regular dude and his car, Flywheel\u2019s technology works with existing taxi dispatch and metering systems. It allows users to hail nearby cabs, rather than relying on a dispatcher to send them to the user\u2019s location.</p><p>The startup doesn\u2019t own taxis, but partners with fleet owners from around the country and works with their existing technology. Since Flywheel integrates with the taxi\u2019s meter, it skirts a lot of the regulatory issues that are cropping up around startups which are relying on GPS data to determine a rider\u2019s fare. The cost is only 60 cents more than the usual rate for the convenience of e-hailing, rather than doing it the old-fashioned way.</p><p>Flywheel <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/21/cabulous-funding/\">raised an $8 million Series A round</a> over the summer, and has raised about $9 million in total since being founded in mid-2010. It\u2019s been using the funding to aggressively expand its service into new markets, and has rounded up more than 2,000 taxis in fleets all around the country. That includes about a third of all cabs in San Francisco.</p><p>Partnering with licensed taxi drivers and fleets could become a huge advantage in the urban transportation market, where other startups are facing increased scrutiny from local governments and regulators. The California Public Utilities Commission recently issued citations against SideCar, Lyft, and Uber for operating unlicensed charter party services in San Francisco. Uber has also faced issues in other markets that it operates in, such as New York City, Boston, and Toronto.</p><p>Since Flywheel works with licensed cabbies, it believes it falls under the existing regulatory framework, and will continue to do so as different cities update rules for e-hailing cabs. But the beautiful thing about the Flywheel brand is that it\u2019s not necessarily limited to taxis \u2014 it could also try to move into the sedan market as well.</p><p>Now that its funding and new brand is in place, Flywheel is looking to do a big marketing push, particularly in important markets like New York City and San Francisco. It\u2019ll be putting advertisements on the tops of cabs from fleets it has partnered with, and will also be introducing stickers in participating taxi windows to reinforce the brand, even with those who didn\u2019t use the app to electronically hail a cab.</p><p>The transportation marketplace is heating up, and there\u2019s likely to be multiple winners from the emergence of e-hail technologies. While Flywheel will compete against ride-sharing and other on-demand transportation services, like Taxi Magic, which also targets licensed cabbies. The good news is that e-hail should mean easier hailing for everyone.</p>", "title": ["Cabulous Rebrands As Flywheel, Plans Major Marketing Push To Bring E-Hail To Cabs Across The US"], "author": ["Ryan Lawler"]},

The app comes from the team behind <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.taskos\">Taskos</a>, one of the most popular To Do list applications on the Android Market.</p><p>More notably, Any.DO is backed by $1 million in angel funding from\u00a0Eric Schmidt\u2019s Innovation Endeavors, Blumberg Capital, Genesis Partners, Palantir (Joe Lonsdale), Felicis Ventures (Aydin Senkut) and Brian Koo and includes Erick Tseng, head of mobile products at Facebook, and Elad Gil, Director of Corporate Strategy at Twitter, as advisors.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.any.do/\">Any.DO</a> was founded in 2010 by Omer Perchik, Yoni Lindenfeld and Itay Kahana and now has offices in both Palo Alto, California and Tel Aviv, Israel.</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screenshot-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-449755\" title=\"Screenshot 1\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screenshot-1.jpg?w=187&amp;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"187\" height=\"300\"></a>The interesting thing about this team\u2019s first app, <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.taskos\">Taskos</a>, was that it was meant to serve as market research only. The founders were surprised how popular it became \u2013\u00a0something that may serve as a reminder about the need for quality apps on the Android platform. Taskos now has 1.3 million users and handles 150,000+ tasks per day. Those users will now be invited to try Any.DO instead, Perchik says.</p><p>When you launch <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.anydo&amp;hl=en\">Any.DO</a>, the first thing you\u2019ll notice is its attractive design. After having been on Android myself for over a year, I can say with confidence that this is still somewhat a rarity for the platform. (Go ahead, flame away). But Any.DO looks great, offering a default white theme and a more \u201cAndroid-y\u201d black theme.</p><p>Like any to do list, Any.DO supports the basics, like adding tasks, marking them complete, setting priorities, etc. But it does a number of other things which make it stand out from the crowd. For example, you can create tasks using voice input, it syncs with Google tasks, and you can use gestures to manage your tasks like drag-and-drop for assigning task priorities or organizing tasks into folders or swiping to mark tasks complete. You can also shake your phone to clear off the completed tasks from the screen.</p><p>However, the most important feature is the app\u2019s backend. This task list app is actually intelligent, offering to auto-complete entries as you type. The suggestions of common words and phrases are gathered through the analysis of aggregate, anonymized data from the app\u2019s users. For example, start typing \u201cca\u2026\u201d and the app may suggest \u201ccall mom,\u201d \u201ccall dad,\u201d \u201ccar wash,\u201d etc. It\u2019s like Google\u2019s auto-complete for tasks.</p><p><a href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screenshot-3.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-449757\" title=\"Screenshot 3\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screenshot-3.jpg?w=214&amp;h=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\"></a>Any.DO also lets you collaborate on tasks with family, friends and colleagues, potentially displacing group texting, email threads and other more socially focused apps like Facebook or GroupMe. It can offer contact suggestions when building collaborative tasks, and for those who are not Any.DO members, the app supports communication via email and SMS. A future version will send non-users\u2019 replies back into the app, too, similar to how GroupMe works today.</p><p>As far as the bigger pictures goes, Any.DO is working towards building out a smarter, more intelligent system that can help you actually get things done, not just list the things you need to do. Details on how exactly that will work are sparse, but a comparison to Siri\u2019s capabilities was hinted at in our conversation with co-founder\u00a0Perchik.</p><p>And no, fellow iPhone users, Any.DO isn\u2019t going to be an Android-only app for long.

If you think of humans in the context of all animals, with us simply residing at the top of the food chain, our relationship with food is pretty weird. Wild animals eat to survive, and if something tastes good, it\u2019s simply an indication that their body can safely digest that food. </p><p>Meanwhile, we\u2019re putting all kinds of crazy chemicals into processed foods that have now made the United States an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Obesity_state_level_estimates_1985-2010.gif\">embarrassingly overweight country</a>. We gorge ourselves on delicious meals like it\u2019s the last time we\u2019ll ever see food, without the slightest consideration that we\u2019ll eat again in a matter of hours. </p><p>If anything, our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://statigr.am/tag/food\">obsession with photographing food</a> is just one more bit of proof that we should adjust our relationship with food. But perhaps this is evolution at play. The more we photograph food, and then stare at it, the less we want it, and eventually Instagram\u2019s #foodporn hashtag will go down in medical journals as the beginning of a new obesity cure (but I doubt it).</p>", "title": ["The Instagram Diet"], "author": ["Jordan Crook"]},

The PUC is calling those operators Transportation Network Companies (TNC) and has built a new regulatory framework for them. The key portions of the proposal revolve around public safety and ensuring that drivers have had background checks and are covered by insurance in the case of an accident. </p><p>The proposal requires that TNCs:</p><p>Discussions between the PUC and the affected startups have been ongoing since last summer when Uber, Lyft and SideCar received <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/08/cpuc-ride-sharing-c-and-d/\">cease-and-desist orders from the regulator</a> for operating unlicensed charter party services. While each of the three have individually reached interim agreements with the PUC, the regulator has also been working on a new framework for regulation that falls outside the existing rules for taxi or limo services in the state.</p><p>The new regulations, if adopted, should clear up uncertainty for the companies in major cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. They could also set a precedent for the adoption of ride-sharing rules that those startups could propose in other states and jurisdictions.</p><p>At the same time, the PUC has been lobbied hard by taxi and limo organizations opposed to the new rules. In San Francisco today, taxi drivers gathered outside government buildings to show opposition to the acceptance of unlicensed drivers roaming the streets. In the past month, officials at the San Francisco International Airport <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2013/07/29/sfo-citizen-arrests-internet-rideshare/\">have been citing and arresting drivers</a> from Uber, Lyft, and SideCar.</p><p>Safety remains the key issue facing these companies, as opponents argue that they\u2019re not subject to the same requirements of taxi and limo services.</p><p>At the same time, Uber, Lyft and SideCar maintain that their community drivers are subject to more stringent background checks than taxi or limo drivers. The existence of an identity layer for both drivers and passengers also ensures that the companies will know who was in the car in the case of any incident.</p><p>The PUC proposal also is happening as venture money is pouring into local transportation startups. Uber <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/uber-tpg-3-5b/\">is close to raising a new round of funding</a> from TPG that will value it at $3.5 billion.

This brings the company\u2019s total funding to nearly $100 million.</p><p>For background, ZestFinance <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/26/zestcash-debuts-new-big-data-underwriting-models-to-determine-consumer-credit-risk/\">takes an entirely different approach</a> to underwriting by combining Google-style machine-learning techniques and data analysis with traditional credit scoring. As a result, the company can help financial service providers better understand credit risk in their own businesses and better understand the creditworthiness of their borrowers. The ZestFinance decisioning infrastructure can run dozens of models in parallel, returning loan decision results within seconds.</p><p>While traditional lenders determine credit-worthiness based on 10-15 pieces of data, ZestFinance uses tens of thousands of data points and machine-based algorithms to better assess credit risk. Last year, the startup debuted a new underwriting model that provides a more accurate depiction of a person\u2019s ability to pay back loans.</p><p>This new model not only increased the quality of underwriting analysis but was also able to give more loans to people. In fact, the approval rate has doubled. For example, in the case of bankruptcy (a strong signal used in underwriting decisions), a traditional underwriting model can quickly calculate the number of years since a person filed bankruptcy, but wouldn\u2019t know that people are only allowed to declare bankruptcy once every seven years. So, ZestFinance is making its algorithms smarter to be able to determine variables like this.</p><p>\u201cGetting credit into the hands of more people is one of the financial service industry\u2019s biggest hurdles. We\u2019ve found that big data done right \u2014 machine learning, combined with human inference \u2014 can solve this problem,\u201d says Merrill.</p><p>Merrill explains further that having Thiel as an investor makes a lot of sense because the PayPal founder transformed the online money transfer and payments space, and disrupted the data-mining space for many financial institutions with Palantir. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve done the same thing in underwriting, and that\u2019s why Peter is interested in us,\u201d he says.</p><p>Since the company\u2019s inception, ZestFinance has increased net repayment by 90 percent over industry scores and more than doubled the number of underbanked Americans the company serves.</p><p>It\u2019s no secret that one of the major areas where large-scale data mining is going to be hugely disruptive is in the financial services industry. It\u2019s unclear yet whether some of the incumbents (i.e. large financial institutions) will start adopting some of ZestFinance\u2019s models in underwriting, but the company is certainly an interesting acquisition target for any of the giants.</p>", "title": ["Data Focused Underwriting And Credit Analysis Platform ZestFinance Raises $20M From Peter Thiel And Others"], "author": ["Leena Rao"]},

I, for one, love that a flood of we-can-do-anything enthusiasm fueled by seemingly infinite cheap venture capital is disrupting all kinds of annoying, antiquated corners of the real world.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/groupon\">Groupon</a> is changing local business in a fundamental way, <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/airbnb\">Airbnb</a> is disrupting hotels and of course in San Francisco and New York, Uber has given people willing to pay just a little more a superior taxi experience.</p><p>But\u2013 as much as <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/uber-out-maths-google-on-nyc-etas/\">I love Uber</a>\u2014 a new Israeli-based startup called <a href=\"http://www.gettaxi.com/\">Get Taxi</a> is so ambitious it makes math-based, complex Uber look like a lemonade stand.</p><p>I don\u2019t mean this as a knock on Uber. Uber is building a company city-by-city in a sober rational way. Get Taxi is going huge, swinging for the fences. Obviously the bigger the initial ambition, the bigger risk it could fail big. (Just ask WebVan.)\u00a0And a big advantage is that <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/get-taxi\">Get Taxi</a> is skipping the US and launching in Europe, where the taxi industry is a lot easier to disrupt en masse because it\u2019s mostly made up of non-union independent contractors. (Refresher: Uber <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/25/ubercab-now-just-uber-shares-cease-and-desist-orders/\">invoked legal threats immediately</a> and can\u2019t even legally keep \u201ccab\u201d in its name.)</p><p>It launches in London in two weeks, Moscow in two months and cities in France and Germany soon after that. Forget proving a concept, it\u2019s launching in the largest cab markets first. And instead of focusing on limos and premium cars, Get Taxi is trying to replace dispatch systems in <em>all cabs</em> in <em>all major European cities</em>.</p><p>Like Uber, it has a glitzy iphone app and user experience that streamlines the ordering, tracking and payment. But it\u2019s also like OpenTable\u2013 providing hardware to cab drivers that coordinates pickups and payments. And to get inventory for those cabs it offers a concierge-like service for high-volume cab bookers like receptionists at law firms and concierges of hotels. More on all that in a bit.</p><p>Get Taxi is founded by serial entrepreneur <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/shahar-smirin\">Shahar Smirin</a> who splits his time between Israel, Russia, Silicon Valley and now, the various capitals of Europe. He also splits his time between several companies. Of late, he\u2019s been particularly consumed building <a href=\"http://www.vigoda.ru\">Vigoda.ru</a>, a daily deal site in Russia. Like a lot of daily deal sites, it\u2019s growing fast; 100% every three months he says. It\u2019s doing about $50 million in revenues and offering about 500 deals per week.</p><p>Talking about <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/vigoda\">Vigoda</a> and Get Taxi, Smirin kept referencing the importance of time-to-market. That\u2019s something I haven\u2019t heard much in Silicon Valley since the late 1990s. In fact, most of the big winners of late <em>haven\u2019t</em> been the first to market, whether it\u2019s Google in search or Facebook in social networking. The big winners have been the companies that took their time, and got the product exactly right.</p><p>But Smirin says the difference is those are pure Internet companies. What he\u2013 and others like Airbnb and Groupon\u2013 are building are not pure online companies. They\u2019re part online, part offline logistics companies. You need physical inventory, sales forces, a brand name, and in the case of Get Taxi hardware in as many cabs as possible.\u00a0In this category of companies, he says, you can\u2019t afford to be number two.</p><p>Looking at the wild landgrab happening in the daily deals category world-wide, you can see a lot of people agree with him\u2013 including Groupon, which has been the most international acquisitive startup I\u2019ve ever seen. Groupon\u2019s <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/10/you-spent-how-much-groupon-restructures-international-operations-as-mason-goes-to-china/\">money-bleeding international strategy</a> has very much been \u201cbuy now before anyone in any market gets too much traction, no matter the cost and ask questions later.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s one reason Smirin loves building these types of companies. It\u2019s anathema in Silicon Valley to say this, but his job as an Web entrepreneur isn\u2019t to just obsess about product all day long. He\u2019s executing on business model from day one, since these types of companies are disrupting pre-existing juicy markets, not creating new ones from whole cloth that people may or may not pay for. He\u2019s building sales teams and delivery models, as fast as he\u2019s looking for great engineers.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be the first to market and run fast,\u201d he said over lunch in San Francisco last week. Wow, did I just go back in time? That sounds a lot like a throwback to the early days of the Internet, and there\u2019s a good reason why. Back then, Web businesses weren\u2019t just about grabbing time as a billion people already came to this vast digital medium every day, they had to evangelize why you\u2019d go online to solve certain needs; why skeptics should \u201cgo to the Internet.\u201d People were so un-Web savvy that they had just enough confidence to go to the online travel site they knew, not explore around. That\u2019s not too different from the barriers of building a real-world physical business.</p><p>Get Taxi relies even more heavily on building a real-world logistical infrastructure than Smirin\u2019s Groupon clone. Like the daily deals sites and unlike the early Web 1.0 days, there\u2019s real and immediate market opportunity.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a $30 billion dollar per year market,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is not about features and eyeballs.\u201d</p><p>In Europe there are 600,000 taxis and most of them are independent contractors paying $5,000 per year for a dispatch service. In a classic Web play that uses the medium to disrupt a pricey middleman, Get Taxi promises to send cabs customers in a more efficient, more user friendly way for one-third of that price. Because there\u2019s no unions or exclusivity contracts, taxi drivers can use it as a secondary system. They pay month-by-month; if it doesn\u2019t bring them value, they can get rid of it. If it brings them value, the system quickly pays for itself. And if they\u2019re skeptical, Smirin will even let them try it free for two months to see what it can do.</p><p>Get Taxi is trying to do more than just bring drivers more riders, it\u2019s trying to solve pain points for drivers so they never go back to traditional dispatch services. For instance, not only does his five-inch hardware device sync with smart phones to handle the dispatch information in an Uber-like-way, it handles the payments. The service links the cab driver and the consumer by name, so the cab knows who it\u2019s picking up, the consumer knows where that cab is and that dramatically cuts down on no-shows.</p><p>The service has been running a full 24/7 beta test service in Israel for several months, and Smirin is confident he\u2019s ready for a London launch in August. It will be available on every smart phone from day one, and if you order a cab and Get Taxi doesn\u2019t have a driver in its network, it will call a competitor and book one for you. \u201cOur customer care philosophy is no excuses, no bullshit,\u201d he says.</p><p>The bigger challenge, since Get Taxi only has a month to prove his value to cabbies, is to get a flood of riders quickly. This is where the concierge-like part of the business comes in. Smirin seeks out businesses that regularly need a large volume of cabs\u2013 places like hotels, restaurants, law firms and other large companies. He set up an OpenTable-like consumer end for receptionists to easily call and manage taxis for guests, and like OpenTable, they get points the more cabs they book. In the last two weeks he\u2019s pre-signed 250 cabs in London and fifty businesses to send them traffic.</p><p>Get Taxi is obviously a big, gaudy, ambitiously crazy idea and fortunately Smirin has big pockets behind him. He\u2019s already put in several million dollars of his own money behind it, and he raised $9 million more from Russian billionaire industrialist Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries Fund. Among other assets, Blavatnik recently <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/05/warner-music-group-sold-for-3-billion-to-access-industries-len-blavatnik.html\">bought Warner Music</a> for $3.3 billion. Safe to say, there\u2019s more cash where that $9 million came from. It\u2019s also safe to say Get Taxi will need it.</p>", "title": ["Get Taxi Launching in London.

{"date": ["2012-03-29"], "text": "<p><a href=\"http://hailocab.com/\">Hailo,</a> a European mobile taxi network, is announcing a $17 million round of Series A financing led by Accel Partners. The company previously raised $3 million in seed funding from Wellington Partners and Atomico, who both participated in this round as well.</p><p>Hailo, which has been operating in London since last year, is a mobile network that matches passengers and licensed taxi drivers (a differentiation from Uber, which uses private black cars). Here\u2019s how it works (check out the video below as well). The Hailo Driver Network can be accessed via iPhone or Android apps is designed to be a taxi driver\u2019s companion and offers social features, advanced, private stats, sharing of traffic and demand events relevant to drivers. These apps also allow drivers to accept credit cards as well, and includes a tipping functionality.</p><p>The network aspect of the app allows drivers to access traffic patterns and problems, messages about where pickups are light or heavy, airport information and more. Along with this information, Hailo also offers an interface that will show drivers where pickups are ordered (through the Hailo consumer app), and will allow drivers to process these pickups seamlessly. Additionally, drivers can use the app for credit card processing for pickups unrelated to Hailo.</p><p>On the consumer side of things, Hailo\u2019s iPhone and Android apps allow you to order a licensed cab in a similar way you order a car with Uber. Once you open the app, Hailo will detect your location on a map and you can adjust where you\u2019d like to be picked up. The app will tell you how close the nearest drivers are to your location, and you can then request a pickup. When the driver is nearing arrival, the app will alert you of the arrival. You can also see a profile of the driver, his or her ratings and more.</p><p>In terms of payments, you are charged based on what the taxi\u2019s meter reads for the trip. With Hailo, you enter your credit card information once and the app will always use this information for payments without having to renter the details for each ride. Via the app you can choose to add a tip, as well as choose to pay via cash. A receipt will be emailed to you and you can rate the driver.</p><p><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/hailo2.png\" class=\"shot2\">Hailo has been downloaded nearly 200,000 times by consumers in London and over 3,200 taxi drivers have already downloaded the app since its launch last November. In London, the startup says its average pickup time is around two minutes, and the app has around 1,700 taxi drivers as active users.</p><p>As explained to me by CEO Jay Bregman, Hailo, which was co-founded by three London cab drivers and three technology entrepreneurs, is working on making the app appealing to both drivers and consumers. By offering a network that includes traffic, pickup, and other info, the startup is actually making Hailo useful to taxi drivers beyond just providing pickups. Bregman tells me, \u201cWe don\u2019t look at this as a transactional booking app. We are building an app that helps solve the fundamental pain points of being a driver.\u201d</p><p>The company also enlists drivers as the managers of operations in its cities. In London, Hailo is managed by three drivers, and in the startup\u2019s next stop, Dublin, current drivers will also help set up operations.</p><p>It\u2019s important to note that Hailo can work with any taxi company since it simply sits on top of the meter\u2014drivers manually input whatever the meter\u2019s amount is into the app for charges to go through. This enables drivers who don\u2019t pickup fares via the Hailo app to input a charge manually through the app for a credit card payment. Hailo makes money by taking a percentage of each fare that is processed via its consumer pickup app.</p><p>With $17 million in new funding in-hand, the startup is setting its sights on the U.S., looking to launch in Chicago, Boston, Washington D.C. and even New York. Although Bregman acknowledges that new York is a more challenging city to enter because of the heavy regulation of the taxi industry in the city.</p><p>And the company, explains Bregman, is not trying to provide taxi drivers with a full day\u2019s worth of work. Hailo wants to simply account for 10-20 percent of order volume and provide orders in downtime. He feels that taxi cab companies will be responsive to this because drivers will be more productive.</p><p>Accel partner Adam Valkin tells me, \u201cThis is a massive market and a market that is inefficient. Passengers are frustrated and drivers aren\u2019t making enough money. The smartphone is the tipping point.\u201d He adds that Hailo has thought carefully about the internationalization of the app and feels that the startup has a clear strategy for becoming a global leader in the space. Valkin, who is based in Accel\u2019s London office, will join the Hailo Board, and Palo Alto partner Sameer Gandhi will join the Board as an observer.</p><p>While Hailo has major ambitions of entering the U.S., the startup will certainly face competition from some of the more established and popular players. Uber has been <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/09/to-bbq-and-beyond-mobile-car-service-uber-moves-to-new-ground-at-sxsw/\">exploding in growth</a>, and armed with <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/07/uber-announces-32-million-in-funding/\">$32 million</a> of new funding, the company also has its <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/19/travis-kalanick-says-uber-will-drive-into-london-before-the-olympics/\">eyes on London</a><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/19/travis-kalanick-says-uber-will-drive-into-london-before-the-olympics/\">.</a> TaxiMagic also offers an <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/01/taximagic-launches-web-portal-for-online-taxi-booking/\">online taxi booking app</a> in the U.S. And GetTaxi is expanding in Europe.</p><p>Bur Bregman is confident that the model that has proven to be successful in London can be scaled quickly in the U.S. and even Canada. Already, Hailo has hired a Chicago general manager and is looking to quickly expand in the coming months.</p>", "title": ["Mobile Taxi Network Hailo Raises $17M From Accel And Atomico To Take On Uber In The U.S."], "author": ["Leena Rao"]},

{"date": ["2015-09-13"], "text": "<p></p><p>Patent reform, long a decidedly unsexy topic best discussed over a strong espresso, has been a hot topic in recent years. Even though Congress substantially overhauled the patent system just three and a half years ago with the passage of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leahy-Smith_America_Invents_Act\">the America Invents Act</a>, the continued public drumbeat (a drumbeat taken up by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/patent_report.pdf\">President Obama</a>, among others) against \u201cPatent Assertion Entities\u201d\u00a0(PAE), aka \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d has caused a continued beehive of patent reform activity in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://patentlyo.com/patent/2014/07/supreme-patent-decade.html\">Supreme Court and Congress. </a></p><p>In fact, the 113<sup>th</sup> Congress saw <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/03/effects-of-patent-troll-legislation-on-startups/\">no fewer than six legislative proposals</a> to further refine the patent system, before patent reform stalled in the Senate in 2014 in the face of apparent criticism by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/patent-reform-senate-106968.html\">trial lawyers, biotechnology firms and pharmaceutical companies</a>.</p><p>With the 114<sup>th</sup> Congress <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/09/08/recess_over_congress_has_a_pressing_fall_agenda_127992.html\">back in session</a>, patent reform is back on the table, with consensus forming around two bills with bipartisan support: the Innovation Act, which is being considered in the House and the PATENT Act, being considered in the Senate. These proposals share many features (and have some important differences) and have passed their respective Judiciary Committees, meaning they still need to be considered by the full Congress and signed by the President to pass. So what has Congress been up to? Let\u2019s take a look.</p><p>The Innovation Act (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/9/text\">H.R. 9</a>) was introduced by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://goodlatte.house.gov/pages/about-bob\">R-VA</a>) in February 2015, and already has 27 bipartisan co-sponsors. Representative Goodlatte was a driving force behind patent reform in the 113<sup>th</sup> Congress, as he collected a number of proposals from other proposed bills in a \u201cdiscussions draft\u201d that looks very similar to the Innovation Act.</p><p>The Protecting American Talent and Entrepreneurship Act, or PATENT Act, (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1137\">S. 1137</a>) is the Senate counterpart to the House\u2019s Innovation Act. Introduced by Senator Chuck Grassley (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.grassley.senate.gov/about/biography\">R-IA</a>) in April 2015, it has a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s1137\">37 percent chance</a> of enactment and has 6 bipartisan co-sponsors.</p><p>Both bills share a number of similar proposals, including:</p><p><strong>Heightened Pleading Requirements.</strong> Patent plaintiffs generally do not need to provide extensive detail regarding the alleged infringement in their complaints. This has led to criticisms that patent trolls can file poorly investigated claims to impose discovery costs on their opponents. Both bills contain a number of requirements that would increase the amount of detail a patent plaintiff would have to include in a complaint. This would make patent cases more expensive to bring in the first instance.</p><p><strong>Patent Ownership Transparency.</strong>\u00a0Both bills contain provisions to improve transparency into who is really behind a patent assertion, as patent assertion entities that are effectively judgment-proof are often created to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100217/1853298215.shtml\">obscure the party that is truly interested in the litigation</a>.</p><p><strong>Customer/End-User Stays.</strong>\u00a0Both bills contain provisions that would permit a stay of a suit brought against a downstream user in order to let the provider of the allegedly infringing product\u00a0duke it out with the patent holder directly, instead of the customer. There has been a persistent call for provisions of this type since at least a 2011 campaign by a PAE called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/cisco-strikes-deal-to-pay-wi-fi-patent-troll-3-2-cents-per-router/\">Innovatio against small business that operated Cisco Wi-Fi products</a>.</p><p><strong>Demand Letters.</strong> Patent trolls have been criticized for broadly distributing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://trollingeffects.org/letters\">vague, misleading letters</a> demanding payment for a license; they leave the recipient scratching their heads as to the extent of their liability, yet fearful enough of the costs of litigation to entertain entering into a license. Both bills contain provisions to address this problem, though the PATENT Act does so with more clarity as it establishes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1137/text#toc-idb7ed2f8c3c07478784ce29940b648eb3\">a list of details</a> that must be included in demand letters and a \u201cclear and detailed\u201d description of why each patent is infringed.</p><p>The PATENT Act also empowers the FTC to crack down on abusive demand letters. The Innovation Act more generically provides that a demand letter must include \u201cbasic information\u201d about the infringement allegation in order to be legally relevant, and states that \u201cpurposely evasive demand letters\u201d are improper and potentially punishable in litigation.</p><p><strong>Discovery Limits.</strong>\u00a0PAE lawsuits often lead to quick settlements because defendants cannot bear the cost of full-blown civil discovery. Both bills try to reduce these costs by commissioning the court system to fashion rules to limit discovery regarding \u201cnon-core\u201d documents, with the goal of limiting a case to the technical and financial information that realistically relates to a plaintiff\u2019s claim. In addition, the Innovation Act limits discovery until the issuance of a \u201cclaim construction\u201d order defining the patent(s) at issue (which is often a dispositive event in patent litigation), while the PATENT Act precludes any discovery until the resolution of certain preliminary motions.</p><p><strong>Fee Shifting.</strong>\u00a0By far the most controversial aspect of both bills are the provisions they contain regarding the shifting of attorney fees. Attorney fee shifting was previously discussed in the 113<sup>th</sup> Congress in the context of the SHIELD Act, which received interest, but ultimately did not mature into a bill.\u00a0Again, both bills propose making it easier for winners to recover legal fees from losers, with the Innovation Act making it the easiest.</p><p>The Innovation Act would make recovery of fees easier by directing courts to make the presumption that a winner should recover its legal fees in a patent suit unless the losing party shows it was \u201creasonably justified\u201d in litigating or identifies other \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d that make the award unjust. The PATENT Act also authorizes fees if the losing party was not acting in an \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d manner, but without any presumption that fees will be awarded.</p><p>Of course, a defendant has to actually litigate a case to victory prior to becoming eligible for attorney fees, but the threat of an attorney fee award may deter PAEs from filing a weak case to begin with. Critics have complained that attorney fee-shifting provisions may result in chilling patent lawsuits by small businesses, inventors and universities that may otherwise be meritorious.</p><p><strong>Other provisions.</strong> The bills together also contain a number of less significant changes, though still important, changes such as technical changes to Patent Office rules governing review of already-issued patents (the Innovation Act, in particular, seeks to somewhat curtail the use of the Patent Office to invalidate issued patents), community outreach measures, calls for continued studies, and the protection of patent licenses in bankruptcy.</p><p>These bills have the aggregate effect of moving the needle in favor of patent defendants; therefore, the groups favoring and opposing the bills have fallen into somewhat predictable camps. Technology companies and their lobbyists in the software and high-tech industries that have been victimized by PAE lawsuits in the past, such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://judiciary.house.gov/_cache/files/1935de44-2cf7-4107-939e-0cd9cd677d27/114-17-93896.pdf\">Overstock.com</a> and\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.siia.net/Press/SIIA-Says-Judiciary-Passage-of-The-Innovation-Act-is-Positive-Sign-for-Patent-Reform\">The Software &amp; Information Industry Association, </a>have applauded the legislation.</p><p>Their enthusiasm has been shared by USPTO Director Michelle Lee, who has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://judiciary.house.gov/_cache/files/8e33d461-7e7c-49db-ad8f-b623e424485e/114-20-94184.pdf\">testified</a> that she was pleased the House reintroduced the Innovation Act and supported the fee-shifting presumption. But there\u00a0also are many critics of the Innovation Act, including universities, venture capital associations and pharmaceutical associations, such as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aau.edu/policy/article.aspx?id=15923\">Association of American Universities, </a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2015/03/19/senate-hearing-on-patent-reform-finds-consensus/id=55914/\">Association of University Technology Managers, Association of Public &amp; Land-Grant Universities and Innovation Alliance. </a></p><p>In June 2015, these critics released a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://innovationalliance.net/from-the-alliance/joint-statement-aau-aplu-ia-mdma-nvca-usij-house-judiciary-committee-markup-h-r-9/\">joint statement</a> asserting that the proposed changes will \u201charm U.S. competitiveness and undermine a patent system that has been critical to incentivizing innovation and job creation in our country for more than 200 years.\u201d\u00a0 With that being said, the PATENT Act seems to have found some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/240521-outside-groups-largely-support-senate-patent-bill\">tepid support</a> by some detractors of the Innovation Act, largely because fee shifting does not occur by \u201cpresumption,\u201d as in the Innovation Act.</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/03/effects-of-patent-troll-legislation-on-startups/\">The last time we covered patent reform</a>, we noted that there was some consensus forming around provisions that would be palatable enough to pass. The Innovation Act and PATENT Act of this term show that there is significant legislative consensus forming, within the Judiciary Committees at least, as to measures such as pleading standards, abusive demand letters and streamlining discovery.\u00a0However, there is still significant opposition to either bill in their current forms, and particularly to the aggressive fee-shifting provisions in the Innovation Act.\u00a0In addition, it\u2019s not clear how the differences in both bills will be ironed out by the House and Senate, making <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/253074-goodlatte-predicts-patent-vote-but-offers-no-timeline\">passage this term</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/technology/249169-patent-reform-defectors-emerge-in-house\">looking less certain by the day</a>.</p><p>That being said, there remains significant support for patent reform, and if a law passes in the form of either the Innovation Act or the PATENT Act, it would be the continuation of a trend that has taken place over the last\u00a010 years to reduce the strength of individual patents in favor of accused infringers. Technology companies that are developing their IP strategy should therefore pay attention to the patent reform debate, and companies with established portfolios should reassess the value of their portfolio in the current legal environment.</p>", "title": ["Patent Reform Tries Again"], "author": ["Lisa Patel", "Sid Venkatesan"]},
{"date": ["2012-06-06"], "text": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everloop.com/\">Everloop</a>, the social network for children under 13, is planning to launch a mobile application, making it one of the first companies to attempt a mobile, social network just for kids. The app, arriving in the third week of June, will translate the desktop experience to the small screen, beginning with iOS (iPhone &amp; iPod Touch) before heading to other platforms like Android.</p><p>The company, which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/12/social-network-for-kids-everloop-lands-3-1-million-in-new-funding/\">closed a seed round of $3.1 million last year</a>, is also in the process of raising its Series A and is in search of a strategic investor to help it expand.</p><p>Although Everloop is now <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://everloop.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/305851-how-everloop-started\">three and half years old</a>, the company\u2019s slow growth has been by design, explains CEO Hilary DeCesare. \u201cSomething like this takes time to build up,\u201d she says, \u201cyou don\u2019t just come out and say, \u2018hey, we\u2019re a safe site for kids.'\u201d</p><p>Today, the company reports that 200,000 children and around 75,000 parents are using its service on the web, and it has been growing around 10% to 15% month-over-month during the past year.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to operate in the social networking space without the inevitable Facebook comparison, but news of Everloop\u2019s expansion to mobile comes at an interesting time. Facebook is reportedly now mulling over whether or not it can allow children under 13 to join its network, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303506404577444711741019238.html\">a recent report from the WSJ</a>. If that were to happen, it goes without saying that Everloop would soon be facing some steep competition. So the question is not whether or not Everloop can exist outside of Facebook\u2019s shadow \u2013 Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram have proven it\u2019s possible to establish a social audience beyond Facebook\u2019s gates. The question is whether or not kids would ever willingly choose Everloop if Facebook officially opened up to them.</p><p>For what it\u2019s worth, Everloop is structured differently than Facebook \u2013 it\u2019s focused more around children\u2019s interests, which it calls \u201cloops.\u201d These can be based on anything at all, whether entertainment (think Justin Bieber, Twilight), sports, animals (golden retrievers, kittens), etc. And the interests are supplemented by content provided by Everloop\u2019s now 25 brand partners, a group which includes big names like National Geographic, Mattel, Simon &amp; Schuster, Harper Collins, and others. (Many are listed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everloop.com/\">on the company\u2019s homepage</a>).</p><p>In addition \u2013 and key to Everloop\u2019s value proposition to parents \u2013 is its ability to teach children about what\u2019s appropriate on social networking services. If a child posts using swear words, attempts cyberbullying, or engages in any other inappropriate behavior, Everloop doesn\u2019t allow the content to be posted and tells the child why. \u201cAll kids try to push the envelope,\u201d says\u00a0DeCesare, \u201cbut when they do, we want to notify them.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/06/kid-friendly-social-network-everloop-is-coming-to-iphone-raising-series-a/everloop-iphone/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-566567\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/everloop-iphone.png?w=640&amp;h=385\" alt=\"\" title=\"everloop-iphone\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-566567\" height=\"385\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p>The in-house moderation team consists of a staff of three plus a community manager, but the company has been scaling its moderation with assistance from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.metaversemodsquad.com/\">Metaverse Mod Squad</a>, which assists in reviewing the site\u2019s content.</p><p>As for the kids, there a number of features they might enjoy, including games, music, videos, the aforementioned \u201cloops,\u201d as well as an incredibly goofy (and therefore, popular) feature called \u201c<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.everloop.com/pub/index.php/goobs\">Goobs</a>.\u201d These are something like harmless pranks, explains DeCesare. They let you toilet paper someone\u2019s screen, for example, throw food or squash bugs on the screen. There\u2019s also one with a puppy that throws up on the screen then licks it. (I know, gross. But apparently, this is really hilarious to kids). \u201cWe want to bring out kids\u2019 whimsical side,\u201d says DeCesare, \u201ckids grow up way too fast.\u201d</p><p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/06/kid-friendly-social-network-everloop-is-coming-to-iphone-raising-series-a/goobed/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-566566\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/goobed.png?w=640&amp;h=398\" alt=\"\" title=\"goobed\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-566566\" height=\"398\" width=\"640\"></a></p><p>These \u201cGoobs\u201d will translate to the mobile app, which also aims to \u201chelp kids stay kids,\u201d DeCesare says. Kids text all the time, and Everloop on mobile will feel something like texting combined with graphics. And it will allow kids to keep up with their \u201cloops\u201d (interests), post to their loops, and stay in touch with friends in a safe, moderated, cyberbully-free environment.</p><p>Another plus for kids, is that, even though parents are kept informed of what kids are doing on Everloop through notifications, they can\u2019t\u00a0embarrass\u00a0kids by actually commenting on their posts. (That\u2019s a lesson which more parents <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://myparentsjoinedfacebook.com/\">should take heed of</a> on Facebook, too.)</p><p>Perhaps Facebook will soon figure out how to bring in kids to its network and keep them safe, but DeCesare has her doubts. \u201cThe way we\u2019ve developed Everloop is that we\u2019ve thought of the kids first,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at Facebook, they\u2019re really had bad corporate\u00a0governance around identity with adults. Our attitude is that if they can\u2019t keep adults\u2019 information safe, how are they planning on doing that with kids? If you look at their open architecture that they have set their business on \u2013 which is \u2018let everyone see everything you have to say about everything\u2019 \u2013 it goes against their structure to have something like a closed environment for kids.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true that Facebook\u2019s general agenda and many parents\u2019 agenda for their children don\u2019t necessarily match up. But Everloop faces a problem that a kid-friendly Facebook would not \u2013 its audience keeps growing up, and is then forced to leave the site.</p>", "title": ["Kid-Friendly Social Network Everloop Is Coming To iPhone, Raising Series A"], "author": ["Sarah Perez"]},

{"date": ["2009-11-30"], "text": "<p><img src=\"http://img.mobypicture.com/6b9db8b3b447c04bd5a8dc7937352869_new_medium.jpg\" class=\"shot2\">At the first ever outing of the brand new (and quite high level) <a href=\"http://www.noah-conference.com/\">NOAH Conference</a> in London a clutch of European companies, most mid-to-late stage startups, set out their wares to a broad range of European VCs, private equity people and bankers. Was it a pitch event? It was hard to say, but among them was a round-up from Shakil Khan, effectively <a href=\"http://Spotify.com\">Spotify\u2019s</a> <em>consigliari</em>, who wrapped up the company\u2019s stats and opened the kimono a little on where it\u2019s at.</p><p>The headline points from his talk were that we can, as we expected, see a US launch in Q1 2010 as well as a launch in Germany and China in Q1/2 (so no pressure then). Spotify will also extend from its existing handset deals into premium services on other platforms in 2010. They are talking to TV manufacturers about embedding Spotify into internet-enabled TV sets and Khan said they now get \u201ca call a week\u201d from games console makers which want to add Spotify to their service.</p><p>He also went through a round-up of its stats and model to date.</p><p>As we know it was conceived to be \u201cmore attractive than music piracy\u201d and combines premium and subscription model. It\u2019s probably not been emphasised enough that it was actually started in 2006, based on investment from the founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon who then spent the next two years on planes trying to negotiate global content licenses with all the record labels. As we now know, that came with a price as all major labels now have an interest in Spotify.</p><p>It now covers 6 markets in Europe (Sweden, Norway, Finland, UK, France, Spain) and has launched deals with mobile networks 3UK and Telia in the last month. Prior to this lots of music startups launched without negotiating with the labels \u2013 Spotify did the reverse. Khan said the most prevalent question they got from labels was \u201cWhat will happen to our CD sales?\u201d.</p><p>Spotify now has 6 milion users \u2013 3 million users in the UK, with the next biggest market being Sweden. It carried 6.34 million tracks, has 120 staff in its 6 countries and 50,000 users per day join the service. It has mobile applications live on the iPhone, Android and Symbian.</p><p>It\u2019s done no formal marketing as such, but although Khan made a big deal about not paying a PR agency, he did admit they have a full time internal PR person. But it is maintaining its invite only policy \u2013 although some observers point out that this may be down to issues scaling revenues to cover music rights payments than the technology itself, which is peer to peer.</p><p>Interestingly the average engagement time is 94 minutes a day which compares favourably to the average for websites which is 10-20mins. Why\u2019s that? Khan says it\u2019s because people are starting to use Spotify as a music platform to replace traditional entertainment systems like CDs (I know that\u2019s definitely the case in my household).</p><p>On the mobile Spotify also allows you to hold 3,333 songs in the device for offline playing (that\u2019s for premium users only).</p><p><strong>The future for Spotify</strong></p><p>The US is a high prioity, says Khan, and number one on their agenda for Q1 2010. They delayed the launch 2 weeks ago to make sure it goes right.</p><p>China is also going to be a huge market for Spotify. Khan knows it well \u2013 he launched and exited an internet advertising company in China years before it even appeared on most people\u2019s radar.</p><p>He says the number one online activity there is music and guess what, \u201cno-one buys music in China\u201d.</p><p>Device wise Spotify \u201cwould like to be everywhere\u201d, even if it has a \u201cpartial connection\u201d like a car. They are looking to be in TV Screens, gaming consoles, but likely more for premium users only rather than free, ad-supoorted users.</p><p>It was interesting to hear a re-cap of Spoify\u2019s investment history, The first 8m Euros was pumped in by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, who were followed by Creandum, Northzone. Later Wellington Partners and Hutchinson Wampoa Chairman Li Ka-Shing invested. It also has two Angel investors: Klaus Hommels and, it turns out, Shakil Khan.</p>", "title": ["Spotify heads towards TVs, gaming consoles and China"], "author": ["Mike Butcher"]},

Nintendo\u2019s Chief Executive Satoru Iwata told a press conference today that its next-generation console will be called NX, and is currently under development with a \u201cbrand new concept.\u201d</p><p>What Nintendo didn\u2019t do was give us any indication of what NX is, or when it might arrive. Iwata did say that we\u2019ll learn more about it next year, meaning it could make an initial appearance at E3 2016 or at its own dedicated unveiling. The news might be a candid admission that Wii U hasn\u2019t been the home console Nintendo had hoped for, which might lead to a fast-forward refresh in the form of the NX, vs. an update cycle more in time with its competitors Sony and Microsoft.</p><p>Nintendo\u2019s purpose with this press conference was to elaborate on its decision to ship smartphone games and describe the form they would take (they won\u2019t just port existing games to mobile platforms, Iwata says, since that would \u201cruin the value of Nintendo\u2019s IP\u201d). The NX mention in this context seems like a reassurance regarding the company\u2019s continued plans to innovate in the dedicated gaming market, but if Iwata is hoping for a 2016 reveal, that would still be an accelerated refresh cycle vs. previous console generations.</p><p>That \u201cbrand new concept\u201d tidbit is interesting: It could just be straightforward marketing bluster, but Nintendo also probably knows it needs to wow with a Wii U follow-up. It\u2019d be interesting to see them offer a take on VR, given its growing popularity among hardware companies, but it could also be a machine more in line with the competition in terms of power under the hood and media service offerings.</p>", "title": ["Nintendo Teases NX, Its Next Dedicated Gaming Console"], "author": ["Darrell Etherington"]},

Previously the one-year-old Cabulous was backed by around $1 million in seed funding, so this brings its total investment to about $9 million. Cabulous, which has 15 full-time staff, is also announcing the appointment of Silicon Valley tech veteran Mark Towfiq as its CTO.</p><p>You can watch the video embedded above to see my interview with Cabulous CEO Steven Humphreys to get the full rundown on what Cabulous does and how the new funding will be put to use.</p><p>I\u2019ve personally been a big fan of Cabulous for months now. The app, which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://cabulous.com/Products/\">is available</a> on the web, iOS and Android, is super straightforward: It shows you a map filled with little moving icons of the available taxicabs in your area. You digitally \u201chail\u201d the cab you want to take by clicking on the icon and entering your phone number and exact address. You can pay for the cab the old-fashioned way (in the car) or through the Cabulous app using your credit card. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/screen-shot-2012-06-21-at-10-11-46-am.png\"><img src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/screen-shot-2012-06-21-at-10-11-46-am.png?w=300&amp;h=152\" alt=\"\" title=\"Cabulous\" width=\"300\" height=\"152\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-575941\"></a></p><p>It\u2019s totally free on the consumer side \u2014 Cabulous makes money by selling its service at the taxicab fleet level as a subscription, and it provides stripped-down Android tablets and mobile phones that cabbies can install in their vehicles to run the app. Humphreys tells me that cab companies love it because it cuts down on their costs of running telephone dispatch services, and cab drivers love it because it gets them more customers (Cabulous says it helps drivers increase their monthly income by 20 percent on average.) Something like 50 percent of all cabs are empty at any given time, so there is a ton of efficiency to be gained by plugging them into a digital network.</p><p>Of course, Cabulous is not without competition. A Europe-based company named GetTaxi <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/06/gettaxi-20-million-funding-new-york-city-us-expansion/\">recently snagged $20 million</a> in funding that it plans to use to expand into the United States, while on-demand car service startup Uber has <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/18/uber-experiments-with-lower-priced-taxis-in-chicago-through-newly-launched-labs-group-garage/\">started to dabble</a> in the regular taxicab space. Humphreys tells me that while he thinks there is more than enough room for several players in the market, Cabulous is uniquely positioned because of its patented dispatch system and the way that it addresses the industry at the fleet level, rather than through individual drivers.</p><p>Cabulous has 1000 US taxis in its fleet today (more than 200 of which are in San Francisco) and is processing 100,000 rides per month, so it already has a very strong foothold. It\u2019ll be cool to see how much it grows now that it is backed by serious funding.</p>", "title": ["Cabulous Raises $8 Million Series A To Expand Mobile Taxi Dispatch Network "], "author": ["Colleen Taylor"]},

To enable this, you simply enter your Twitter username into a box, and Google will go out and crawl your (public) Twitter friends to see what links they\u2019re sharing.</p><p>Here\u2019s Google\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/news/bin/answer.py?answer=1039361\">rundown</a> of how this experimental feature works:</p><p>Google\u2019s search deal with Twitter undoubtedly makes this feature possible. But it will be interesting to see if this test ever sees the full light of day, especially after Google\u2019s social layer launches. It\u2019s a good idea \u2014 not unlike what Flipboard and a host of other services do \u2014 and it could make Google News, which is typically slow and relatively stale, full of fresh content.</p><p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/marissa-mayer\">Marrisa Mayer</a> has made it very clear that <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/google-instant-upgrade/\">she loves Twitter</a> \u2014 though she won\u2019t comment on half-jokes about when Google will attempt to buy them.
